I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The cashier was on break when a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude, then another write-up for arguing when explaining their situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the cashier worked through a busy morning without a break, only getting one after being told by the manager. They were clearly stressed and needed to use the bathroom. When approached by the customer, the cashier was on a scheduled break, so they were allowed to step away from their register. However, the customer was asking for help within the store, not at the register. \n\nIn many retail jobs, employees are expected to assist customers even when not at their station, unless they're specifically on break. If the cashier was on a break, they might not be required to help. But the manager's perspective is that the customer needed assistance, and the cashier was being rude by ignoring them. The cashier's reasoning was that they had to relieve themselves and wanted to avoid long conversations, which they had experienced before. \n\nThe cashier might not be in the wrong if they were on a break and not at their register. But if the store's policy is that employees should assist customers even on break, then they could be in the wrong. The manager's reaction seems harsh, but the cashier might have violated a policy. However, the manager also seems to be strict and possibly not considering the cashier's situation. \n\nThe key points are: was the cashier on break when approached? If yes, and the policy allows breaks without being disturbed, then maybe they're okay. But if the policy expects employees to help customers even on break, then they're at fault. The cashier's explanation about needing the bathroom adds context, but the manager didn't accept it. \n\nConsidering all that, the cashier might not be entirely at fault. They were following their manager's instruction to take a break. However, ignoring a customer entirely could be seen as rude. A better approach might have been to acknowledge the customer and explain they were on break but could point them in the right direction after their break. But since the eggs were visible nearby, maybe the cashier thought it wasn't necessary. \n\nThe manager's response seems excessive, but the policy might be clear. The cashier was probably in the right to take the break as instructed, but the way they handled the customer could have been better. So, maybe the cashier is not entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
