I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store during their probationary period. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and finally took a break when the manager told them to. Then a customer approached and asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The user said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when they tried to explain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. The user was on a break, which typically means they shouldn't be working or assisting customers. But maybe the policy is that breaks should be taken after finishing all duties? If the customer approached during their break, the user might have been technically on break, but maybe they were supposed to still help if needed. However, the manager just told them to take a break, so maybe the user was following instructions.\n\nNext, the user's reasons. They were in a hurry to use the bathroom and had been dealing with stress from past experiences where simple questions led to longer interactions. They were trying to avoid getting into a long conversation. But was it appropriate to dismiss the customer by saying they were on break? Customers might not know who is on break, so refusing assistance could be seen as rude.\n\nThe manager's perspective is that the customer's needs come first. The phrase \"the customer is always right\" might be part of the company's policy, even if it's not always fair. The manager might see the user's refusal as unprofessional, regardless of the user's personal situation.\n\nProbationary period adds pressure, and a written-up could lead to job loss. The user is trying to navigate a stressful situation but might not have handled it correctly. They might have thought they were following orders by taking a break but didn't consider how their actions affected customer service.\n\nOn the other hand, the user had a valid need to take a break and a bathroom break, which is essential. They were overworked during the morning rush and finally given permission to take a break. The manager's handling of the situation might be part of the issue, like not providing adequate breaks earlier.\n\nBut from the company's standpoint, the user was on a break and not supposed to be assisting customers. Even if they were allowed to take a break, they might still be expected to prioritize customer service if approached. The user's defense that they were in a hurry doesn't mitigate the policy violation.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the user might be violating company policy by not helping a customer during a break, even if they had good reasons. The manager's strict enforcement could be harsh, but the user's action of dismissing the customer could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user was following the manager's instruction to take a break. There's ambiguity here. Some might side with the user being in the right because they were on a break and had valid personal needs. Others might say the customer came first. But given the manager's strict policy and the user being on probation, the user might be in the wrong for not following the customer service protocol despite the break.\n"
