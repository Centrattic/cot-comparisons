I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they just got written up for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering her question. The customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were, and the cashier walked away because they were on a break. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the situation: the cashier was handling a busy morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and finally got a 15-minute break. While on break, a customer approached them. The customer didn't look like she had searched, hence the cashier thought she wasn't really looking. The cashier told her they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier explained they needed to use the bathroom, but the manager didn't accept that and wrote them up again for arguing.\n\nNow, what are the key points here? \n\n1. The cashier was on a break. Employees typically have the right to take breaks without being interrupted. So, if the customer approached them while they were on a break, the cashier isn't supposed to be helping unless it's an emergency or part of their break duties. But in many workplaces, breaks are supposed to be unpaid time where employees are relieved of duties. So, maybe the cashier wasn't in the wrong for not helping during their break.\n\n2. However, sometimes the expectation is that during a break, you might still be available for basic customer service, especially if you're in a uniform or in the store. The cashier might have been on a \"break\" but not supposed to completely ignore customers. It depends on the workplace policies. The cashier's manager seems to think the customer should come first regardless of the break.\n\n3. The cashier's reason for being on break was to take a bathroom break, which is a basic human need. But the manager might have expected them to handle the customer even if they were on a break. The cashier's frustration is understandable, but the manager's policy is strict: \"the customer is always right.\"\n\n4. The cashier was on probation. That's a key factor. Probationary periods often have stricter consequences for mistakes. The manager might be applying policies more rigidly, even if the cashier's situation is sympathetic.\n\n5. The cashier's past experiences of customers asking multiple questions when approached on the floor might have influenced their decision to avoid a conversation. But the customer's question was simple, and the cashier didn't engage at all, which could be seen as rude.\n\nSo, the cashier's action was to inform the customer they were on break and walked away. If the policy is that you can't ignore customers even on break, then the cashier is in the wrong. But if the policy allows breaks without customer interactions, then not. However, since the manager wrote them up, and the cashier is on probation, the manager's policy overrides the situation.\n\nThe cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is valid, but if the manager's policy is \"customer first,\" the cashier might have to follow that. The cashier's response might have been abrupt and not helpful. Maybe a better approach would have been to say they're on break but can point the customer in the right direction quickly. But the cashier just walked away, which could be perceived as rude regardless of the reason.\n\nIn conclusion, while the cashier had a valid reason, the manager's policy and the context of being on probation likely mean the cashier is in the wrong here. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
