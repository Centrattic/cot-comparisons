I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The cashier is on a break and is approached by a customer asking where Cadbury Cream eggs are. The cashier says they're on break and walks away. The manager then writes them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the context: the cashier had just finished a busy shift without a break, had to manage the morning rush alone, and was finally given a 15-minute break. They need to use the bathroom, so they're eager to take that break. The customer comes up and asks a question. The cashier responds that they're on break.\n\nBut wait, the key point here is whether the cashier was actually on break when the customer approached. The manager told them to take a 15-minute break, so technically, once they're on break, they can't engage in customer service. However, the way the cashier handled it might be an issue. Instead of politely directing the customer to find the product themselves or to another employee, they just said they were on break and walked away. That could come off as rude, even if they were on break. \n\nIn most workplaces, especially in customer service roles, employees are expected to be polite and helpful even if they're not working. If the cashier was on break, maybe they should have offered to help briefly or pointed the customer in the right direction. The manager's reaction might be harsh, but the cashier's response could be seen as unprofessional. They might have been in the wrong for not handling the situation more gracefully, even if they were on break. So, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe not, because they were on break. Hmm.\n"
