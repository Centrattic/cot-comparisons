I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier on probation, handling the morning rush alone. Then, after being told to take a break, they were approached by a customer asking about Cadbury Cream eggs. The cashier says they were on break and walked away. But the manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to engage in a potentially lengthy conversation.\n\nFirst, the key points: the cashier was on a break when approached. If they were officially on break, they might not be expected to help customers. However, in many jobs, especially customer service roles, employees are supposed to be available even during breaks unless they're in a designated break area. The manager's reaction suggests that the customer's interaction was considered a priority.\n\nThe cashier's reasoning is about needing to use the bathroom and avoiding a long conversation. But if they were on break, the manager might expect them to take care of personal needs during that time. The fact that the customer approached them on the floor could mean the cashier was still in a visible area where customers might expect assistance. \n\nAlso, the cashier's previous experience of complex questions adds context, but the customer's question here was stated to be simple. The cashier's judgment about the customer not looking might be a factor, but that's subjective. The manager's perspective is that the customer deserved assistance regardless of the cashier's break time. \n\nThe cashier's union might be a resource for appealing the write-up, but the question is about whether they were in the wrong. The rules likely require employees to be available during their shifts unless on a break in a specified area. If the cashier was on a break and in a public area, they might still be expected to help or direct the customer to another staff member. \n\nSo, the cashier might have violated company policy by not assisting the customer during their shift, even if they were on a break. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
