I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is presented in the context of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling a rush alone, didn't get a break, and finally took a 15-minute break as instructed by their manager. While on break, a customer approached and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The author told them they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and even more so when the author tried to explain their reasoning. \n\nThe author's defense is that they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want another long conversation. They also mention that past experiences with customers made them wary of engaging. The manager's response was strict, leading to a write-up and potential job loss.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are workplace policies and customer service expectations. Even if the author was on a break, if they were in the store (maybe in uniform or visible to customers), there might be an expectation to assist unless they are in a designated break area. However, if they were explicitly told to take a break and physically stepping away from their post, then perhaps they were within their rights. \n\nHowever, customer service roles often require employees to be helpful even during breaks if they are in the premises. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and not assisting could lead to a bad customer experience. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid need (using the bathroom) and the manager had told them to take a break. If the break was supposed to be a time away from duties, then the manager might be at fault for not providing adequate coverage. But the author's response to the customer might be seen as rude, regardless of their reasons. \n\nSo, considering the policies and the immediate action, the author might have been in the wrong for not assisting, even if they were on break. But there's also the aspect of the manager's responsibility to ensure coverage and not letting the cashier go without a break. However, the question is about the author's actions. If the company policy states that employees must assist customers even during breaks, then the author is in the wrong. If the break was meant to be a complete respite, then the manager is at fault. \n\nGiven the information, the author might have violated the company's customer service policy by not helping, even if they were on a break. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, the manager's handling might be poor, but that's a separate issue. The focus is on the author's action of refusing assistance.\n"
