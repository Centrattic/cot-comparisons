I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier was on a break and avoided helping a customer who asked a simple question. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and now they're feeling bad because they could lose their job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. If the employee was on a break, they're supposed to be away from their duties. Approaching a customer during a break might not be allowed, especially if the manager told them to take a break. However, if the employee was in a common area and the customer approached them, maybe the employee is expected to help even if they're on a break. That depends on company policy.\n\nThe cashier mentions that they had been working without a break and needed to use the bathroom. They were on a probationary period, which probably means they're more vulnerable to being written up. The manager's reaction was strict, giving a write-up for not answering the customer and then another for arguing. \n\nThe employee's excuse is that they were on break, but maybe the manager's instruction was to take a break but still remain available in case of emergencies or customer needs. If the store's policy requires employees to assist customers even during breaks when not at their register, then the cashier might be in the wrong. However, if the break is supposed to be a full break where they can step away, then the manager's expectations might be unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. The customer asked a simple question, and the cashier didn't engage. That could be seen as rude regardless of the employee's reasons. But the employee had a valid personal need (needing to use the bathroom) and might have been in a rush. The manager's response seems harsh, but the employee's action might still be against the rules.\n\nIn many workplaces, breaks are supposed to be undisturbed, but employees are often expected to be on call. If the cashier was on a break but in the store, they might be expected to help if approached. However, if the break is a paid rest period where they're supposed to be off-duty, then the manager's write-up is unfair. The key here is understanding the company's specific policies on breaks.\n\nThe employee's history of similar issues (like getting into long conversations) might make the manager more strict, but the initial write-up for not answering could still be valid. The manager also wrote up the employee for arguing when they were just explaining their situation, which might indicate a problem with the manager's approach.\n\nIn summary, whether the employee is in the wrong depends on company policy. If the policy states that employees must assist customers even during breaks when not at their station, then yes, the employee is in the wrong. If the break is meant to be a full break, then the manager's action is unfair. Since the user hasn't provided the exact policy, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many retail environments, employees are expected to be available to assist even during breaks unless they're in a designated break area. Given that, the employee might be in the wrong because they didn't help the customer despite being on a break. But the manager's handling is also questionable, especially the second write-up for explaining versus arguing. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't assist the customer even though they were on a break, which could be part of their duties. However, the manager's strictness is also a problem. But the initial action of the employee was to not help, which is against typical retail expectations, so A might be the answer.\n"
