I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a cashier who was on break when a customer approached asking about Cadbury Cream eggs. The cashier told the customer she was on break and walked away, leading to a write-up from the manager. The cashier is worried about being fired since they're on probation and have a history of write-ups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Generally, employees are expected to be available for customer service unless on a scheduled break. Even if the cashier was on a break, she might be expected to assist if the break wasn't official or if the manager hadn't formally assigned her to take a break. The manager told her to take a 15-minute break, so maybe she was allowed to step away, but perhaps she wasn't supposed to be completely unavailable. \n\nThe cashier mentions not having a bathroom break since 5:30 AM, which is a valid concern. However, the manager might expect her to handle breaks during designated times or to ask for a break when needed. If she was told to take a break, maybe she should have gone to the break room instead of wandering the store. \n\nAlso, the way she handled the customer's question\u2014saying she was on break and walking away\u2014might be seen as rude, regardless of her personal situation. The manager emphasized the \"customer is always right\" policy, which could mean that even if she was on a break, she should have directed the customer or asked a nearby coworker for help. \n\nBut there's context: she was already stressed, on probation, and had a history of write-ups. The manager might be applying the policy strictly, but the cashier's need for a bathroom break is a basic necessity. However, employees are usually trained to manage such needs by scheduling breaks properly. Maybe she should have communicated her need to take a scheduled break earlier or handled the break in the break room rather than the floor.\n\nIn terms of policy vs. empathy. The company's policy likely prioritizes customer service, so even if the cashier was on break, being on the floor might not excuse her from assisting. But the manager's response seems harsh if she was in the process of taking a break as instructed. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The key points are whether she was on a proper break and if she should have handled the customer's request differently. If the manager told her to take a break, maybe she was allowed to step away, but being on the break in the store might not mean she's exempt from all duties. Alternatively, the manager's strict write-up without considering her circumstances might be part of the issue. \n\nGiven that the author was told to take the break and then immediately faced a write-up without the manager considering her need for a bathroom break, maybe the manager's approach is part of the problem. However, from a policy standpoint, the cashier might have been in the wrong for not assisting the customer even during her break. \n\nBut the manager's policy of \"customer is always right\" might not account for the employee's basic needs. The cashier's actions might be understandable given the circumstances, but they still violated company policy. \n\nHmm. The answer could swing both ways. However, considering standard workplace policies, employees are usually expected to be accessible during work hours unless on a scheduled break. If the cashier was on a formal break, she might not be in the wrong, but if she was supposed to be on the floor and the break wasn't official, then she is. The manager's instruction to take a break suggests it was approved, but the location (in the store) might be an issue. \n\nI think the cashier is in the wrong because she was told to take a break, but even during breaks, she might be expected to handle customer inquiries if she's still on the premises. Alternatively, the manager's handling is poor, but according to policy, the cashier might have violated customer service expectations. So, the answer is A.\n"
