I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a cashier at a grocery store and is on probation. They had a busy morning when a coworker called in sick, and their manager was late in relieving them. So they didn't get a bathroom break and finally took a break when the manager told them to. Then a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which were clearly visible behind them. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude and for arguing when they explained they needed to use the bathroom.\n\nHmm. The cashier's main issue is that they were on break and didn't want to engage in a conversation they felt might be time-consuming. They had a valid reason for needing to use the bathroom. But the problem is that during their break, they were approached by a customer. Even if they're on break, they might still be expected to assist customers if needed. But the customer's question was straightforward and the product was right there, so maybe the cashier just needed to point it out quickly. However, the cashier's response of saying they were on break and walking away might be seen as rude, even if they were on break. \n\nOn the other hand, the manager's reaction seems harsh. The cashier was on break and had a legitimate reason for needing it. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when explaining their situation. The cashier might not be in the wrong here because they were following the manager's instruction to take a break and had a valid reason for needing it. However, the way they handled the customer's question could have been better. Instead of just saying they were on break, maybe they could have pointed the customer to the product quickly or suggested they look behind them. \n\nSo, the cashier might have a point, but maybe there's a better way to handle such situations. The manager's strictness and the written up for arguing could be an issue. But the cashier's actions, while understandable, might have been unprofessional in the eyes of the company. The key is whether the cashier was supposed to assist customers even during breaks. If the break was approved by the manager, then maybe the cashier is in the right. If not, then the cashier might be in the wrong. But the manager did tell them to take the break. \n\nIn the end, the cashier is in a tough spot. They needed a break for a valid reason and were on probation. The manager's handling of the situation might be the bigger issue here. However, from a company policy perspective, employees are usually expected to be helpful to customers even during breaks if necessary. So the cashier might be in the wrong for not assisting the customer, but the manager's strictness could also be a factor. I think the cashier is not entirely in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the manager's actions seem a bit harsh. So perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
