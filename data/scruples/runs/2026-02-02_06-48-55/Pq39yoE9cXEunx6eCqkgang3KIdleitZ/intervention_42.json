I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a cashier who was on break and told a customer they couldn't help because they were on break. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and the manager told them to take a 15-minute break. When the customer approached, the cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then reprimanded them for being rude and wrote them up. The cashier argues that sometimes simple questions turn into longer interactions and they needed to use the bathroom urgently.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the job. Typically, when on break, employees are not supposed to be working, but they might still be expected to assist customers if they're in the store area. However, if the cashier was explicitly told to take a break and the manager was aware, maybe they were excused from customer interactions during that time. But usually, even on break, employees might still need to be available or approachable unless told otherwise.\n\nThe cashier's action of walking away without helping could be seen as rude or unprofessional. Even if they were on break, the customer might need assistance, and the cashier might be expected to direct them to the help desk or another employee. However, the cashier might have a valid reason for needing the bathroom and wanting to take a break after a long shift. The manager's handling of the situation might also be questionable if the cashier was genuinely on break and the customer's request was simple.\n\nBut from a company policy perspective, employees are often expected to maintain a professional demeanor at all times, even on break. Telling a customer they're on break and walking away might not be the best approach. The cashier should have either asked the customer to wait until they could help or directed them to another resource. So, the cashier might be in the wrong for not handling the customer's request appropriately, even while on break. However, the manager's approach in writing them up for taking a necessary break could also be problematic if the break was properly taken as per the manager's instruction. The context of the probationary period and the manager's prior written up adds complexity.\n\nBalancing the need for the employee to take a break versus customer service expectations, I think the cashier did something unprofessional by not addressing the customer's request properly. Even if it's a simple question, the way they responded was dismissive. So the answer is A for the author being in the wrong.\n"
