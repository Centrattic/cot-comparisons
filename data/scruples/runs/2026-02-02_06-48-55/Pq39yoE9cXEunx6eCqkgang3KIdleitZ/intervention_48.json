I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store in a probationary period. They were handling the morning rush alone, couldn't go to the bathroom, and finally got a 15-minute break after their manager relieved them. While on the break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told them they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for rudeness and arguing when they explained.\n\nSo, the key points here are about workplace policies and customer service expectations. The cashier was on a break, which they were told to take, but the manager's instruction was to take a 15-minute break and come back. However, when a customer approached, the cashier didn't help, which might be against company policy. Even if they were on break, employees are often expected to assist customers if they're in the store. Especially in a grocery store, cashiers might be expected to help with general questions, not just at their registers.\n\nThe cashier's reasoning is that they didn't want to get into long conversations because they had had past issues with customers. But the situation here was a simple question that could have been answered quickly. The manager's response was harsh, but the company policy might prioritize customer service over breaks. Also, the cashier was in the store during their break, so maybe they didn't have to be at their register, but they still might be required to assist.\n\nThe cashier's need to use the restroom is understandable, but they were on a break specifically given to handle such needs. If they needed to use the restroom, they should have gone immediately instead of lingering in the store where they could be approached. Alternatively, maybe the manager should have relieved them earlier, but the cashier had the break time to manage their personal needs.\n\nIn terms of being rude, just saying they're on break might be considered unhelpful. The cashier could have directed the customer to a colleague or provided the information. Since they were the only cashier during the rush, maybe they should have known the store layout well enough to help. The manager's decision to write them up is strict, but the cashier's action might violate customer service protocols. So, the cashier is in the wrong for not assisting the customer despite being on a break. Answer A."
