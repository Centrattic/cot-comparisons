I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a cashier at a grocery store who got written up for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering her question.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone because another cashier was sick. They didn't get a break and finally got relief, then took a 15-minute break. While on the break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which were clearly visible nearby. The cashier told them they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and later for arguing when explaining the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here: The employee was on a break, which they had just been allowed to take after a long shift without bathroom breaks. The customer's question was simple and the answer was obvious. The cashier was trying to avoid a longer conversation to take care of their personal needs. However, the manager insists the customer is always right and wrote them up for not assisting. \n\nNow, considering workplace policies, breaks are usually for employees to rest or use the bathroom. If the employee is on a break, they're not supposed to be working. But when approached by a customer, even on break, they might be expected to help if they can. However, if the employee is clearly on a break (like stepping away from the register), maybe it's acceptable to decline. But some stores have strict policies where employees are expected to assist customers even during breaks unless they're in a designated break area.\n\nThe cashier's reasoning was they needed to go to the bathroom and didn't want a long conversation. The manager saw it as rudeness. The customer didn't look like she tried to find the product herself, which might add context. \n\nFrom a policy standpoint, the employee might have been expected to help, leading to them being in the wrong. But from the employee's perspective, they were on a break and had valid personal needs. The manager's handling seems harsh, but the question is whether the employee was wrong. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The employee was on a break, which is their right, but the manager's policy requires them to assist. However, the customer's question was simple and the answer obvious. The cashier's response was to state they were on break, which is technically correct. So maybe the manager overreacted, but the employee might still be in the wrong per company policy. But given the circumstances, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the employee is on a break, they shouldn't be working, but helping a customer isn't exactly work. But if they are in the break area, maybe they shouldn't be approached. The customer approached them in the store, so maybe the employee isn't obligated to help. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because the employee was on a break, had a valid reason to be on break (urgent personal needs), and the question was simple. The manager's policy is strict, but the situation shows the employee was following the manager's instruction to take a break. The manager's handling seems unfair.\n"
