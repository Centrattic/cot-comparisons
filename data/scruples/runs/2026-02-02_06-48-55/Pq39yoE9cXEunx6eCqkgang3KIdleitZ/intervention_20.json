I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a cashier who was on break but was approached by a customer asking about Cadbury Cream eggs. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away, leading to a write-up from the manager.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations of the workplace. The cashier was on a break given by the manager. If the manager specifically told them to take a break, then during that time, they might not be supposed to be working or assisting customers. However, sometimes in retail environments, even during breaks, employees might be expected to help if a customer needs something, especially if the store is busy. But in this case, the cashier was on a break after handling a busy morning shift and needed to use the restroom. The manager's instruction was to take a break, so maybe the cashier was following that order.\n\nHowever, the way the cashier responded to the customer could be an issue. Telling the customer they were on break and then walking away might come off as rude, even if the cashier was on break. The manager likely expects that if a customer approaches, even during a break, the employee should at least direct them to where the item might be, or inform them that they can't help but suggest where to look. The cashier's action of just walking away without providing any help could be seen as unprofessional or rude, hence the write-up. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was in a difficult situation: needing to use the restroom, being on a break, and dealing with a customer who might have been looking but not finding the item. The cashier's past experiences where simple questions led to long conversations might have made them hesitant. But the manager's policy is probably clear that during breaks, employees should not be engaged in work tasks, but maybe they should still assist in a minimal way.\n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude and then for arguing. The cashier explained their need to go to the bathroom, which might be a valid personal need, but the manager's perspective is that the company's policy takes precedence. The key here is whether the cashier's actions violated company policy. If the policy states that even on break, employees should assist customers, then the cashier was wrong. But if the policy allows for taking a break without interruptions, then the cashier might be in the right. However, the manager's reaction suggests that the policy expects some level of customer service even during breaks.\n\nIn many retail jobs, employees are expected to be available to help customers at all times unless they are on a specific task or in a non-visible break area. If the cashier was in the store area during their break, they might still be expected to help. So, the cashier might be in the wrong for not assisting the customer, even briefly. But the manager's handling of the situation, not considering the employee's need to use the restroom, might also be a factor. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the manager. \n\nConsidering all that, the cashier's refusal to help, even on break, if the company expects that, would make them in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
