Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were wrong to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The dad rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further. The daughter is upset and quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and appropriateness. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially during puberty. However, the parent's approach might be too strict or abrupt for a 12-year-old. The key here is the parent's reasoning: they mentioned it's inappropriate in front of her father. But in a family setting, some might argue that it's normal for kids to be in less clothing at home, especially in private spaces. However, once the child is a teenager, parents might want to establish different boundaries to prepare her for societal norms.\n\nThe parent's tone is direct, which could have hurt the daughter's feelings. It's important to consider the age and maturity level. A 12-year-old might not yet understand the societal expectations the parent is referring to. The parent could have explained the reasons more gently, perhaps discussing body autonomy, respect, and the transition into adulthood. \n\nThe father's reaction of rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation might have confused the daughter further. The parent bringing it up later suggests they're aware of the tension. The daughter's current silence indicates she's affected by the conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to teach their daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior around adults. It's a valid concern, especially if they want to instill values about body image and respect. However, the method of communication here might be the issue. Being direct without empathy could lead to a negative reaction. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a bit ambiguous. On one hand, they're addressing a reasonable concern. On the other hand, their approach might be too harsh for a 12-year-old and could damage the parent-child relationship. The answer might hinge on whether the parent's intent was to educate and set boundaries without causing emotional harm.\n"
