Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mother talking to her 12-year-old daughter about dressing more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The mother tells her to use a robe or cover up, explaining it's not appropriate in front of her father. The daughter seems upset, and the father avoids discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents, especially mothers, to guide children on modesty, especially as they enter puberty. The mother's concern might be about respect for the father's comfort and setting boundaries. However, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, so communication style might matter. The mother was direct, which could have hurt the daughter's feelings. The father's reaction of rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation might indicate he disagrees with the approach or doesn't see the issue.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's autonomy. At 12, she's developing her own sense of body image and privacy. The mother's intervention might be necessary for family norms, but the way she handled it could be too abrupt. The daughter's silence afterward suggests she's upset, so the method might need adjustment.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: There's no legal issue here. It's about parenting style. Some might say the mother is right to set boundaries, while others might say she's overstepping, especially if the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. The father's lack of engagement might be problematic because it leaves the daughter without a male perspective, but the mother might be acting in the father's interest.\n\nCultural differences: In some cultures, children can be more modest in mixed company, so the mother's actions could be seen as appropriate. In others, more leniency might be acceptable. Without knowing the specific culture, it's hard to say, but generally, setting boundaries is okay if done respectfully.\n\nThe key points are the daughter's age, the mother's intention to set appropriate boundaries, and the communication style. The mother isn't necessarily wrong in the content of her message, but maybe the delivery. However, given that the daughter is entering puberty, the mother's concern is valid. The answer might be that the mother is not in the wrong (B), but she could improve her approach. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the options are A or B. Since the question is whether the author is wrong, and the mother had a valid concern, even if the approach could be better, the answer is B.\n"
