Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showering. The parent explained it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it, and the daughter is being quiet.\n\nHmm. So, first, is the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries about modesty in the home is a common parental concern, especially during puberty. The parent is encouraging their daughter to dress more appropriately, which is a reasonable expectation. However, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and how the parent approached it might matter. The parent was direct and maybe hurt her feelings. But the parent's intention is about modesty and respect. The husband's reaction might indicate he doesn't agree with the approach, but that's between them.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue. They have a right to set standards for their household. However, maybe the way they communicated it could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for bringing it up. So, the answer would be B (No), because they're not wrong to encourage modesty, even if the delivery could be adjusted.\n"
