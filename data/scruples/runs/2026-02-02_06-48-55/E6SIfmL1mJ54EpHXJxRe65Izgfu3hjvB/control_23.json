Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around modesty in the home. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about clothing, especially as children become teenagers. The parent's intention here is to teach appropriate behavior and respect for privacy. However, the approach might be too direct, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The parent is being very direct, which could be harsh for a 12-year-old. The husband's reaction suggests he might disagree with the approach or the timing.\n\nBut then, the daughter's behavior might be typical for her age. At 12, some kids don't think about clothing as much, especially in a comfortable home environment. The parent is trying to prepare her for societal norms, which is a valid goal. However, the method of communication could be improved. Instead of being direct and maybe blunt, the parent could have had a more gentle conversation, explaining the reasons and perhaps involving the husband to present a united front. The fact that the husband is dismissive might lead to confusion for the daughter.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's concern is valid because the daughter is starting puberty, and setting boundaries is part of guiding her. But the way the message was delivered might have been hurtful. The daughter might feel criticized, especially if she's not aware that her behavior is an issue. The parent could have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging her feelings and explaining the reasons without making her feel shamed.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she's in a stage where she's developing her identity and might be sensitive to criticism. The parent's approach might have caused unnecessary emotional distress. The husband's reaction of rolling eyes and avoiding the topic might not help the daughter feel supported in understanding the new rules.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to set appropriate boundaries, the method used might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The parent isn't entirely in the wrong because the topic is important, but the approach could use improvement. However, since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the parent's actions were justified. Considering that setting boundaries is okay but the communication was poor, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong but could have done better. But the strict answer is whether they are in the wrong. Since the parent's intent was reasonable, but the delivery might be problematic, but not necessarily wrong. So answer B (No).\n"
