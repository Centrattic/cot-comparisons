Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent explained that it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have felt hurt, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries and teaching her about modesty. But maybe the approach was too direct, causing the daughter to feel upset. The father's reaction of eye-rolling and avoiding the topic might have confused the daughter.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, setting appropriate dress standards at home can be important for a teenager's understanding of body autonomy and social norms. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The parent might need to consider a more empathetic approach next time, ensuring the daughter feels respected while learning appropriate behavior. So, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer might be B, but with some nuance.\n"
