Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, and has been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel at home. The parent explained that it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider age-appropriate boundaries. At 12, a child is entering adolescence, and parents often set rules about modesty, especially in a co-ed household. It's common for parents to address clothing choices to teach respect for others and self-respect. The parent was trying to enforce modesty, which is a typical parenting approach. However, the way they communicated it might be an issue. They were direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The parent could have approached it more gently, considering the daughter's emotions during puberty.\n\nThe husband's reaction also plays a role. He didn't support the conversation and avoided further discussion, which might contribute to the daughter feeling confused or that the issue isn't important. But the main question is whether the parent was wrong in bringing it up. Enforcing modesty at home isn't necessarily wrong, especially with a pre-teen. However, the parent could have been more sensitive in their approach to avoid making the daughter feel criticized. \n\nSo, the parent's intention is valid, but the method might be lacking. But since the core issue is about setting appropriate boundaries, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
