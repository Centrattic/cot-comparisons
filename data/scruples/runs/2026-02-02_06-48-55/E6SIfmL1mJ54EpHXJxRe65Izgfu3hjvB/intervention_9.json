Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty and has been walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent's approach, and the daughter seems upset.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to set boundaries about appropriate behavior as the daughter grows. It's reasonable for parents to guide kids on modesty, especially when they're in a house with other adults. The daughter is 12, so she's entering adolescence, and discussing body image and privacy is part of parenting. However, the parent's approach was direct and might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the approach, which could create tension.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? The parent is trying to enforce a standard of modesty at home, which is a common parental concern. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings or explain it in a way that's age-appropriate. Also, the husband's reluctance to engage might indicate that the approach was too abrupt. The key here is balancing the need for boundaries with empathy and communication. The parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but the method could be improved. So the author isn't in the wrong entirely, but could handle it better. So answer B.\n"
