Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, maybe a towel for a long time after showers.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning is that the daughter is a young woman now and it's not appropriate to be half-dressed around her father. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation, rolling his eyes and avoiding the topic. The daughter is now quiet, which is unusual.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is it wrong to ask a child to dress more modestly at home? Well, parents have the right to set household rules about dress, especially for modesty and appropriateness. However, the approach matters. Being direct and causing hurt feelings could indicate that the parent didn't handle the conversation sensitively. The daughter is 12, so she's entering adolescence, a time when body image and privacy become more important. \n\nThe parent's concern is valid, but the way they addressed it might have been too harsh. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the approach either, which could create a lack of united front. The daughter's reaction (being pouty and quiet) shows she might feel criticized, which is common in adolescents when they feel their autonomy is threatened.\n\nBut the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the authority to set boundaries. However, the execution could have been better. The question is whether the parent was wrong. If the parent is in the wrong, it would be because of the manner, not the content. However, if the parent is not in the wrong, it's because they have the right to enforce modesty rules.\n\nIn similar cases, many would argue that the parent is not wrong for setting appropriate boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note that a softer approach could help.\n"
