Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, which often leads to changes in body image and behavior. She's wearing minimal clothing at home, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent finds this inappropriate now that the daughter is a young woman, so they direct her to cover up. The parent is direct, which may have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, making the parent feel isolated.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the parent's intervention and the approach taken. Legally, parents have the right to set boundaries about appropriate dress at home. However, the method used matters. Being direct and not allowing the daughter to explain might come off as harsh, especially during a sensitive time like puberty when a teenager is already dealing with body image issues.\n\nThe parent's justification is about respect and appropriateness. But the way they handled it could have been more considerate. Maybe using a calmer tone or explaining it as a matter of respect for both the daughter and the parent. Also, involving the husband in the conversation might have been necessary since he's part of the dynamic. Dismissing the daughter's feelings by being too direct could lead to resentment or a lack of communication in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is addressing a legitimate concern. It's common for parents to want to teach their children about modesty and appropriate clothing, especially as they become teenagers. The alternative is to ignore it, which might not be the best approach either. So the parent isn't entirely wrong in their intention but perhaps in the execution.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's approach might be too harsh, leading the daughter to feel hurt. The husband's reaction also suggests discomfort with the topic, which could affect the overall family dynamic. However, the parent isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for making the request, just perhaps for how they approached it. The question is whether the parent was wrong to say something. Since setting boundaries is reasonable, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the method could be improved. However, the user thinks the parent is in the wrong, so maybe leaning towards that. But I need to decide based on the options given.\n"
