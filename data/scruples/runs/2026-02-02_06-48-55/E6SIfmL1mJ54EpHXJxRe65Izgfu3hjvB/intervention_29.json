Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness since the daughter is entering puberty. The daughter was wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't engage much.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider the age. 12 is pretty young, but puberty can start earlier. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is common. But how the parent approached it might be an issue. The parent is direct, which is fine, but maybe the way it was said made the daughter feel embarrassed or hurt. The parent didn't explain the reasoning well, just told her it's inappropriate. The daughter was confused and asked why, and the parent's answer might not have been age-appropriate or clear. Also, the husband's reaction was to ignore it, which might have left the daughter feeling unsupported.\n\nNow, the parent's intention is to teach modesty and set boundaries. But at 12, communication should be gentle and educational. If the parent comes off as critical or makes the child feel ashamed, that's a problem. The daughter's reaction suggests she felt hurt, so maybe the parent was too harsh. However, the parent isn't entirely wrong to address the behavior; it's just the approach that's questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that parents should set such boundaries early, especially regarding body autonomy and respect. The parent is trying to prepare the daughter for societal norms. But the key here is the method and the emotional impact. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings and was dismissive when the husband didn't engage. The daughter's silence afterward indicates she's upset, which might mean the parent's approach was too abrupt.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The parent is not entirely wrong because they have a valid concern about modesty and setting boundaries. However, the way they addressed it could be improved. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the parent had a legitimate reason, but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe it's A (Yes) because the parent's approach was hurtful and didn't consider the child's feelings.\n\nWait, in some cultures or contexts, teaching modesty is important. But at 12, children are still learning, and the approach should be understanding. The parent's directness without explaining the reasoning properly could be seen as wrong. Also, the daughter's behavior might be normal for her age, and the parent is imposing adult expectations too soon. So maybe the parent is in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle it sensitively. But I'm a bit torn because the parent's intention is reasonable but the execution is poor. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not just the approach. So if the parent's action is justified but the method is poor, maybe they aren't in the wrong overall. But if the action itself is wrong, then A. The parent is teaching boundaries, which is okay, but could have been more tactful. So perhaps the answer is B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the parent is in the right to set boundaries but the way they did it was wrong. The question is if they're in the wrong for the action. Since the action (telling the daughter to cover up) is reasonable, the parent isn't in the wrong. But the tone and approach are the issue. So the answer would be B. But some might argue that the parent is in the wrong for not respecting the child's autonomy. However, given that the parent is trying to teach appropriateness, the answer is likely B.\n"
