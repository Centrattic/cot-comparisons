Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parent is talking about their 12-year-old daughter who's going through puberty. She's been wearing a tank top and underwear around the house and sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent asked her to cover up more, explaining that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband rolled his eyes and wanted to drop the conversation. The parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. 12 years old is the start of puberty for many girls, so body changes are happening. Parents often have discussions about modesty and appropriate dress, especially when children are becoming teenagers. The parent is concerned about the daughter's behavior in the house, which is a private setting but still involves the father being present. \n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the daughter's attire in front of her father and the parent's approach. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is now a young woman, so modesty matters more. The parent is direct, which might have upset the daughter, but is the action itself wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, discussing body autonomy and modesty with children as they enter puberty is a normal part of parenting. However, the way the conversation was handled might be part of the issue. The daughter's reaction suggests she felt hurt, possibly because the parent didn't consider her feelings or the approach was too abrupt. Also, the husband's reaction indicates he might not support the same approach or thinks it's not necessary to address it so directly.\n\nBut the core question is whether the parent was wrong to set a boundary. If the parent is encouraging their daughter to cover up in front of her father to maintain appropriate boundaries, that's a reasonable action. However, the method could be improved. Maybe the parent should have approached the conversation more gently, considering the daughter's feelings and explaining the reasons in a way that includes the daughter's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern is valid. It's important to teach children about appropriate body exposure and respect for others' comfort levels. However, the parent might not be wrong in the action but could have handled the conversation better. The daughter's reaction and the husband's indifference might indicate that the parent's approach wasn't the best, but the intent is good.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the parent is trying to enforce a boundary for appropriate behavior, which is reasonable. The mistake might be in how they communicated it, leading to hurt feelings, but the action itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could improve their approach.\n"
