Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's been wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showers. The parent suggested using a robe instead, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband dismissed it, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty at home. But the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and puberty can start around there. The parent's concern is about appropriate dress around a parent of the opposite sex. However, the daughter is in her own home, and the situation is about family privacy. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have been effective but maybe harsh. The daughter's reaction suggests she felt upset, so communication style is a factor. The husband's reaction is also part of the issue\u2014avoiding the conversation when it's important. But the main question is whether the parent was wrong.\n\nThe parent's intent is to teach modesty and respect for family boundaries. However, the method might not have been the best. The daughter might not have realized that her actions were inappropriate, especially at her age. The parent's explanation is reasonable, but the way it was delivered could have caused hurt. So, was the parent wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, setting boundaries is important. On the other, the communication method and considering the child's feelings matters. The key is whether the parent's action was justified. Since the parent's intention is to guide the daughter appropriately, but the approach might have been too direct without considering the emotional impact. However, the parent isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. So probably answer B (No), because the parent is not in the wrong, but the approach could be better. But need to check if there's a cultural expectation here. In some places, it's common for parents to set such rules. So overall, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
