Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the parent is asking if they were right to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty, wears a tank top and underwear, or a towel for long periods after showering. The parent explained that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and parenting approaches. Puberty is a time when kids' bodies change, and parents often set boundaries about modesty. The parent might be trying to teach her about appropriate behavior. However, the way they approached it could be an issue if it was harsh or made the daughter feel criticized. The parent is direct, which can be good for clear communication, but if it hurt the daughter's feelings, maybe they could have been more empathetic.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014rolling eyes and avoiding the topic\u2014might indicate differing views on how to handle this. The daughter being quiet now suggests she's upset. The question is whether the parent was wrong in the content of the message or the way it was delivered. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to set household rules. Culturally, there's a range of what's considered appropriate. Some might see the parent's action as necessary for the daughter's future social norms, while others might think it's too early or restrictive. The key is whether the parent's action was reasonable given the situation. Since the daughter is 12, starting to navigate puberty, setting boundaries is common. However, the parent should consider the child's feelings and the approach taken. The answer likely isn't in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. Maybe the parent isn't in the wrong for the content but could have handled it better. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
