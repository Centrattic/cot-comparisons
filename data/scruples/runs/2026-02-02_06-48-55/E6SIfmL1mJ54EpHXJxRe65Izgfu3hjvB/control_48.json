Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't engage, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms and age-appropriate boundaries. At 12, kids are entering puberty, so body image and modesty can be sensitive topics. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. But the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted. However, in many families, parents do set rules about appropriate dress in the home, especially to respect others' comfort. The parent's reasoning about her being a young woman and the father's presence seems valid. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. Maybe they could have approached it more gently, but the intention is about setting appropriate boundaries. The husband's reaction is dismissive, which might add to the tension. But the main question is about the parent's right to set this expectation. \n\nIs the parent wrong? Probably not. They're addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and respecting the father. However, the method could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since there's no clear harm beyond possible emotional upset, and the parent's intentions are good, the answer is likely B (No). The parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries, even if the approach could be softened.\n"
