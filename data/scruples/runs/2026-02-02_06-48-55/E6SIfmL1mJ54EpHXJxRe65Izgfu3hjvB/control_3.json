Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel, and the parent suggested using a robe. The parent was direct, maybe hurt the daughter's feelings, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the appropriateness of the parent's actions. At 12, children are entering adolescence, and parents might start setting boundaries around modesty. The parent is concerned about the daughter being half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. That seems like a reasonable concern from a parent's perspective, promoting modesty and respect.\n\nBut then there's the way the parent approached it. Being very direct might have come across as harsh, especially if the daughter felt her feelings were hurt. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings, which is important during puberty when kids are sensitive. Also, the husband's reaction might indicate that he didn't support the approach, leading to the parent dropping the discussion.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the content of the message is about setting a boundary, which is a parent's role. However, the method could be better. The parent should have approached it with more empathy, perhaps explaining the reasoning in a way that respects the daughter's growing autonomy. The fact that the daughter became quiet and pouty suggests that the approach might have been too abrupt or not age-appropriate for communication.\n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but the way they handled the conversation might have been inappropriate. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the parent's intention was to guide the daughter towards appropriate dress and the content of the message is valid, then maybe the parent isn't wrong. But the approach could be improved. The answer depends on whether the content or the approach is being judged here.\n\nSince the question is about being in the wrong, and the parent's intention is to set a reasonable boundary, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the execution could be better. The parent isn't wrong for the content of the message but could have handled the delivery with more consideration for the daughter's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
