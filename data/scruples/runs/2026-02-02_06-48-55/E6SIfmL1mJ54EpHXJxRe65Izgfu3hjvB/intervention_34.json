Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, leading the author to question if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, which is around the start of puberty. Parents often have to set boundaries about modesty, especially as children grow. The parent's intention seems to be about appropriateness and respecting her daughter's developing body. But maybe the approach could be better? The parent is described as very direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. Also, the husband's reaction suggests there might be differing opinions in the household.\n\nIs it wrong for the parent to set such boundaries? On one hand, it's a parent's responsibility to guide their child about appropriate behavior and clothing, even at home. On the other hand, being too strict or not explaining things well can lead to resentment. The daughter's response (pouting, being quiet) indicates she might feel her autonomy is being limited. But 12 years old is still young, so the parent's role is to guide, not necessarily to give full autonomy.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of her father. That's a common concern. However, maybe the parent didn't consider the daughter's perspective or the cultural context of modesty at home. Some families are more relaxed about what kids wear at home. The parent's approach might be overly strict, especially if the daughter is still a child and not a \"young woman\" in the sense of needing to dress more formally at home. Also, the parent's directness might have been harsher than necessary, leading to the daughter's hurt feelings.\n\nThe husband's nonchalant reaction could imply that the parent overreacted, but we don't know the family's usual dynamics. The parent might have valid concerns but could have handled the conversation more sensitively. So, is the parent in the wrong? If the parent was just setting reasonable boundaries, then no. But if the parent was being overly strict without considering the daughter's age and the home environment, then maybe yes. The key points are the daughter's age, the context of being at home, and the approach taken.\n\nIn many cultures, children are allowed to wear whatever they want at home unless it's inappropriate for public. A towel or underwear at home is common, especially after a shower. The parent might be applying a standard that's not typical for home settings, which could be unreasonable. So maybe the parent is overstepping by dictating clothing at home. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the parent is concerned about the child's modesty and future, but the approach was too harsh, it's a mix. But since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable. If the parent is just asking for more coverage at home, maybe that's imposing unnecessary modesty standards without good reason. So I think the parent is in the wrong here, answer A.\n"
