Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty, and the parent is concerned about her walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained it's not appropriate because she's a young woman now. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided talking about it, leading to the daughter being quiet.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the daughter matures. But the approach might have been too direct without considering her feelings. At 12, kids are sensitive about their bodies and autonomy. The parent's bluntness might have hurt the daughter's feelings, as suggested by the daughter's pouting and subsequent silence. The father's reaction of rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation might have confused the child further, making her feel unsupported.\n\nWhile the parent isn't entirely wrong to address the behavior, the method could be improved. Maybe approaching it with more empathy, discussing privacy and modesty in a way that respects her growing independence, and involving the husband to present a united front would have been better. The parent's directness might have been harsh for the situation, so there's room to say they're partly in the wrong. However, the core issue of setting appropriate boundaries isn't wrong. So, the answer might be a mix, but since the options are A or B, leaning towards A because the parent's approach could be seen as overstepping without sufficient sensitivity.\n"
