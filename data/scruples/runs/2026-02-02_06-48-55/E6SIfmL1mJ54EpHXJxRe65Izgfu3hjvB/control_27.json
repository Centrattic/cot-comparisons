Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is going through puberty, which is a common time for such discussions.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries and teaching the daughter about appropriate clothing, especially considering their father's presence. The parent is direct, which might have upset the daughter, but their concern is understandable. They also mention the husband's reaction, which might indicate some tension in the household about how to handle such issues.\n\nThe key points here are: the child's age, the parent's approach, and the context of puberty. At 12, a child is entering adolescence, so discussions about body privacy and modesty are part of growing up. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to wear specific clothes but is suggesting more coverage, which is reasonable. However, the parent's directness might have been harsh, leading to the daughter's hurt feelings. The husband's lack of support might have compounded the issue, but the question is about the parent's actions alone.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent is trying to guide their child through a natural developmental stage. While the approach could be more gentle, the underlying intent isn't wrong. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I should also check if there's any aspect where the parent overstepped. Since they're discussing appropriate behavior within the home and the child is at an age where such guidance is necessary, the parent's actions are justified. The daughter's reaction might be due to sensitivity during this time, but the parent isn't wrong for addressing it.\n"
