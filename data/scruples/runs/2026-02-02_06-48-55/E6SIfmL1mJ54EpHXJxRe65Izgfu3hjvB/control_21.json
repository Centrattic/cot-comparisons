Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and in puberty, so her body is changing. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, maybe a towel after showering. The parent thinks it's not appropriate for her to walk around like that now that she's a young woman. They suggested using a robe instead. The daughter was hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it.\n\nHmm. The parent's concern is about modesty and setting boundaries as the daughter becomes a young woman. But is that the right approach? At 12, kids are still developing their understanding of social norms. The parent's directness might have been too harsh, especially if the daughter felt her feelings were hurt. Also, the husband's reaction suggests maybe he didn't think it was a big deal, which could create tension.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, modesty at home is important, but in others, kids might have more freedom. The key here is the parent's reasoning. They mentioned that the daughter is a young woman now, implying a shift in how she should present herself. But is it necessary to enforce such strict dress codes at home?\n\nAlso, the parent didn't consider the daughter's perspective. Maybe the daughter feels her body and choices are her own. The parent might have approached it without enough empathy, leading to the daughter's pouting. The husband's avoidance could mean he doesn't see the issue, so the parent might be overstepping.\n\nBut on the other hand, parents do have a role in guiding their children's behavior. However, the way it was handled\u2014being very direct and not considering the daughter's feelings\u2014might be the problem. The parent didn't explain the reasoning clearly or validate the daughter's feelings. Instead, they gave a blunt \"it's not appropriate\" without context, which could feel dismissive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The parent's intention might be good, but the approach was too harsh and lacked empathy. The daughter's reaction shows that the message wasn't delivered in a supportive way. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if the concern is valid.\n"
