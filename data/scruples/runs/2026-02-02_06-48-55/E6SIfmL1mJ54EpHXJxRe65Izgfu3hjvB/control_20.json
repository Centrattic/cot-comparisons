Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's in the house. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, and sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not appropriate in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt, the husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parental responsibilities. At 12, puberty is starting, so body changes are happening. Parents often set boundaries about modesty. The parent's intention seems to be about respect and appropriateness in the home, especially around the father. However, the daughter might feel her autonomy is invaded, especially if she's used to more freedom. The parent's directness could be seen as necessary for teaching boundaries, but the approach might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree or thinks it's not a big deal, which could create tension. \n\nBut is the parent wrong? In many cultures, parents do set rules about dress and modesty in the home. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriate behavior. However, the daughter's age and the parent's approach need to be considered. Maybe the parent should have had a more open conversation rather than being direct. But the parent also has a right to set household rules. The key points are: appropriateness in the home, the daughter's feelings, and the parent's right to teach boundaries. \n\nThe answer likely depends on context. Since the parent is trying to guide the daughter through puberty with appropriate behavior, they might not be in the wrong. However, the method of communication could be improved. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent's actions are about setting reasonable expectations for a young teenager, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
