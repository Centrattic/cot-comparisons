Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent of a 12-year-old daughter who's going through puberty. The daughter often wears a tank top and underwear at home, and even a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it. The parent is asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The daughter is 12, so early puberty. Parents often set boundaries about appropriate dress at home. The parent is trying to address a behavior that's becoming a habit. The parent's approach was direct, maybe a bit abrupt, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the parent's approach, but that's not the main issue here.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong for setting a boundary? Probably not. It's common for parents to guide children on modesty, especially as they become teenagers. However, the way it was handled could be a problem. The parent was direct, which might have come off as harsh. The daughter's feelings were hurt, which indicates the approach might need to be more empathetic. But the intent was to set a reasonable boundary, which is not wrong in itself.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and appropriate behavior at home. The method could be improved, but the act of setting the boundary isn't wrong."
