Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned that the house is warm, and the daughter wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter might be hurt, the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's actions are reasonable. The parent is setting boundaries about appropriate dress at home, especially regarding modesty and co-parenting with her father. It's common for parents to address such issues as children enter puberty. The parent's approach was direct, which might have been harsh, but the intent is about teaching modesty and respect. \n\nHowever, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and the parent's way of explaining might have been too abrupt. The husband's reaction might indicate he disagrees or doesn't want to get involved. The parent might have overstepped if they were too harsh, but the situation is about setting appropriate expectations.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent's intention is to guide their daughter, which is part of parenting. But the method might be questionable. The key is whether the parent's approach was age-appropriate and respectful. Since the daughter is in a transitional phase, the parent's directness could be seen as necessary, but maybe the tone could have been softer. However, the question is if the parent is in the wrong. I think the parent isn't in the wrong because it's a reasonable concern for a daughter's modesty, but could have handled it better. So answer B (No).\n"
