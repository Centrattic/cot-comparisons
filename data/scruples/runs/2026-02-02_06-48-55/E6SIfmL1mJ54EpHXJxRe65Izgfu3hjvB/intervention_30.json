Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so body changes are happening. The parent mentioned the house is warm, and the daughter wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and typical parenting practices. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty, especially as children enter puberty. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The key points are: the daughter is 12, which is a time when they become more aware of their bodies and may resist parental control over modesty. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of the father, which could be about maintaining boundaries as the child becomes an adolescent.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, they are trying to teach modesty and appropriate behavior, which is a valid concern. However, the way they communicated it might be too abrupt, not considering the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests possible differing opinions on how to handle it. Also, the daughter's response (being quiet) indicates she might be upset. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't wrong for setting a boundary. It's a reasonable concern for a 12-year-old to start dressing more appropriately, especially around a parent of the opposite gender. The issue might be the method rather than the message. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more sensitively. The question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because setting such boundaries is standard, even if the delivery could be improved. The parent is addressing a developmental milestone appropriately, even if the communication could use a more empathetic approach.\n"
