Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent explains that the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent gave a direct explanation about appropriateness, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation, which added tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, so body image is important. Parents might want to guide their kids on modesty, especially regarding the parent of the opposite sex. The parent's intention is to set boundaries, which is a common parental role. However, the approach was direct and maybe harsh, leading to the daughter being upset. The parent should have considered her feelings and maybe had a more gentle conversation. Also, the husband's reaction suggests there was no consensus on how to handle it, which could have added confusion for the daughter. \n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent's intention was to address an issue that could be sensitive. However, the method might be problematic. The daughter is in a vulnerable age, and being told off in front of the father might have embarrassed her. The parent might need to approach such topics with more empathy, considering the child's emotional state during puberty. \n\nOn the other hand, guiding a child on appropriate dress in the house, especially regarding modesty around a parent, is a valid concern. The parent isn't being cruel, just direct. However, the daughter's reaction shows the conversation might have been too blunt. The key here is whether the parent overstepped or if the approach was just a communication style. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's intention wasn't malicious, but the method could be improved. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better handling. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but the parent should reflect on their approach for future interactions.\n"
