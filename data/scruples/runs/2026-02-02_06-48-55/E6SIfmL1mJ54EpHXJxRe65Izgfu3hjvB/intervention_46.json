Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel for long periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They mentioned the house is warm, so maybe the daughter is comfortable, but the parent is concerned about appropriateness, especially since the daughter is becoming a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have upset the daughter. The husband's reaction was dismissive, not supporting the parent's approach.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural norms. In some families, modesty is emphasized from an early age, especially around male family members. The parent might be trying to instill values. However, at 12, the daughter is in a sensitive age where body image and autonomy are developing. The parent's approach could be seen as necessary for teaching boundaries, but the way it was delivered might have been harsh, leading to the daughter being upset.\n\nAlternative perspectives: Some might argue the parent has a right to set household rules for appropriateness. Others might say that a 12-year-old has the right to comfort at home, and the parent's reaction is overly strict, affecting the daughter's self-esteem. Also, the husband's lack of support could be a factor in the daughter feeling conflicted.\n\nI think the key points are the parent's intent versus the method. The parent isn't wrong in wanting to set boundaries, but the direct approach and the daughter's reaction suggest that the method could be improved. So the parent isn't entirely in the wrong (B), but could have handled it more sensitively. The answer should be B.\n"
