Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, and a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter is now quieter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of setting boundaries around modesty at home, especially with a child entering puberty. The parent's concern is about the daughter's body changes and the father being present. The parent is direct, which might have upset the daughter. But is the parent wrong for addressing this? \n\nIn many cultures, parents do set rules about appropriate clothing at home, especially as children grow up. However, a 12-year-old might not yet understand the need for such boundaries, so the approach matters. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriateness, which is valid. But maybe the way they communicated it could be improved. The fact that the husband didn't support the conversation might affect the daughter's perception. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't being abusive or overstepping by encouraging modesty. The daughter's reaction is understandable, but the parent's intention seems to be about teaching appropriate behavior. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication style. The parent isn't wrong, but could handle it more sensitively.\n"
