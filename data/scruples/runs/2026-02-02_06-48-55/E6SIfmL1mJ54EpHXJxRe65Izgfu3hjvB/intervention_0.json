Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so body changes are happening. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-naked in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nHmm. The parent's intentions are probably good, wanting to teach modesty and set boundaries. But 12 is a young age, and how the parent approached it might be too direct or harsh, especially if it hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he thought it wasn't a big deal, so there's a lack of support. The parent might have been too strict without considering the daughter's feelings or explaining more. Also, the daughter is in a sensitive age where body image is important. So maybe the parent is right in the need to set boundaries but wrong in the way they communicated it. Alternatively, maybe it's reasonable to talk about modesty at home, but the parent should have handled it more gently. I'm leaning towards the author being in the right because they are setting appropriate expectations, but perhaps the approach could have been softer. Wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the situation. The key factors are the parent's intent to guide the daughter towards modesty, the daughter's age and puberty, and the parent's communication style. The parent isn't wrong for trying to address appropriate dress, but maybe the way they did it could have been better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the parent's main point is valid (teaching modesty), then maybe they're not wrong. But if the approach was unkind or excessive, maybe they are. The daughter walking around in underwear and a towel for hours could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the father is present. So the parent's concern is valid. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the parent is too strict for a 12-year-old, but that's subjective. In many cultures, it's common to dress modestly at home regardless of age. So the parent's stance is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
