Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, which brings about body changes. The parent mentions she's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-naked in front of her father, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband didn't support the parent and avoided the conversation, leading to the daughter being quiet.\n\nNow, the user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Is there a clear right or wrong here? Let's consider cultural norms. In many societies, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially as kids enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach her about appropriate dress, even at home. However, the approach was direct and possibly hurtful. The parent might not have considered the daughter's feelings, leading to her being upset. The husband's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he didn't support the parent's method.\n\nBut the key question is whether the parent was wrong. The parent's intention is to set a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. The daughter is 12, which is a sensitive age. The parent could have approached it more gently, explaining the reasoning and checking in on her feelings. The fact that the husband dismissed the conversation might have left the parent feeling isolated, but that's their marital issue.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but the approach could have been better. However, the user and the parent are both thinking the parent is in the wrong. But given that the parent is trying to set reasonable boundaries for a young girl in puberty, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but the delivery was poor. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the action is reasonable (teaching modesty), but the method was harsh, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, some might argue that the parent overstepped. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The parent's intention is good, but the method could use improvement. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
