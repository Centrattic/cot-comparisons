Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent explains that the daughter is going through puberty and has been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent gave her a robe to use instead, explaining it's inappropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt by the directness, and the husband avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's considered appropriate for parents to guide their children on modesty, especially as they enter puberty. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is a common parenting role. However, the daughter is 12, which is a transitional age. She's becoming aware of her body and may feel self-conscious. The parent's approach was direct, which might have been harsh, but the intent was to teach modesty.\n\nThe daughter's reaction suggests that the parent's communication might have been too blunt, leading to hurt feelings. The parent could have approached it differently, perhaps with more empathy, explaining the reasons without making the daughter feel ashamed. However, the parent is not wrong for wanting to set boundaries. \n\nThe husband's reaction of rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation could indicate a lack of support for the parent's approach, but that's a different issue. The main question is about the parent's actions. Since the parent's intention was to guide the daughter towards appropriate behavior, and the concern is valid (modesty in front of the father), the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the method could be improved. But since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer is more likely B (No). The parent isn't wrong for addressing the issue, but could have handled it more sensitively.\n"
