Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's in the house. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent says the house is warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing appropriately, explaining it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They're trying to set boundaries about modesty and appropriate behavior, especially regarding the daughter's father. The parent is being direct, which might have come off as harsh, but the motivation seems to be about teaching appropriateness as the daughter becomes a young woman. However, the parent's approach might have been too abrupt or not sensitive enough to the daughter's feelings. The daughter is 12, so she's starting puberty, and this is a time when children might be more self-conscious or sensitive. The parent didn't consider the daughter's perspective or feelings, leading to a hurt reaction.\n\nThe parent's husband didn't support the approach, avoiding the conversation, which might indicate that the parent's method isn't the most effective. The key issue here is whether the parent overstepped or was justified. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty, especially regarding co-parents. However, the way it was communicated could be problematic. The parent didn't offer alternatives (like specific clothing options) or explain in a way that the daughter could understand without feeling criticized. \n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong in terms of the intention, but the execution could be better. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If being in the wrong is about the action itself, then maybe not, as setting appropriate boundaries is part of parenting. But if it's about how it was handled, leading to hurt feelings and lack of support from the husband, maybe the parent's approach was flawed. However, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for having the conversation. The main issue is communication style rather than the content of the message. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. The parent is trying to prepare the daughter for societal norms and respect, which is reasonable. The problem is the delivery, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
