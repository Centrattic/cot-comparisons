Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours after showers. The parent explained it's not appropriate around her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and changed the subject. The daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially as children grow. But the daughter is 12, entering puberty, so her body changes are normal. However, walking around the house in minimal clothing might be seen as inappropriate depending on family values.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct and may have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he didn't support the parent's approach, leading to a conflict. The parent's reasoning is about respecting boundaries and the daughter's new role as a young woman. But the parent could have communicated more compassionately instead of being direct and causing a pout.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? On one hand, setting boundaries is important for a child's development and understanding of appropriate behavior. On the other hand, the method might have been too harsh without considering the daughter's feelings. The parent might have been right to address the behavior but could have handled it more gently. The husband's lack of support complicates things, but that's more about their relationship than the daughter's situation.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the parent's intention was to protect the daughter's modesty and teach respect, maybe not. But the approach might have been too blunt. However, given the age and the parent's role in guiding the child, the parent might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because establishing boundaries is part of parenting, even if the method could be improved.\n"
