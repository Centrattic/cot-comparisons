Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father. The husband didn't support the parent, which might have affected the daughter's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around children's modesty at home. At 12, kids are entering puberty, so parents might feel it's time to set boundaries. However, the daughter is in her own home, and some might argue that she should have the freedom to dress comfortably. But then, there's the aspect of being a young woman and appropriate behavior in front of her father. \n\nNext, the parent's approach. They were direct, which the daughter might find harsh, especially if she's sensitive. The parent's explanation is about appropriateness, but maybe the daughter felt her autonomy was being restricted. The parent's husband didn't back them up, leading the daughter to feel like the parent is being overbearing without support. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction: being pouty and quiet. That shows she might be upset. The parent's directness could be causing emotional distress. But it's also a reasonable concern for the parent to address. \n\nI should check if there's a cultural or societal expectation that supports the parent's actions. In many cultures, parents set guidelines for their children's clothing at home, especially as they grow older. However, other perspectives might say that children should be allowed to be comfortable in their own space. \n\nThe key points are: the daughter's age, the parent's explanation, the husband's non-support, and the daughter's emotional response. The parent's intention was to guide their daughter towards appropriate behavior, but the method might have been too abrupt. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a bit situational. If the daughter is in a private setting and the parent is trying to enforce rules that the other parent doesn't agree with, maybe the parent should have handled it more gently. But overall, setting boundaries about modesty isn't necessarily wrong. However, the husband's reaction might be contributing to the daughter's confusion. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because it's common for parents to set such guidelines as kids enter puberty. However, the parent could have been more empathetic in their approach. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and as long as the parent is acting in the child's best interest, even if the method is direct, they aren't wrong. The husband's lack of support might be an issue, but that's separate from the parent's initial action.\n"
