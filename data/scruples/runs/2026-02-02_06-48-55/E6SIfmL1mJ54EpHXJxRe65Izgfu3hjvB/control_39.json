Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is walking around in tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and what's considered appropriate for a 12-year-old. At 12, kids are going through puberty, so body changes are happening. But in many cultures, it's common for children, even as they get older, to be more comfortable in their own homes. However, as they become teenagers, parents might start setting boundaries about modesty, especially when there are opposite-sex parents present.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about modesty and transitioning into being a young woman. They were direct, and the daughter's feelings might have been hurt. The husband dismissed the conversation, which could indicate differing views on how to handle it. The daughter's reaction (being quiet) suggests she was upset.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some might argue that the parent is right to set boundaries to respect the father's comfort and to teach the daughter about appropriate behavior. Others might say that a 12-year-old is still a child and shouldn't be restricted in her own home, especially if it's not affecting others negatively. The parent's tone being direct might have hurt the daughter, but the intent is about modesty and respect.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they're trying to guide their daughter into appropriate behavior as she grows. However, the approach could have been more sensitive. But the question is whether they're wrong, not whether their method was perfect. So the answer is B (No).\n"
