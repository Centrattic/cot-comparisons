Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, and has started walking around in just a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent is concerned about appropriateness, especially around the father, and told her to use a robe or cover up. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter has been quiet.\n\nThe parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The key points here are the parent's intentions versus the daughter's reaction. The parent's reason is about modesty and the daughter being a young woman. But at 12, kids are in puberty, and their bodies are changing, so this is a common concern.\n\nHowever, how the parent approached it might be an issue. Being direct can sometimes be too harsh, especially if the child isn't used to that style of communication. The daughter might feel embarrassed or criticized, which led to her being pouty. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes) didn't help, and the parent dropped the issue with him, which might have left the daughter confused or unsupported.\n\nBut the core question is whether the parent was wrong to bring up the topic. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty, even at home. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to dress in a certain way but is suggesting more coverage. The issue isn't about public exposure but within the home, which is a common parental concern when children reach puberty.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's approach might have been too abrupt. Maybe a more gentle discussion, explaining the reasons without making the daughter feel shamed would have been better. The daughter's reaction suggests she felt hurt, so the method might have been as important as the message.\n\nAnother angle: at 12, the daughter is developing her sense of autonomy. The parent's intervention could be seen as necessary for teaching social norms, but it's also important to respect the child's growing independence. The balance between guidance and respect for the child's feelings is crucial here.\n\nThe husband's non-supportive reaction complicates things. The parent might have needed a united front, but since the husband didn't engage, the daughter might have felt her parent's side wasn't backed, leading to confusion.\n\nSo, was the parent wrong? If the parent had a valid concern about modesty and approached it with empathy, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they communicated it caused hurt feelings. Maybe the parent's approach was too harsh, making them at least partially wrong. Alternatively, the parent's intentions were good, so they're not in the wrong, but their method could be improved.\n\nIn many cases, experts suggest that open communication is key. Parents should explain reasons without shaming. Here, the parent's directness might have been the problem, not the topic itself. So the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong for the topic but could have handled it better. But the user's question is whether the parent is in the wrong, not whether their approach was perfect.\n\nConsidering all that, the parent's concern is valid, but the execution might have been flawed. However, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for bringing it up. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that the approach could use improvement. Alternatively, the parent might be in the wrong if the approach was too harsh, making them the A choice.\n\nHmm. I think the key is that the parent's intention was to teach modesty, which is acceptable, but the way they did it hurt the daughter's feelings. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the action was justified. Since parents have the right to set such boundaries, the parent isn't in the wrong for the conversation itself, but perhaps the method. Since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the concern is legitimate and the parent's action is within their parental rights, even if the delivery could be better.\n"
