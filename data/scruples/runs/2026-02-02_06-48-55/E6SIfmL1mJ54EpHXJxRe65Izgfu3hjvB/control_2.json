Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel after showers. The parent suggested using a robe, explaining it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, the husband didn't support the conversation. The question is if the parent was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms around body autonomy and parental guidance. At 12, kids are entering puberty and learning about modesty. Parents often set boundaries about appropriate dress, even at home. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter is still a child, so expecting her to use a robe or dress more modestly at home is reasonable for some families. But the parent's communication style could be an issue. The husband's reaction might indicate differing views on how to handle this. \n\nAlso, considering modern parenting trends, some might argue that a 12-year-old should have some autonomy, but others believe parents have authority. The key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to wear specific clothes, just suggesting it's not appropriate. The daughter's reaction suggests the parent could have been more sensitive. However, the parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as setting reasonable boundaries is part of parenting. But maybe there's a nuance. The parent's approach was direct and caused hurt feelings, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The husband's lack of support is another factor, but the question is about the parent's rightness. So I think the answer is B.\n"
