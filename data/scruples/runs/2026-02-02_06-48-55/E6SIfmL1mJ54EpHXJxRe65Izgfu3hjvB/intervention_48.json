Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided discussing it further.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries and teaching modesty. At 12, kids are entering adolescence, and parents often discuss appropriate behavior and clothing. The parent's argument is about respect and appropriateness, which is a common concern. However, the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted. \n\nThe parent is direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the topic) could indicate differing views on how to handle this. The key question is whether the parent overstepped. \n\nIn many cultures, parents do have a role in guiding children on modesty and appropriate dress, especially in mixed-gender settings. But the approach matters. Being direct is okay, but if it's done in a way that makes the child feel shamed or misunderstood, that's problematic. The parent might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries but could have handled it more sensitively. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she's in a stage where body image and self-esteem are developing. The parent's comment about her being a \"young woman\" might come across as focusing on her changing body in a way that could be uncomfortable. \n\nThe husband's lack of support might indicate that the parent's approach wasn't discussed in advance, leading to a lack of unified parenting. However, the parent still had the right to set this boundary, even if the execution could be improved. \n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Probably not. They're trying to teach appropriate behavior. However, the method could be better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since their intention is to set a reasonable boundary for a 12-year-old, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The parent's actions are justified, though the approach could be more empathetic.\n"
