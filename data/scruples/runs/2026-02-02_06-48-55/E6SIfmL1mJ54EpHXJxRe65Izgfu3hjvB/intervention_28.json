Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent is direct in their approach, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't engage in the discussion, and the daughter became quiet afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's request. The parent is concerned about the daughter's modesty, especially around her father. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about dress, especially as children become teenagers. However, the approach taken here is important. The parent was direct, which might have been a bit harsh, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. \n\nThe daughter is 12, which is a time of significant physical and emotional changes. She might not fully understand the social norms surrounding modesty yet. The parent's reasoning is based on the daughter now being a young woman, so the expectation is reasonable. However, the way it was communicated could have been more sensitive. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings, leading to a pouty reaction and withdrawal.\n\nThe husband's non-reaction might indicate that he's more laid-back about the issue, but the parent is still responsible for their own approach. The key here is whether the parent's actions were wrong. The parent had a valid concern, but the method of addressing it could have been improved. The daughter's emotional response suggests that the parent's approach was too direct and perhaps not age-appropriate. \n\nIn many cases, discussing such matters with empathy and providing explanations that the child can understand is better than being direct and causing emotional harm. The parent's intention was to set a boundary, which is okay, but the execution might have been flawed. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong in terms of the approach, not the intention. However, the core issue of setting appropriate expectations isn't wrong. It's a balance between the intent and the method. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. But the parent's way of handling it could be seen as part of the problem. The user initially thought the parent is in the wrong, and the analysis here supports that the parent's approach might be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
