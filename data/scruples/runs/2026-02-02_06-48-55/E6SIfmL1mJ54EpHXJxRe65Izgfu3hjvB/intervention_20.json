Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The parent explains that the daughter is in puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for extended periods. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad. The daughter possibly felt hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal norms. In many cultures, parents guide children on appropriate dress, especially as they enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach modesty, which is a common concern. However, the approach might have been too direct, potentially hurting the daughter's feelings. At 12, kids are becoming more aware of their bodies and personal autonomy, so the parent's method could be seen as overstepping if it's too strict without explanation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is addressing a legitimate issue\u2014maintaining boundaries in a co-ed household. The daughter's behavior, while not harmful, might be seen as lacking consideration for the father's comfort. The parent's intention is likely to prepare her for societal expectations and respect family values.\n\nThe husband's reaction might indicate differing views, but that's a separate issue. The key is whether the parent's action was wrong. If the parent's approach was respectful and age-appropriate, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the parent was too harsh or dismissive of the daughter's feelings without understanding her perspective, that could be problematic. The daughter being quiet suggests she felt upset, so the parent might need to adjust their communication style.\n\nOverall, while the parent's intention is valid, the execution might need refinement. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with a note on communication style.\n"
