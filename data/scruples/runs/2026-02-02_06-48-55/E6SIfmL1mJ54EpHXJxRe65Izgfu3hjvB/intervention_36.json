Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent, the author, is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent feels it's inappropriate for a young woman, so they told her to use a robe or cover up. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't support the conversation. The parent is now asking if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, parenting approaches, and the daughter's age. At 12, kids are becoming aware of their bodies and modesty. Different parents have different boundaries. Some might think it's okay for kids to be naked or in underclothes at home, but others, especially as their children hit puberty, set boundaries to teach them about appropriate dress, especially around the opposite parent. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. This seems to be about teaching modesty and setting expectations for a young girl. However, the parent is very direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't agree or wanted to avoid the topic. \n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, the parent is trying to set a boundary, which is a common parenting role. However, the execution might be the issue. If the parent was harsh or didn't explain it gently, that could be problematic. The daughter's reaction of being pouty and quiet shows she was upset. Maybe the parent should have approached it more sensitively, explaining the reasons in a way the daughter could understand without feeling criticized. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to prepare her for societal norms about modesty. At 12, it's a good time to start those conversations. The issue might not be the message itself but how it was delivered. The parent might have been right in the message but wrong in the delivery. \n\nAlso, the husband's non-supportive reaction is a factor, but the question is about the parent's actions. So, was the parent in the wrong? If the parent's intention was good but the approach was too direct and hurtful, then maybe they are in the wrong. If the approach was reasonable and the parent had the right to set boundaries, then not. \n\nI think it's a balance. The parent isn't wrong for setting a boundary, but maybe they were wrong in the way they delivered the message. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong overall. Since the parent's action was to enforce a reasonable boundary (covering up at home), even if the delivery was rough, the intent might be justified. So the answer might be No (B). But some might argue that the parent was too strict or that the daughter's autonomy is important. However, for a 12-year-old, parents usually have the authority to set such rules. So I'm leaning towards B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
