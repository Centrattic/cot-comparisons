Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The mom told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad. The daughter got upset, and the husband brushed it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. 12 is young, but puberty is happening. The mom's concern is about appropriate dress in the house, especially around the father. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being challenged. The mom is trying to set boundaries, which is part of parenting. However, the way she communicated it might have been too direct, causing hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not see it as a big issue, but the mom's intention was to address appropriate behavior.\n\nIn many cultures, there's a norm that girls should cover up in the presence of male family members as they grow up. The mom is enforcing that. However, the daughter's reaction shows she might not see it that way yet. The mom's approach could be seen as necessary for teaching respect and boundaries, but maybe she could have been more sensitive to her daughter's feelings. The key is whether the mom's actions were reasonable. Since the daughter is 12, it's a developmental stage where they're becoming more self-conscious. The mom's action isn't inherently wrong, but the communication could be improved. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is part of parenting, but there's room for more empathy in how it's done. However, some might argue that the mom is being overly strict. But given the context, the mom isn't wrong.\n"
