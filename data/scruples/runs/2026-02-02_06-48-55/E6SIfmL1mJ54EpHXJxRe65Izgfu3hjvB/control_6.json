Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is about a parent asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, and the parent is concerned about her walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter's feelings were hurt, the husband was dismissive, and the daughter has been quiet since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They're trying to set boundaries about modesty, which is a common parental concern. But the daughter is 12, so she's still a child, but also entering adolescence. The parent is trying to teach her about appropriate behavior in the home, especially regarding privacy and respect.\n\nThe parent is direct, which might have come off as harsh. The daughter's reaction of being pouty and then being quiet suggests she felt upset. The husband's reaction was to roll his eyes and change the subject, which might indicate he disagrees but doesn't confront the issue. However, the key here is whether the parent was wrong to address the behavior.\n\nIn many cultures, parents do set expectations about modesty at home. However, the approach matters. The parent did explain the reason, so that's good. But maybe the way it was said, being very direct, could be seen as not considering the daughter's feelings enough. Alternatively, it's also about teaching boundaries and respect for privacy.\n\nBut is making a 12-year-old wear a robe or clothes at home really wrong? The parent is preparing her for societal norms where modesty is expected. However, maybe the parent could have approached it more gently, considering the daughter's age and the fact that she's still a child. Also, the daughter might not see her father as a romantic partner yet, so the parent's concern about her being a young woman might be overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to protect the daughter's modesty and set appropriate boundaries. The husband's dismissal could be problematic, but the question is about the parent's actions.\n\nI think the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to set reasonable expectations. However, the method could be improved. But according to the options, the answer is either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Since the parent's intention is good, and the action is about setting boundaries, which is a parent's role, the answer might be B. But maybe the approach was too harsh, making the parent A. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the daughter's age and the parent's directness, maybe the parent is right to set the rules but could have been more gentle. So overall, not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
