Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The author told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter is being quiet.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about appropriateness, parenting style, and the daughter's feelings. At 12, kids are going through puberty, so body image and modesty can be sensitive topics. The parent's concern might stem from wanting to teach modesty or set boundaries. However, the way it was handled could be an issue. The parent was direct and the daughter felt hurt, leading to a pout and silence. The husband didn't support the conversation, which might add to the tension.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. It's important to teach kids about appropriate dress, even at home. However, the approach matters. Being too direct without considering the child's feelings might come off as harsh. Also, the parent's reasoning about the father's presence could be valid, but maybe there's a way to approach it more gently. The daughter's reaction shows she was affected, so maybe the parent should have explained more or been more empathetic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's reasonable for a parent to address modesty issues, especially as the child becomes a young woman. The parent isn't forcing her to dress a certain way but suggesting alternatives like a robe. The husband's lack of support isn't the parent's fault. So, balancing the need for guidance with sensitivity to the child's emotions is key. The parent might not be in the wrong, but could have handled it differently.\n"
