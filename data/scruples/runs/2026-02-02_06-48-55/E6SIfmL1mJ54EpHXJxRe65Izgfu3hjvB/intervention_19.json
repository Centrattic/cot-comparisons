Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, and the parent is concerned about her wearing just a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided discussing it further.\n\nHmm, so the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness and respect. But is it the parent's place to enforce modesty at home? In many cultures, parents set household rules about dress, even at home. However, a 12-year-old might be developing her own sense of autonomy. The parent's directness might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but the intention is about setting boundaries. The husband's reaction is a bit dismissive, but that's more about their relationship than the daughter's situation.\n\nI need to consider if the parent overstepped. Since it's their home, they can set rules about clothing. But the daughter might feel her privacy or comfort is being invaded. However, the parent is addressing a change in behavior as she becomes a young woman. The key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. The parent isn't forcing her into public dress, just adjusting for being in front of her father. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, parents have the right to set such boundaries. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
