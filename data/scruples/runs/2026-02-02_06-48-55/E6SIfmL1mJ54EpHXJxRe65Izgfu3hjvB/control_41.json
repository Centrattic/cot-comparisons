Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is going through puberty, has started wearing a bra, and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent told the daughter it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parenting approaches. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty, especially as children enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach the daughter about appropriate dress in front of parents, which is a typical part of guiding a child's understanding of body privacy and respect. \n\nHowever, the parent's approach was direct and caused the daughter to feel hurt. The daughter being 12 means she's in a sensitive age where self-image and peer opinions are important. The parent's method of addressing it might have been too abrupt, potentially making the daughter feel embarrassed or criticized. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes and avoiding the topic) might not be supportive, which could add to the daughter's distress.\n\nBut was the parent wrong? The act of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The key is how it was communicated and the daughter's reaction. The parent's intention was to guide the daughter in appropriate behavior, which is a valid goal. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. The daughter might need a discussion about privacy and respect rather than a direct correction that makes her feel scolded.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she might not realize that her behavior is inappropriate in this context. The parent might need to explain the reasons more gently, perhaps involving both parents in the conversation to provide a united yet supportive approach. The husband's reluctance to engage might be a red flag, as both parents should be on the same page when discussing such issues.\n\nIn summary, the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue, but their approach could have been more considerate. The main issue is the method rather than the intent. So, the answer would be B (the parent is not in the wrong), but with the note that their approach could be improved.\n"
