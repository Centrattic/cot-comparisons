Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent is concerned about appropriateness now that the daughter is going through puberty. The daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel, and the parent suggested using a robe. The husband didn't support the conversation, which might add to the tension.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the child becomes a young woman. That makes sense because as kids grow up, parents often adjust expectations around modesty. However, the parent is being direct and the daughter felt hurt, which is a red flag. The way the parent communicates could be an issue. Maybe they didn't consider the daughter's feelings or explain it in a way that's age-appropriate. \n\nBut then again, the daughter is 12 and in a warm house, so she might not realize the impropriety of being in underwear around her dad. The parent is trying to teach her about modesty in a family setting. However, the parent's approach might be too harsh. The daughter's reaction of being pouty and quiet suggests that the conversation wasn't handled gently. \n\nThe husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) might indicate he's more laid back, so the parent could have involved him more to present a united front. Also, the parent might need to consider if the daughter's behavior is typical for her age or if there's another reason she's not dressing appropriately. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might find the daughter's behavior inappropriate, while others might think it's normal at home. The key here is whether the parent's approach was respectful and age-appropriate. The parent's directness may have caused unnecessary hurt. Maybe a more supportive approach would have been better, like discussing body positivity and boundaries without making the daughter feel shamed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be entirely wrong in the message but could have handled it more sensitively. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intention is to set boundaries, but the execution could be improved. However, if the parent's actions were shaming or overly strict, then maybe A is the answer. But given the context, the parent's concern is valid, and the issue is more about communication style.\n"
