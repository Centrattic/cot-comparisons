Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a parent who asked their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wears a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt by the directness. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it. The daughter is quieter now.\n\nFirst, is it reasonable for a parent to set boundaries about clothing at home? Parents often do this for modesty, especially as kids get older. But at 12, it's a delicate age. The daughter is in her own home, so some might argue she has a right to privacy and comfort. However, the parent's concern about appropriateness in front of the father is valid. The parent is trying to teach boundaries and respect for herself and others.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have upset the daughter. Maybe a softer approach could have been better, but the intent is good. The husband's reaction isn't the parent's fault. The key question is whether the parent was wrong for setting this expectation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the parent is trying to guide their daughter on appropriate behavior and modesty as she grows up. It's a valid concern, even if the delivery could be improved. The parent isn't in the wrong for addressing this.\n"
