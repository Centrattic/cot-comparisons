Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe daughter is 12, going through puberty, and has started wearing less clothing at home, like a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The mother asked her to cover up more, explaining that as a young woman, it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father. The daughter might have felt hurt, and the husband didn't support the mother's approach, avoiding the conversation.\n\nFirst, I should consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries regarding modesty, especially during puberty. However, the daughter is still a child, and while she's entering adolescence, she might not fully grasp the social expectations yet. The mother's intention is to guide her, but the way she communicated it might have been too direct or harsh, leading to the daughter's poutiness. But is that the mother's fault, or is it just a natural reaction from the daughter?\n\nNext, the husband's reaction. He rolled his eyes and didn't engage, which could indicate he disagrees with the mother's approach or doesn't think it's a big issue. However, the mother might be right in setting these boundaries, especially considering the daughter's age and the fact that she's a minor. The daughter's behavior could be seen as normal for a child exploring her body, but the mother's concern about appropriateness in front of the father is valid in many contexts.\n\nThe key question is whether the mother overstepped. She's trying to teach her daughter about modesty and body respect, but the method might have been too abrupt. However, since the daughter is 12, some level of guidance is necessary. The mother isn't forcing her to cover up but is suggesting alternatives like a robe. The daughter's reaction might be more about the approach than the content. But the mother's reasoning is based on appropriateness, which is a common parental concern.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter's autonomy versus the mother's authority. At 12, children are developing a sense of independence, so strict rules might clash. However, the mother is in a position to guide her. The husband's lack of support could be a red flag, but that's a different issue. The main question is about the mother's action.\n\nIn many cases, parents are expected to set these boundaries, even if it leads to temporary tension. The mother's approach might not be wrong, but could use more sensitivity. However, the act of asking the daughter to dress more appropriately is not necessarily wrong. The daughter is still learning social norms, and the mother is fulfilling her role. The husband's reaction might indicate differing opinions, but that doesn't make the mother wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the mother is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
