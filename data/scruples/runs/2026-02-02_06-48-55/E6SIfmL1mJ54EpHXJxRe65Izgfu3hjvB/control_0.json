Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent talking to their 12-year-old daughter about dressing more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her to cover up, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got hurt feelings, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the parent was wrong. Let's break it down. The parent's intention is to set boundaries regarding modesty at home. The daughter is entering puberty, so body changes are happening. The parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior, which is a common parental role. However, the parent's approach was direct and may have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter's reaction (pouting, being quiet) suggests she felt upset. The husband's reaction indicates he might not agree with the approach or found it unnecessary, but he's avoiding conflict.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms, parents often guide children on modesty. However, the method of communication matters. Being direct can be effective, but if it's done without empathy, it might damage the parent-child relationship. At 12, the daughter is in a sensitive age where self-image is important. The parent's explanation about not being appropriate in front of the father makes sense, but the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The parent didn't consider the daughter's perspective or feelings, leading to hurt and tension.\n\nAlso, the husband's avoidance might mean he's not supportive of the boundary or thinks it's too strict. The parent might have overstepped if the daughter's behavior wasn't actually inappropriate. Wearing a towel after a shower is common, and a tank top and underwear at home might not be considered immodest by many standards. The parent's strictness could stem from personal values, but if it's causing distress, it's worth reevaluating.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is valid, but the approach might be too harsh. The daughter's feelings were hurt, and the husband's reaction shows possible disagreement. The parent isn't entirely wrong for setting boundaries, but they could have handled the conversation more sensitively. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is okay, but there are aspects where they could improve. However, some might argue that the parent was too strict. But given the context, the parent is trying to teach modesty, which is a common parental role, even if the method could be better.\n"
