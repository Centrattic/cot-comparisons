Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, a towel after showering. The parent thinks it's not appropriate because she's a young woman now. The parent told her to use a robe or dress more. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nSo, the key points here. Is the parent wrong? Well, the parent is trying to set boundaries about appropriate dress at home, considering puberty. But maybe the way they approached it was harsh. The daughter is 12; some kids might be more modest, others not. The parent being direct could have hurt her feelings. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he didn't agree or didn't want to discuss it. \n\nBut is covering up at home a cultural or family norm? In some families, kids wear less at home, others prefer more modesty. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of the father, so setting a boundary. However, the method might be the issue. The daughter might not fully understand yet, and being told directly without explanation could make her feel criticized. \n\nAlso, the parent's husband didn't support the conversation, which might mean the parent acted unilaterally. Maybe they should have had a family discussion. But the parent's intention is to address changing norms as the daughter grows. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is still a child, and transitioning into adolescence. The parent's role is to guide, but the approach matters. If the parent was respectful and explained the reasons, maybe not wrong. But if they were harsh or dismissive, maybe yes. The daughter's reaction (pouting, being quiet) suggests she felt hurt. \n\nIn some contexts, a parent setting such boundaries is normal. However, the way it was handled could be problematic. The parent might not be in the wrong for setting the boundary but could have handled it more sensitively. So the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to set appropriate expectations, but the method could be improved. However, if the parent's approach was too strict without considering the daughter's perspective, then maybe A. But given the situation, the parent's main point is about appropriateness as she's growing up, which is a valid concern. So B.\n"
