Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel post-shower. The parent explained it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman.\n\nThe parent used a direct approach, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter became quiet. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, considering the daughter's age, 12 is a time when kids are becoming more aware of their bodies and societal norms. Parents often guide their children on appropriate dress, especially as they enter adolescence. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriate boundaries between parent and child. However, the approach matters. Being direct is okay, but if it's done in a way that makes the child feel criticized or embarrassed, it could lead to hurt feelings. The parent might not have been \"wrong\" in the message, but the delivery could be improved. The husband's reaction might indicate he felt the approach was too harsh or unnecessary. The key is whether the parent's intent was to teach appropriate behavior without shaming the child. Since the daughter is in a sensitive age, the parent might need to balance guidance with empathy. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're setting boundaries, but their method could be problematic. However, the user thinks the parent is wrong, so maybe there's a different perspective. Alternatively, considering the daughter's feelings and the husband's disengagement, the parent might have been too strict. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the parent's intention is good, but the execution could be better. So, maybe the answer is B (not wrong), but with a note that the approach needs adjustment.\n"
