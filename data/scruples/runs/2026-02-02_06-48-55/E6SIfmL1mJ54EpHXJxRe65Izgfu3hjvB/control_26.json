Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, entering puberty, and has started to change her clothing habits. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent addressed it directly, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband didn't support the parent's approach.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries around modesty at home can be a parent's responsibility, especially as kids enter puberty. However, the approach matters. Being direct might have been necessary, but the daughter's feelings were hurt, so maybe the parent could have handled it more gently. The husband's reaction might indicate differing views on how to handle such situations, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parent was wrong. \n\nCultural and family norms play a role here. In some families, more modesty is expected, while others are more relaxed. The parent's concern is about appropriateness and the daughter's growing into a young woman. However, enforcing this could be seen as overstepping if the daughter is in her own home and the parents are both present. But since the daughter is a minor, parents have the right to set such rules. \n\nThe key points are: the parent had a legitimate concern about modesty, addressed it directly, which might have been hurtful, and the husband's lack of support. The wrongness depends on the approach and the family's values. Since the parent is acting in what they believe is the child's best interest, even if the method could be improved, they might not be entirely in the wrong. However, there's room to argue that the parent's tone and the husband's reaction could have been better handled. But overall, the parent's intent is to guide the daughter, which is part of parenting. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no aspect where the parent was unreasonable. The daughter is in her own home, so expecting her to cover up more could be seen as necessary for her own development in understanding appropriate dress, even in private. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
