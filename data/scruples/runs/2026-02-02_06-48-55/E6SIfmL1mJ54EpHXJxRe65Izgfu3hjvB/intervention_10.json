Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. The parent mentions that she's been wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after a shower. The parent talked to her about this, suggesting she use a robe or dress, explaining that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter's feelings might have been hurt, and the husband didn't support the conversation, avoiding the topic.\n\nSo, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries related to modesty and body privacy in the home. But is this appropriate? Well, in many cultures, parents do set rules about dress, especially as children reach puberty and become more aware of their bodies. However, the daughter is still a child, and the parent's approach might affect her self-esteem or body image. The parent was direct, which might have been harsh, and the daughter's reaction (pouting, being quiet) suggests she felt hurt. The husband's nonchalant response might indicate he doesn't share the parent's concern, which could create a lack of support for the parent's approach.\n\nOn one hand, teaching modesty and respect for family boundaries is a common parenting goal. On the other, the way it's communicated matters. The parent might have been too abrupt, not considering the daughter's feelings. At 12, a child is developing their identity, and such conversations need to be handled with sensitivity. The parent could have approached it with more empathy, explaining the reasons without making her feel shamed. The husband's reluctance to engage might mean the parent is overstepping, but it's also possible he's dismissive of important discussions.\n\nAnother angle: in some contexts, a 12-year-old might still be considered a child, and the parent's concern about being in front of the father could be about protecting the child's innocence or preventing awkwardness. However, the daughter's behavior (wearing a towel for hours) might be seen as normal for a child, especially in a warm home. The parent's standards might be too strict, leading to unnecessary conflict.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on cultural norms and how the conversation was handled. If the parent's approach was shaming or too direct without empathy, that could be problematic. But if the concern is about appropriate behavior in the home and the parent is setting a boundary, that's a valid parenting choice. The key is whether the parent's actions were supportive and respectful. The fact that the daughter was hurt and the husband didn't support the conversation might suggest the parent's approach was too harsh. So maybe the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) if setting boundaries is seen as right, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
