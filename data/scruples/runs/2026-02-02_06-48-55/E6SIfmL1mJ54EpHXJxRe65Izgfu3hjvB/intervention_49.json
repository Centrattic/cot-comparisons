Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent suggests she use a robe or dress more appropriately, explaining it's not appropriate for her young womanhood. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nHmm. First, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the daughter grows up. The parent is being direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. But is that wrong? Well, children need guidance on appropriate behavior, even at home. The parent is trying to teach her about modesty and respect for herself and others, especially the father. The daughter is 12, so it's a good time to start these conversations as she enters adolescence.\n\nBut maybe the parent could have approached it more gently. The daughter might feel embarrassed or not respected by being told off in front of others. However, the parent's message is valid. The husband's reaction is concerning because it might undermine the parent's authority, but that's more about the marital dynamic. The key question is whether it's wrong to set this expectation. I don't think the parent is in the wrong. They're addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and the daughter's transition into womanhood. The approach could be improved, but the intent isn't harmful. So answer B.\n"
