Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is in puberty, and it's not appropriate to walk around half-naked around her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't back the parent up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around children's modesty and parental guidance. At 12, a child is entering adolescence, so the parent's concern about appropriate behavior in front of a parent might be valid from a traditional perspective. But it's also important to consider the child's autonomy and the parent's approach. The parent was direct, which might have come off as harsh, especially if the daughter felt her feelings were hurt. The husband's reaction suggests maybe there's a difference in how they handle such situations.\n\nI should also think about cultural context. In some cultures, children are allowed more freedom with their clothing at home, while others emphasize modesty. The parent's approach might be seen as necessary for teaching boundaries, but if the method was too abrupt without explaining the reasoning well, that's a problem. The daughter's reaction (being quiet) indicates she's upset, so the parent might need a more empathetic approach next time.\n\nThe key points are: age-appropriate behavior, communication style, and the parent's intention to teach modesty. The parent isn't necessarily wrong in the content of the message but could have handled the delivery better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the action itself (asking to cover up) is inappropriate. Given that, the parent's concern is valid, so the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
