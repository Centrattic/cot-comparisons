Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty, so her body is changing. She's been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house.\n\nThe parent approached her directly, explaining that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation. The parent is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's considered appropriate for parents to set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children become adolescents. The parent's intention seems to be about respect and setting expectations as the daughter transitions into womanhood. However, the way the parent approached it might have been too direct or harsh, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The father's reaction of rolling his eyes might have undermined the message, leading to confusion.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, 12 is when puberty starts, so her body changes are natural. The parent's concern is valid, but the communication style could be an issue. Was the parent wrong? Maybe not entirely, because setting boundaries is part of parenting. But maybe they could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps having a private conversation without making the daughter feel criticized. The husband's lack of support might have contributed to the daughter's negative reaction. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach might need adjustment. Answer B (No) seems correct.\n"
