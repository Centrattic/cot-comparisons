Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned she walks around in a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent suggested using a robe or putting on clothes, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many Western societies, there's a shift in modesty expectations as children enter puberty. Parents often set boundaries about appropriate dress at home, especially when there are same-sex parents present. The parent's concern is about maintaining appropriate boundaries and teaching self-respect. However, the approach might be too direct for a 12-year-old, especially if it's hurtful. The daughter's reaction (being pouty, quiet) suggests she felt upset. The husband's dismissal might indicate he didn't think the parent was wrong, but his reaction isn't clear.\n\nPossible angles: The parent isn't wrong in setting boundaries, but the way they communicated it might have been harsh. Alternatively, the parent might be overstepping if the daughter's behavior isn't harmful. It's important to balance the child's autonomy and the parent's responsibility to guide. Since the daughter is 12, she's at an age where body image and self-esteem are sensitive. The parent's intention was good, but maybe the delivery could be softer. Also, the father's avoidance of the conversation might be a red flag about not engaging properly, but the question is about the parent's wrongdoing.\n\nThe key is whether the parent was wrong in setting the expectation. Generally, parents have the right to set such rules. However, the method of communication could be improved. The answer would lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B), but maybe with a note about communication style. The main issue is whether the parent's action itself was wrong, which it isn't, as they're teaching appropriate behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
