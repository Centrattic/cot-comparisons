Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parent has a 12-year-old daughter who's going through puberty. The daughter is walking around the house in just a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent finds this inappropriate now that the daughter is a young woman and tells her to cover up more. When the parent tells her, the daughter is hurt, the husband rolls his eyes, and the daughter is now being quiet. The parent is asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. 12 is a typical age for puberty to start. The parent is addressing the daughter's clothing choices, which is a common issue as kids become teenagers. The parent is concerned about her modesty, especially around the father. It's a good idea to set boundaries as the child grows, so that's understandable.\n\nHowever, the parent is very direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter might be going through body image issues or just not realizing that her actions are inappropriate. The parent's approach could be too harsh, especially if the daughter is still adjusting to her changing body. Maybe the parent could have approached the conversation more gently, explaining the reasons without making the daughter feel criticized.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also a factor. By rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation, he might be dismissing the parent's concerns, but that's more about their relationship. The key is whether the parent was wrong to bring up the issue. Since the parent is trying to guide the daughter towards appropriate behavior, that's a valid concern. However, the way it was handled might not be the best approach.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to expect a 12-year-old to dress appropriately in the house, especially around parents. On the other hand, the parent's directness and the daughter's hurt feelings suggest that the approach could have been more empathetic. The parent might not be in the wrong for addressing the behavior, but could have done it more sensitively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's intention is good, but the execution might have been lacking. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent is trying to enforce appropriate behavior, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the approach was too harsh, maybe they are. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the parent is not in the wrong for addressing the issue itself, but perhaps could have handled it better. Since the options are A or B, and the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, I think the answer would be B (No), because they're not in the wrong, but could improve their approach.\n"
