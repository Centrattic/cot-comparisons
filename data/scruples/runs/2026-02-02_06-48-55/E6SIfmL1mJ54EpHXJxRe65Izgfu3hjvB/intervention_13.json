Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, and the parent is concerned about her walking around half-dressed. The parent explained it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, leading the parent to question their approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty, especially as children reach puberty. The parent's intention seems to be protecting the daughter's modesty and preparing her for societal expectations. However, the daughter's reaction\u2014being pouty and quiet\u2014suggests the approach might have been too harsh or not age-appropriate. At 12, a child is still developing emotionally, and directness without empathy might hurt her feelings. The parent's husband dismissing the issue could add to the daughter's confusion or insecurity.\n\nBut then, the parent's concern isn't without merit. Puberty brings physical changes, and teaching appropriate behavior is part of parenting. The key here is the method. Was the parent too strict or not? If the parent didn't explain the reasoning clearly or failed to acknowledge the daughter's feelings, that's a problem. The parent did explain it's about appropriateness, but maybe the tone was too harsh, hence the daughter's hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the husband's lack of support might contribute to the daughter feeling unsupported. However, the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent was trying to enforce family values, which is their right. However, using a direct and firm approach without considering the daughter's emotional state might be where they went wrong. Balancing guidance with empathy is crucial in parenting. So, the answer might be that the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the user initially thought the parent is in the wrong. Need to decide if the parent's action, despite possible harshness, is justified.\n"
