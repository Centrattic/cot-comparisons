Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially as children enter puberty. The parent's intention seems to be about teaching appropriate behavior and respect for family members. However, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and how the parent communicated this might have been harsh. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction isn't supportive, which could add to the daughter's distress.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? On one hand, setting boundaries is part of parenting. On the other, the approach might be too strict or not age-appropriate. The key is whether the parent's actions are reasonable given the situation. Some might argue that at home, kids can be more comfortable, but the parent is concerned about the daughter's awareness of her body and appropriateness around family. The parent's reasoning is about transitioning into womanhood, which is a valid concern. However, the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted. The parent's directness might be the issue here, not the act of setting a rule. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but could approach it more sensitively. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if the parent's actions cross a line. Since the parent is addressing puberty and setting reasonable household rules, they're not in the wrong. The problem might be in communication style, not the content. So answer B.\n"
