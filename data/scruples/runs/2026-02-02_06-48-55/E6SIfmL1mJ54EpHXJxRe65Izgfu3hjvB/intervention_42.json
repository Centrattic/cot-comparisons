Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear around the house, which the parent finds inappropriate now that she's a \"young woman.\" The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father, leading to the daughter being upset and her husband avoiding the conversation.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention here is to set boundaries about modesty. It's a common concern when kids hit puberty\u2014parents often adjust expectations as their bodies change. The parent was direct, which might have come off as harsh, but the reasoning is about respect and appropriateness. \n\nBut wait, is a parent wrong to enforce such rules? At 12, kids are developing independence, so how the parent communicates this matters. The parent might not be in the wrong for setting the expectation, but maybe the delivery could be softened. However, the parent is in a position to guide their child's behavior, so it's a judgment call.\n\nThe husband's reaction might be another angle\u2014maybe he disagrees, but the parent still has a right to enforce their own standards. The daughter's feelings being hurt could be due to the directness rather than the message itself. \n\nIn many cultures, parents do teach children about modesty, especially in mixed-gender settings. The parent isn't forcing inappropriate behavior but is preparing the daughter for societal norms. So, the parent's stance isn't inherently wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but considering the daughter's age and the sensitivity of the situation, maybe there's room for both perspectives. However, the parent's action is a reasonable part of parenting, so I think B makes sense.\n"
