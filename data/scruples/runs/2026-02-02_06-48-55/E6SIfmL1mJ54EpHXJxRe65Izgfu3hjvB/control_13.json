Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty, and the parent is concerned about her being in a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness given the daughter is now a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children reach puberty. The parent is addressing behavior that might be acceptable for younger kids but is now considered inappropriate as the daughter becomes a teenager. The parent's approach was direct, which might have been harsh, but the intention seems to be about teaching appropriate behavior.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014might indicate he's less concerned, but that doesn't mean the parent is wrong. The daughter's hurt feelings suggest the parent could have been more sensitive in delivery, maybe using a softer approach or explaining the reasons more carefully. However, the core issue is about setting boundaries, which is a parenting responsibility. \n\nThe parent isn't forcing the daughter to get dressed but is encouraging her to use a robe or dress appropriately. There's no indication of shaming beyond what's necessary for teaching modesty. So while the method might need refinement, the parent's intent is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
