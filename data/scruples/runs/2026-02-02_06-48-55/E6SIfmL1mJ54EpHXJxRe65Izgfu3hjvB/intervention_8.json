Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who made their 12-year-old daughter cover up more is in the wrong. The parent explains that the daughter is going through puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, and the daughter was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty, especially as children enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior, which is a typical part of child-rearing. However, the daughter's age is relevant. At 12, she's becoming more aware of her body, and the parent's approach might come off as abrupt or not age-appropriate. The parent was direct and the daughter felt hurt, which suggests communication could be an issue. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) might indicate differing views on how to handle the situation with a teenage daughter. \n\nIs the parent wrong for setting a boundary? Not necessarily. Teaching modesty and personal boundaries is part of parenting. However, the way it was communicated might have been too harsh. The parent could have approached it more gently, validating the daughter's feelings while explaining the reasons. The fact that the daughter became quiet and pouty shows the approach may have been too direct without enough empathy. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's autonomy is important. At 12, she's old enough to understand the reasoning, but the parent's method of enforcing it might have caused unnecessary distress. The key issue is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. While the intention is good, the method could be improved. However, the parent is not in the wrong for wanting to establish appropriate behavior. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be adjusted for better communication.\n"
