Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty and used to walk around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate in front of the father, but the husband dismissed the issue. The daughter is now quiet and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They're trying to teach appropriate behavior, which is a common concern when kids enter puberty. But the approach might be an issue. The parent is direct and the daughter's reaction was hurt feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation, which might add to the confusion for the child.\n\nIs covering up necessary in the home? It depends on family values. Some parents might think it's important for modesty, especially with a father present. Others might see it as okay since it's private. The key is whether the parent's action is reasonable given their values. However, the way it was communicated could be a problem. Being very direct might have upset the daughter, especially if she's not used to such strictness. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, which is a time of body changes and self-consciousness. Making her feel embarrassed about her body could affect her self-esteem. The parent's approach might not account for her emotional state. Additionally, the husband's lack of support might leave the daughter confused about the rules.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the intention is to set a boundary, which isn't inherently wrong. But the method\u2014being very direct without considering the daughter's feelings\u2014might be problematic. The parent might not have explained the reasoning in a compassionate way. So, maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. However, the user thinks the parent is in the wrong, so I need to weigh the options again.\n\nThe core question is whether the parent's action was wrong. If the parent was trying to enforce a family rule for modesty, that's their right. But if they didn't consider the child's feelings and the context, that's an issue. The daughter's reaction suggests the parent's approach was hurtful. So maybe the parent is in the wrong because they didn't balance the message with empathy.\n"
