Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent is concerned because the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel, and they think it's inappropriate now that she's a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical expectations for children's privacy and modesty at home. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, it's common for parents to set boundaries around appropriate attire at home, especially as children enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach their daughter about modesty and the changes that come with puberty, which seems like a reasonable concern.\n\nBut wait, is there an age-appropriate aspect here? A 12-year-old is still young, and some might argue that being overly strict could be unnecessary. However, the parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty, so there's a biological and social development aspect. The parent's approach is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction seems dismissive, which could indicate a lack of support for the parent's approach. However, the parent is trying to address the issue, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's behavior. Walking around in minimal clothing at home might be considered normal for some families, but others might set different boundaries. The parent is not punishing her, just asking her to cover up when in the house. The key is whether the parent's request is reasonable and respectful. The parent didn't forbid the behavior entirely but suggested alternatives like a robe, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe daughter's reaction being pouty and the parent's directness causing hurt feelings might suggest that the approach could have been more gentle, but the intent was to set appropriate boundaries. The husband's non-reaction is notable, but the parent's action itself was to guide the daughter, which is part of parenting. So, considering all these factors, the parent is likely not in the wrong. They're addressing a developmental stage appropriately, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
