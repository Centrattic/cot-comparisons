Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the mother) is in the wrong for asking her 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The mother told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got pouty, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's appropriate for a 12-year-old. Puberty is a time when bodies change, and parents often need to address boundaries. At home, privacy and modesty can be family norms. The mother's intention is to set boundaries, which is a common parenting approach. However, the way she communicated it might have been too direct, causing the daughter's feelings to be hurt.\n\nBut is the mother wrong? Well, setting reasonable expectations about clothing at home is not inherently wrong. Many families have rules about dressing appropriately, even at home, to respect others' comfort levels. The issue might be more about communication style. The mother was direct, which the daughter might not have been ready for, but that doesn't necessarily make the mother wrong. The husband's reaction doesn't validate her approach, but that's his personal opinion.\n\nThe daughter is 12, which is a sensitive age. The mother is trying to guide her into adolescence with appropriate behavior. The key points are: the mother's action was about setting boundaries, which is normal parenting; the method could be adjusted for sensitivity. So the answer would be B (No, the mother is not in the wrong). However, I should check if there's any cultural or contextual factors I'm missing. In many cultures, it's considered appropriate for parents to guide children on modesty. The mother isn't forcing her to wear specific clothes, just suggesting alternatives like a robe. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
