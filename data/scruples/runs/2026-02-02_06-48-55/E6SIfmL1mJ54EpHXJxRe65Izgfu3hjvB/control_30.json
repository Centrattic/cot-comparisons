Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent mentioned the daughter is in puberty and walks around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent tried to explain it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes, and the parent is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, there's a shift in modesty expectations as children become teenagers. The parent is addressing the daughter's behavior, which could be seen as a normal part of parenting. However, the approach might be an issue. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the approach, maybe seeing it as unnecessary or too strict. \n\nBut the parent's reasoning is about appropriate boundaries, especially given the daughter's age and developing body. It's also about setting expectations that align with societal norms. The parent didn't force the daughter to dress in a specific way but explained the social appropriateness. The daughter's reaction and the husband's eye-roll indicate potential tension, but that doesn't necessarily make the parent wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could have handled it more gently, perhaps discussing it without making the daughter feel criticized. However, the core issue is about setting boundaries, which is a valid parental role. The parent isn't being cruel, just firm. The husband's avoidance of the discussion might be a red flag, but that's a separate issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to teach the daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior in front of family members as she grows. While the delivery could be improved, the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue. So the answer is B.\n"
