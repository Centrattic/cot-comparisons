Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is going through puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, and sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told the daughter it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention is to set boundaries as the daughter is growing up. But is this the right approach? At 12, kids are becoming more self-conscious about their bodies. The parent is trying to teach modesty, which is a common concern. However, the way the parent approached it might have been too direct, causing emotional harm. The daughter's reaction\u2014pouting and being quiet\u2014suggests the conversation was uncomfortable. The husband's dismissive response doesn't help either. \n\nThe parent might be right in wanting to establish appropriate dress standards, but the execution could be improved. Maybe a more empathetic approach, discussing boundaries without making the daughter feel criticized, would be better. Also, considering the daughter's age, she might need guidance on body image and respect, but the parent needs to balance that with understanding her feelings. The parent's directness might have come across as harsh, leading to hurt feelings. However, the parent isn't entirely wrong for wanting to address this. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but there are areas to improve how the conversation was handled.\n"
