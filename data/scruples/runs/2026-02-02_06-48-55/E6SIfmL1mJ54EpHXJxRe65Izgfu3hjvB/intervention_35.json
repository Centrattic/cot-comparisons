Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe parent is asking if they're at fault for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it.\n\nFirst thought: 12 is a young age, but puberty is happening. Parents often set boundaries about modesty. But how strict should they be? At home, kids might be more relaxed, but as they grow, modesty expectations change. The parent is trying to adjust to her daughter's changing body and set appropriate boundaries.\n\nBut maybe the parent could have handled it more gently. The daughter might be self-conscious about her body during puberty, and being told to cover up could hurt her feelings. The parent was direct, which might not be the best approach. Also, the husband's reaction wasn't supportive, which could have added to the daughter's distress.\n\nHowever, the parent's intent was to teach appropriate behavior. It's reasonable to expect kids to wear clothes that cover them, even at home. The key is whether the parent's approach was respectful and age-appropriate. At 12, the daughter is old enough to understand modesty, but the parent should consider her feelings and maybe have a more compassionate conversation.\n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong for setting the boundary but could have done better in how they communicated it. The husband's dismissal of the issue isn't helpful either. So, maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
