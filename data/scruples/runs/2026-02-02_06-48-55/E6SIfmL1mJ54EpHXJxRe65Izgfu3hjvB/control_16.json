Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty and has started wearing less, like a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness, especially regarding the father being her parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children go through puberty. The parent wants to teach their daughter about body autonomy and appropriate dress around family. That makes sense. However, the approach might be an issue. The parent was direct and might have hurt the daughter's feelings, which is a concern. Directness isn't necessarily wrong, but if it's done without sensitivity, it can lead to conflict.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014suggests he might not agree with the approach or is uncomfortable. The daughter being quiet today indicates she's upset. The parent might not have considered the daughter's perspective or explained the reasoning in a way that's age-appropriate and empathetic. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent was wrong to address the behavior. Since the daughter is 12 and entering adolescence, setting boundaries is part of parenting. The parent's intention is about respect and appropriateness. However, the method of communication could be improved. The parent might need to balance setting rules with understanding the daughter's feelings during this sensitive time.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for the action, but the way it was handled could be better. The question is whether the parent is wrong for the action itself. Since the parent is setting reasonable boundaries, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). However, the approach could be more compassionate. The key is that setting such boundaries is a common parental role, even if the delivery could be improved. Therefore, the parent isn't wrong for having the conversation, even if the execution had issues.\n"
