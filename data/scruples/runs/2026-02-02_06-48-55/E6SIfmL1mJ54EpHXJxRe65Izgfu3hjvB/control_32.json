Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the daughter is going through puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions that she wears a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after a shower. The parent suggests using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not right for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, the husband was dismissive. The parent is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, parenting approaches, and the child's age. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty, especially as children become teenagers. However, how it's communicated matters. The parent was direct, which might have come off as harsh, causing the daughter to feel embarrassed or upset. The husband's reaction of rolling his eyes might have added to the tension. But the parent's intention seems to be about setting appropriate boundaries for their daughter's development. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is addressing a developmental stage and trying to teach modesty. On the other hand, the approach might have been too abrupt, and the husband's lack of support could have made the daughter feel unsupported. However, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to guide their daughter. It's about balance. The key is whether the parent overstepped or if their intent is valid. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because setting such boundaries is common, but the method could be improved. But the question is specifically if the author is wrong. Since the parent had a valid reason and the daughter is at an age where such discussions are necessary, the answer is B.\n"
