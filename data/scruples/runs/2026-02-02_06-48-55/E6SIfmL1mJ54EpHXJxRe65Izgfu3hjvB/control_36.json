Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned that the house is warm, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The dad was direct, maybe hurt her feelings, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's actions were wrong. The key points here are about setting boundaries for a child entering puberty. It's common for parents to adjust expectations as kids grow. The daughter is 12, so discussing modesty at home is part of teaching social norms. However, the parent's approach might have been too direct, leading to hurt feelings. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) could indicate a lack of support, which might have made the daughter feel more upset.\n\nBut the parent isn't doing something harmful. They're trying to guide their child on appropriate behavior. The issue is more about approach rather than the act of setting boundaries. So, the parent isn't entirely wrong, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the parent's intention is to set a reasonable expectation for modesty, and there's no evidence of abuse or overstepping, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The approach could be improved, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
