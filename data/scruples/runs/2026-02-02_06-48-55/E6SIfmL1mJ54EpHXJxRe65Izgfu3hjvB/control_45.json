Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is going through puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear, or just a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, considering the daughter's age and the context of puberty, it's a sensitive time. The parent's intention seems to be setting boundaries, which is a common parental role. However, the approach might have been too direct without considering the daughter's feelings. The parent acknowledged that the daughter's feelings might have been hurt, which suggests that the method could have been more empathetic. \n\nThe husband's reaction of rolling his eyes might indicate a differing opinion or discomfort, but he didn't confront the parent. The daughter's silence could be a sign of being upset. However, teaching appropriate behavior, especially regarding modesty in a household with a father present, is a valid concern. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to wear specific clothes but is encouraging her to use a robe or clothing. \n\nIt's important to balance setting boundaries with maintaining a good relationship. The parent might need to approach the conversation with more sensitivity, perhaps discussing the reasons and ensuring the daughter feels respected. But in terms of the action itself\u2014asking for more coverage\u2014the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue could be the method of communication rather than the intent. So, the parent's intent is reasonable, but the execution could be improved. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
