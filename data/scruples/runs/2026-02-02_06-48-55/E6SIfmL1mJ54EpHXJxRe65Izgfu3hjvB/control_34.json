Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours post-shower.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about appropriateness, especially with the father being present. They mentioned being direct and possibly hurting the daughter's feelings. The husband brushed it off, which might have added to the tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting norms. Many cultures encourage modesty at home, especially as kids enter puberty. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is a common practice. However, the daughter is 12, and her behavior might be typical for a pre-teen\u2014experimenting with body image, not fully aware of societal norms yet.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct. They explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father. The daughter felt hurt, which could mean the parent might have been too harsh. But the intent was to teach appropriateness, which is a valid concern. However, the method might need adjustment\u2014maybe a more gentle approach with discussion rather than a direct command.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also a factor. He didn't support the parent's action, which might confuse the daughter. Consistency in parenting is important. The parent brought it up later, but the husband wanted to drop it, which could leave the parent feeling unsupported.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is okay, but the way it was done might have been insensitive. The parent's intention is valid, but the execution could be improved. So maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the concern is valid, though the approach could be adjusted.\n"
