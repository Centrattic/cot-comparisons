Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent explained that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nSo, should the parent have said something? Well, parents often set boundaries about dress, especially as kids become teenagers. The parent's intention seems to be about setting appropriate standards for a young woman, considering her father is present. But the daughter is 12, which is pretty young for such a discussion. Maybe the parent was too direct, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. The husband's reaction might indicate he thinks it's not a big issue, but the parent's concern is about modesty and appropriateness. However, different families have different norms. It's possible the parent is overstepping, but also trying to teach appropriate behavior. The answer might depend on cultural or family values. However, the parent's actions were to guide their daughter, which is common. But maybe the approach was too harsh for a 12-year-old. I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it more gently. So answer B.\n"
