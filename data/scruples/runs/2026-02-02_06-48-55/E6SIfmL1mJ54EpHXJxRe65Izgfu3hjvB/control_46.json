Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty and walks around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent tried to explain that it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman, but the daughter got upset, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. At 12, teenagers are going through puberty, and body image and privacy become important. The parent's intention seems to be about modesty and setting boundaries, which is common. However, the way the conversation went might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The parent is direct, which might not be the best approach for a sensitive topic with a pre-teen. The husband's reaction adds tension, but the main question is about the parent's actions.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, teaching modesty and respect for family boundaries isn't inherently wrong. However, the approach might have been too abrupt, leading to emotional harm. The parent could have handled it more gently, considering the daughter's feelings and the developmental stage. The husband's dismissal of the issue might not help, but the parent's actions aren't entirely in the wrong. It's a balance between setting appropriate boundaries and communication style. The answer likely leans toward not being in the wrong (B), but there's room for improvement in how it's handled.\n"
