Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing less clothing, like a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt her feelings were hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They're trying to set boundaries about modesty and privacy, which is a common concern during puberty. The parent is being direct, which might have come off as harsh, but the intention seems to be about teaching appropriate behavior. However, the daughter's reaction and the husband's dismissiveness show there's tension here.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it wrong to ask a 12-year-old to dress more modestly in her own home? In many cultures, parents do set such boundaries to promote privacy and respect, especially around the opposite parent. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have been necessary, but if it hurt the daughter's feelings, maybe they could have handled it with more sensitivity. The husband's reaction isn't the parent's fault, but it affects the daughter's response.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, which is a time when kids start developing a sense of identity and may be more self-conscious. The parent's approach needs to balance teaching boundaries without damaging their relationship. The parent isn't wrong for setting the rule, but maybe could have done it more gently. The answer hinges on whether setting the boundary is wrong, which it's not, but the delivery might be an area to improve. So the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
