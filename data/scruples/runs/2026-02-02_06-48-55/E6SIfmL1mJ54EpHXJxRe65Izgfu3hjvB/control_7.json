Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The dad rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it. The daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parenting approaches. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty, especially as kids enter puberty. The parent's concern is about appropriateness in front of the father, which is reasonable. However, the direct approach might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter is 12, so she's at an age where body image and privacy are sensitive topics. The parent's tone and method of communication could be an issue here. If the parent was too harsh, that might be problematic. But the parent's intention is to teach her about modesty and boundaries, which is a valid concern. The husband's reaction of rolling his eyes might not support the parent's approach, but the main question is about the parent's action. The parent isn't in the wrong for trying to set boundaries, but maybe could have handled it more gently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, so the answer would be B (No), because setting appropriate boundaries isn't wrong, even if the delivery could be improved. The key is that the parent's action is a reasonable part of guiding their daughter through puberty.\n"
