Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question about their 12-year-old daughter is in the wrong. The author is a parent who asked their daughter to dress more appropriately at home, especially now that she's going through puberty. The daughter was wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father because she's becoming a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, there's an expectation that as children enter puberty, they start dressing more modestly, even at home. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is a common practice. However, the daughter is 12, so she's still quite young. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband's reaction was dismissive, not supporting the parent's action. \n\nThe key points here are: the parent's intention to guide their daughter on appropriate dress, the age of the child, the method of communication, and the husband's lack of support. The parent might be in the right because they're addressing a reasonable concern about modesty. However, the way they communicated it might have been too harsh for a 12-year-old. But since the parent is trying to enforce appropriate behavior, which is their responsibility, they might not be in the wrong. The husband's nonchalant attitude could be a problem, but the question is about the parent's actions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a 12-year-old in her own home has some autonomy and the parent's reaction is overstepping. But given the context of puberty and family values, the parent's response seems justified. The answer likely leans towards the parent not being in the wrong. The daughter's feelings were hurt, but that's more about the communication style than the rightness of the request itself.\n"
