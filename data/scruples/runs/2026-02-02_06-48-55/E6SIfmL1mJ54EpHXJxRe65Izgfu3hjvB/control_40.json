Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's been wearing tank tops and underwear at home, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent thinks this is inappropriate now that she's a young woman and wants her to use a robe or dress more appropriately. They had a conversation where the daughter was hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't support the parent. The parent is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about setting boundaries regarding modesty in the home. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, there's a norm that as children grow into adolescence, parents set expectations about appropriate dress, even at home. The parent is probably trying to instill modesty and prepare the daughter for societal expectations. But the daughter is in a transitional phase, and her behavior might be typical for her age\u2014puberty often brings changes in body image and comfort levels.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have been harsh. The daughter felt hurt, which suggests the parent could have handled the conversation more gently. However, the parent's intent was to set a boundary, which is a reasonable expectation for a parent to have. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes) might indicate that he disagrees with the approach or the timing, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, they had a valid concern about appropriateness, but their method might have been too direct. However, the question is about whether they were in the wrong. Since setting boundaries is part of parenting, even if the delivery could be improved, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I should consider cultural norms and the age of the child. At 12, it's reasonable to start discussing such matters. The parent isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more sensitively. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
