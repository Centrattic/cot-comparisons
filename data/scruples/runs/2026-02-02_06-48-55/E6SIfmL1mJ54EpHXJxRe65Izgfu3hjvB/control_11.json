Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty and has started wearing less, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel after a shower. The parent asked her to use a robe or put something on, explaining it's not appropriate for her father. The daughter was hurt, her father brushed it off, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting practices. At 12, puberty is common, and parents often start setting boundaries about modesty. The parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior, which is part of raising a child. However, the daughter is still a child, so the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have hurt feelings. But is that wrong? Being direct can be necessary, but the method could affect the child's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the father's reaction. He rolled his eyes and didn't support the mother, which might have confused the daughter. But the mother is the one who initiated the conversation. The key question is whether the mother was wrong to have the conversation. Since it's about setting boundaries and teaching modesty, which is a common parental role, she's probably not wrong. However, maybe she could have approached it more gently. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (No), as parenting decisions like this aren't inherently wrong, even if the execution could be improved. The daughter's reaction is a consequence of the approach, not the necessity of the conversation itself.\n"
