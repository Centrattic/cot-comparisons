Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions she's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the topic. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention is to set boundaries about modesty and respect, which might be part of their values. They were direct and maybe hurt the daughter's feelings. But is that wrong? The other parent isn't supportive, which complicates things. The daughter is in a sensitive age where body image is important. The parent could have handled it more gently, maybe explained the reasons better or considered the daughter's feelings more. However, the act of asking her to dress more appropriately at home isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of approach. The parent might not be in the wrong for the request, but maybe the way they handled it could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the parent is trying to instill values and prevent the daughter from feeling self-conscious, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the daughter is being overly restricted without her feelings being considered, maybe they are. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong because the parent is addressing appropriate behavior, but the approach could be improved. However, the answer options are A or B. Considering the situation, maybe the parent isn't wrong to set reasonable boundaries. So answer B.\n"
