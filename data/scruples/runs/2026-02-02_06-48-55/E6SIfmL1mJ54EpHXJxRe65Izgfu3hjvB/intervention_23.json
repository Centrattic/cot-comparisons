Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explained that the daughter is going through puberty, wears very little at home, and they had a conversation about it. The parent got direct, and the daughter was hurt. The husband didn't support the conversation, and now the daughter is quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. 12 is a typical age for puberty, so body changes are happening. The parent is trying to set boundaries around appropriate dress at home, especially with the father. But is it wrong to ask a child to dress more modestly in their own home?\n\nIn many cultures, parents do set expectations about modesty, especially as children become teenagers. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have been hurtful. The daughter is 12, so she might still be adjusting to her changing body and might not realize that her behavior is inappropriate. The parent's intention is to guide her, but the method could be too harsh. Also, the husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the approach, leading to a lack of support for the parent. \n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe the way they communicated it was inappropriate. The key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable given the situation. Since the daughter is entering adolescence, teaching her about modesty is part of parenting. However, the parent should consider the daughter's feelings and explain things in a more supportive way. The parent's directness might have been too abrupt, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the parent isn't in the wrong for the content of the message but might be in the wrong for the delivery. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong overall. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is B (No), because the parent is not in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if the communication could be improved. The parent's intention was to protect the daughter's modesty and set appropriate expectations as she becomes a young woman. However, the way it was handled could be considered harsh, but the act of setting the boundary itself isn't wrong.\n"
