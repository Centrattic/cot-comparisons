Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions the daughter is going through puberty and walks around in a tank top and underwear or just a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent and avoided the conversation. The parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms and age-appropriate boundaries. At 12, kids are in puberty, so body image and modesty can be sensitive topics. The parent is trying to set boundaries for their daughter's home behavior, which is common. However, the approach might matter. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter is in a stage where she might feel self-conscious or not understand why this is an issue now. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the topic) might contribute to tension.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. But the way it was communicated and the lack of support from the husband could be problematic. The parent might not have considered the daughter's feelings enough, but the core issue of wanting her to dress more appropriately at home isn't necessarily wrong. However, the parent should handle it with more sensitivity, maybe explain gently, and consider discussing with the husband to present a united front. Since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because their intention is to set appropriate boundaries, even if the execution could be improved. The parent isn't wrong for wanting their daughter to be modest, but they could have approached it better.\n"
