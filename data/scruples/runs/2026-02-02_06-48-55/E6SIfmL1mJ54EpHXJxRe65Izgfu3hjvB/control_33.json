Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further. The daughter is now quiet and maybe upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. The parent is trying to set boundaries as their daughter is entering adolescence, which is a common concern. Puberty brings changes, and parents often guide kids on modesty and appropriateness. However, the approach might matter. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter is 12, so emotionally, she's still developing, and her reaction (pouting, being quiet) suggests she felt criticized or embarrassed.\n\nBut then again, the parent is within their rights to set rules about dress in the house. It's a family environment, and parents have the responsibility to teach their children about modesty and respect for others' comfort levels. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) might indicate a different parenting style or discomfort in addressing the issue directly. However, the parent in question isn't necessarily wrong for trying to address the situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent crossed a line. Since the daughter is in a public space (home), the parent's request for her to cover up is reasonable. The method could be improved\u2014maybe a gentler approach to avoid hurting her feelings\u2014but the act of setting this boundary isn't inherently wrong. The parent is trying to prepare her for societal norms and family expectations. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any aspect where the parent overstepped. Since it's within their rights as a parent to set such rules, and the concern is about appropriateness in front of her dad, it's a valid point. So the answer should be B.\n"
