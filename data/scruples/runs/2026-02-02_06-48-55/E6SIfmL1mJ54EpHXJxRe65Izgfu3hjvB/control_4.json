Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel after showers. The parent suggests using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not proper to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. They mention being direct, possibly hurting her feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation, avoiding the topic.\n\nFirst, the parent's concern is about appropriate dress in the home, especially with the father present. But the daughter is 12, so it's a common age for body image issues and self-consciousness. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which could be reasonable. However, the way it was handled might be the issue. Being very direct without considering her feelings could have made her feel embarrassed or criticized. The husband's reaction shows a lack of support, which might add to the daughter's distress.\n\nThe key points are: the parent's intent is to set boundaries, but the approach might be too harsh. The daughter's reaction (being pouty, quiet) suggests she might feel hurt. The parent's explanation about appropriateness is valid, but the method of delivery could be improved. The husband's avoidance of the conversation isn't helpful, but the question is about the parent's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some parents might think it's necessary to address modesty, while others might see it as restrictive, especially at 12. The parent isn't wrong in wanting to teach boundaries, but the execution might be problematic. The daughter's feelings were hurt, so the parent should consider a more empathetic approach. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the concern is valid, but maybe there's room to adjust the method. Alternatively, if the parent's approach was too harsh, then A. But generally, setting appropriate boundaries isn't wrong. The answer is B.\n"
