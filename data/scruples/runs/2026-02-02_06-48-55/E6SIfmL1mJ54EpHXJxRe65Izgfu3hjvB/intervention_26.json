Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. Setting boundaries around modesty at home, especially with a daughter entering puberty, is a common parental concern. The parent is ensuring the daughter understands social norms and respects her body, especially in front of her father. However, the approach might have been too direct or harsh, leading to the daughter's upset.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The parent's intention to set appropriate boundaries, 2) The daughter's age and developmental stage, 3) The communication style (being direct causing hurt feelings), and 4) The husband's reaction.\n\nIs the parent wrong for setting these boundaries? Probably not. But the way they communicated it might have been an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent's action was reasonable but the delivery was harsh, maybe they're not entirely wrong. Alternatively, if covering up at home isn't necessary and the parent is being overbearing, then they might be wrong. But generally, parents do set such boundaries. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but considering the daughter's feelings, maybe A. Hmm. Need to decide based on typical parenting norms. Most parents would agree that teaching modesty is okay, even if the delivery could be softer. So the answer is B.\n"
