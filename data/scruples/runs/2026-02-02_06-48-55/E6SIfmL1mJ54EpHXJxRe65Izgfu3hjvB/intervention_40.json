Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter walks around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not suitable for her being a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband rolled his eyes, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nHmm, so first, the parent is addressing appropriate dress in the home. At 12, puberty is starting, so body image and modesty might be new concerns. The parent's intention is probably to set boundaries, which is reasonable. But maybe the approach was too direct or harsh, causing the daughter to feel upset. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he thought the parent overstepped. However, the parent is trying to teach the daughter about modesty and personal boundaries. The daughter's reaction could be due to the directness rather than the message itself. So, is the parent wrong? Well, the parent isn't wrong for wanting to guide their daughter, but the way it was communicated might have been too blunt. However, the core issue of setting appropriate boundaries isn't wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it more gently.\n"
