Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, and the parent is concerned about her wearing just a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed around her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and changed the subject, leading to the daughter being quiet.\n\nSo, the key points here are: age of the child, cultural norms around modesty, parent's communication style, and the daughter's reaction. The parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the daughter becomes a young woman. However, the way the parent addressed it might have been too direct or harsh, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nIn many cultures, it's considered appropriate for parents to guide children on modesty, especially as they enter puberty. However, the approach matters. Being very direct might not account for the child's feelings. Also, the father's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) might have confused the daughter, not providing the support she needed. \n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but the method could be improved. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the action itself (setting a dress code at home) is within reasonable parental authority, then the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But if the approach was too harsh, maybe A. However, the parent's reasoning is based on the daughter's age and appropriateness around a parent, which is a common concern. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, 12, she's in a stage where body image and parental guidance are sensitive. The parent's explanation was about appropriateness, which is a valid point, but the communication style might have been an issue. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for the action, not the method. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because setting appropriate boundaries is part of parenting. The parent's mistake might be in the communication rather than the action itself.\n"
