Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's in the house. The daughter is in puberty, and the mother asked her to wear a robe or something instead of just a tank top and underwear or a towel. The mother was direct, maybe hurt the daughter's feelings, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, teaching children about modesty is common, especially during puberty. The mother's concern is about appropriateness, given that the daughter is a young woman now. However, the approach might be too direct or harsh for a 12-year-old. The daughter might feel her body is being criticized, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014could indicate a lack of support for the mother's approach. It's possible that the mother's method of communication was too blunt, not considering the daughter's emotional state. Puberty is a sensitive time, and open dialogue is important. The mother might have been right in her intent but wrong in her delivery. The key is whether the mother's actions were harmful or if they were a reasonable effort to teach appropriate behavior. Since the daughter is 12, it's a learning phase, and the mother's intention was to guide her, not to embarrass. However, the way it was said might have caused unnecessary hurt. So, the answer might be that the mother isn't in the wrong in her intent but could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the mother's intention is valid, even if the delivery could be improved, the answer would be B (No). But some might argue that the approach was too harsh for a 12-year-old. Need to balance the intent and the method.\n"
