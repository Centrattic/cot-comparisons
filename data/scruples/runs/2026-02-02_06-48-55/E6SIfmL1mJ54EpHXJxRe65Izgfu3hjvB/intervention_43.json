Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's actions were wrong. From a typical parenting perspective, setting boundaries around modesty, especially during puberty, is common. The parent is addressing a reasonable concern about appropriate behavior in a shared living space. However, the way the parent communicated it might be an issue. They were direct and it hurt the daughter's feelings. Maybe the parent could have approached it more gently, considering the daughter's feelings. But the act of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also a factor. The parent wanted to discuss it with the husband but he avoided it. The parent might be in a situation where they're taking on the role of enforcer without support. However, the parent's right to set house rules still stands. The daughter's age is 12, so she's at an age where such discussions are developmentally appropriate. The key is whether the parent's actions were unreasonable. The parent isn't forcing her to wear specific clothes but suggesting modesty in front of her father. So the parent is likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
