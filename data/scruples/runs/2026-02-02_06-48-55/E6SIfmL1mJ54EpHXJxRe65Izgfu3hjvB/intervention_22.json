Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is going through puberty and often wears minimal clothing, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing appropriately, explaining it's not appropriate in front of her father. The daughter was hurt by this, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and appropriate behavior for a 12-year-old. At 12, puberty is common, and body image discussions are part of parenting. The parent is addressing modesty in the home, which is a valid concern. However, the approach might matter. The parent was direct, which led to the daughter feeling hurt. The father's reaction of eye-rolling and avoiding the conversation could indicate a lack of support for the parent's approach.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries about modesty can be reasonable, especially as children become teenagers. However, the method of communication seems harsh. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings or explain the reasoning in a supportive way. The daughter is at an age where she's developing autonomy, so being overly direct without empathy might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the husband's response isn't helpful. But the question is about the parent's actions. The parent's intention might be good, but the execution could be flawed. The key is whether the parent's actions were unreasonable. Since the parent is trying to guide the daughter into appropriate behavior as she grows up, that's not inherently wrong. However, hurting the daughter's feelings and the lack of support from the husband complicate things.\n\nIn many cultures, parents are expected to teach modesty, but it's important to do so with sensitivity. The parent's approach might be too abrupt, leading to negative reactions. So while the parent isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to address this issue, the way they handled it could be improved. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. If the parent's actions are considered reasonable despite the communication style, then they aren't in the wrong. But if the communication style is what's wrong, maybe they are.\n\nBut the user thinks the parent is in the wrong. They might argue that the parent is overstepping, but at 12, teaching boundaries is part of parenting. I think the parent's actions are not in the wrong because they are addressing a legitimate concern about modesty, but their communication could be better. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
