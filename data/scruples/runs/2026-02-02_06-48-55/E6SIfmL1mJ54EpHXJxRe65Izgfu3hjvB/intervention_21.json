Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who made their 12-year-old daughter cover up at home is in the wrong. The daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel, and the parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent, and the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. 12 is still young, but entering puberty. The parent is concerned about modesty and setting boundaries. But is that reasonable? At home, kids often wear less, but there's a line when it comes to parents. The parent might be trying to protect the daughter from feeling embarrassed if others see her, or setting age-appropriate boundaries. However, being too strict might make the daughter feel criticized, especially during a sensitive time like puberty. The parent's approach was direct, which could have hurt her feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the parent's approach, which might have added to the daughter's distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to teach her about modesty and appropriate behavior as she grows. It's important for children to understand boundaries, but the method here might be too harsh. The parent didn't explain the reasoning well, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. The husband's lack of support could have made things worse.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior, but the way they handled it might be lacking. The key is whether the parent is being reasonable in the context of a 12-year-old. Since the parent's intent is to guide, but the method could be improved, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the parent is overstepping, especially if the daughter is within her rights to wear what she wants at home. But considering the parent's concern about appropriateness and the daughter's age, it's a judgment call. I'll go with B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but could handle it more gently.\n"
