Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent says the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent explained it's not appropriate for a young woman to be half-dressed around her father. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband didn't want to discuss it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. At 12, a girl is entering puberty, so body image and modesty are developing. The parent's concern might be about setting boundaries as the daughter becomes a young woman. However, the home environment is private, and in many cultures, wearing a towel or underwear at home is common. The parent's approach was direct, which might have been too harsh for the daughter's feelings. \n\nThe father's reaction of rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation could indicate a lack of support for the mother's approach. The daughter's silence suggests she's upset. The key points are whether the parent's request is reasonable and if the method was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to teach modesty and respect for boundaries. On the other hand, the daughter is still a child, and public shaming even in a private setting could be hurtful. The parent's explanation makes sense, but the delivery might need to be more empathetic. The husband's avoidance might have left the mother to handle it alone, which could add to the daughter's distress.\n\nI think the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because the intention is to prepare the daughter for societal norms as she grows. However, the approach could have been softer. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on cultural norms and parenting styles. Since the parent is acting in the daughter's best interest but might have mishandled the conversation, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). But some might argue A if they think the parent overstepped. Considering the context, the parent's actions are reasonable but the method could improve. So the answer is B.\n"
