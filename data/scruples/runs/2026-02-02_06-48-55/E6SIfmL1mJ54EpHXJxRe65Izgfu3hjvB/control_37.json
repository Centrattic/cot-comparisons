Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mother is wrong for telling her 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in a house that's kept warm and often wears just a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showering. The mother explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got hurt feelings, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, modesty at home is expected, especially around parents. The daughter is entering puberty, so the mother might be preparing her for societal norms. However, the daughter is still a child, and home is a private space. But the mother's intention is to set boundaries as she becomes a young woman.\n\nThe mother was direct, which might have been harsh. Maybe the daughter felt embarrassed or criticized during puberty. The husband's reaction of rolling eyes suggests he might not agree or think it's not a big issue. But the mother's concern is valid for teaching modesty and boundaries.\n\nHowever, the approach could be improved. Explaining gently and discussing feelings might have been better than being direct. The mother might be right in her intent but wrong in delivery. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is reasonable, but maybe she could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she could have done better. Since her actions are about teaching appropriateness, she's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
