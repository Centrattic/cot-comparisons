Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's at home. The parent mentioned the daughter is going through puberty, wears a tank top and underwear, and sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband was dismissive.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as kids become teenagers. The parent is trying to prepare her for societal expectations, maybe. But 12 is pretty young; is this too early? Also, the parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter might be going through her own changes and feeling self-conscious. The parent's intention is to teach modesty, but the method might be harsh. The husband's reaction not helping probably made the daughter feel unsupported. So, is the parent wrong? Maybe they should have approached it more gently, explained the reasons better, or considered the daughter's feelings more. But the concern about modesty isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it was handled might be. So maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have done it better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer choices are A or B. If the parent's intention is valid but the method could be improved, then maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But if being direct and making the daughter feel she's wrong for her natural behavior is the issue, then A. I think it's a cultural and contextual thing. In many families, parents do discuss modesty with their kids. So the parent isn't necessarily wrong. The daughter's reaction might be due to the way it was said, not the message itself. So answer B.\n"
