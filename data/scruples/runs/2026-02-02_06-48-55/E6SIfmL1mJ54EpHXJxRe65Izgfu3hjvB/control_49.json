Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent talking to their 12-year-old daughter about dressing more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty, and the parent is concerned about her wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent suggested using a robe instead, which led to the daughter feeling upset. The husband didn't support the conversation and changed the subject.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents to address clothing choices for kids as they get older, especially with puberty. However, the daughter is 12, so she's still a child, and the parent's concern might be about modesty and setting boundaries. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction could indicate that he thinks the parent is overreacting or handling it poorly.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent is trying to enforce appropriate behavior, which is part of parenting. However, the way it was communicated might have been too harsh, especially if it made the daughter feel embarrassed. The key points are the age and the method. At 12, children are developing autonomy, so the parent might need a more open discussion rather than a direct command. Also, the husband's non-supportive reaction could have exacerbated the situation. The parent isn't necessarily wrong in addressing the behavior but could have handled it more sensitively. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with considerations on approach.\n"
