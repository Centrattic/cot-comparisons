Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent suggested she use a robe or put something on, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's action was wrong. The key points are the parent's concern about modesty, the daughter's age, and the way the parent communicated the concern. \n\nAt 12, the daughter is entering adolescence, so body image and privacy norms might be more sensitive. Parents often set boundaries for modesty, especially regarding exposure to other adults in the household. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is now a young woman, so dressing appropriately at home matters. However, the approach might have been too direct or harsh, leading to the daughter's hurt feelings. The parent didn't consider the daughter's perspective or involve the husband properly. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes) suggests he might not agree or think the parent overreacted.\n\nBut is the parent wrong entirely? The parent's intention is to teach modesty and set boundaries, which is a common parental role. However, the method could be improved\u2014maybe approaching it with more empathy, discussing it privately, or understanding why the daughter prefers that attire. The parent's directness might have been appropriate in terms of the message but mishandled in delivery. Since the daughter is 12, she's old enough to understand the conversation, but the parent could have been more sensitive to her feelings. The husband's disengagement isn't the parent's fault, but the parent might have handled the situation better by involving him more constructively.\n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely wrong for setting the boundary, but the approach could be improved. The question is whether they were \"in the wrong.\" If \"wrong\" means that the action itself is incorrect, then maybe not. But if it's about the execution, then there's room for improvement. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. Given that the parent's intent is reasonable (modesty), but the delivery might have been harsh, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the concern is valid, but the method could be better. But the daughter's reaction suggests maybe the parent was too abrupt. However, cultural norms around modesty vary, so the parent's stance isn't inherently wrong. So leaning towards B.\n"
