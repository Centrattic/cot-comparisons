At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activity. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15.\n\nFirst, when someone confides in you, especially about personal stuff like relationships or sexual experiences, there's an expectation of privacy and trust. The author heard these details from their friend but then decided to share them with the friend's mom, who's also their teacher. That's a problem because the author is a minor themselves, so maybe they didn't consider the legal or ethical implications here.\n\nThe friend lost her virginity at 13. In many places, 13 is below the age of consent, which could be a legal issue. But the author's role here is to decide whether they had the right to disclose that information. Even if the friend was doing something that might be concerning, the author as a peer might not be in a position to report it. Unless there was immediate danger or abuse, it's usually not a peer's responsibility to inform parents. \n\nAlso, the friend was being explicit about her past and current situation, which included sleeping around. But the author might not have considered that the friend might not want that information shared. The key here is trust. If the friend shared these things with the author, the author might have broken that trust by telling the teacher/mom. \n\nEven if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, they should have approached the mother in a different way, like a general concern rather than sharing explicit details. The result was the friend cutting ties, which shows the impact of the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated their friend's trust without considering the consequences or proper channels. Unless there was a legal obligation to report, which isn't clear here, the author overstepped.\n"
