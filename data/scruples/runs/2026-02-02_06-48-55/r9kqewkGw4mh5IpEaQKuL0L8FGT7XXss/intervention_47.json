At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend told them in detail about sleeping around, and the author told her mom, who is also their teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially something sensitive like that, there's an expectation of privacy. The author was a friend, so trust is involved. Breaking that trust by disclosing private matters without consent is usually a big no-no.\n\nThen there's the age factor. Both the author and their friend are 15, so they're minors. They might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. But the law often treats minors differently, especially in cases involving consent and privacy. However, the legal aspect here isn't just about the author's age but about sharing information about another minor's sexual activities.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they considered their friend's mother's perspective. But even if the mother might be concerned, the author didn't have the authority to act as a parent. It's not their role to decide what the mother should know. The mother might have a right to know if there's abuse or illegal activity, but just having multiple partners isn't against the law. The author's action was a breach of confidentiality without a legal justification.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a key point. The friendship ended because of this, which suggests that the author's action had a significant negative impact. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting the friend's mom, but the method was wrong. The friend had the right to privacy, and the author violated that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was trying to help by informing the mother. However, the appropriate way would be to talk to the mother about their concerns without revealing specific details. The way the author did it was direct and without consent, which is problematic.\n\nLegal and ethical standards usually require that when someone shares confidential information, it's not shared with others unless there's a legal obligation (like imminent harm) or authorization. The author didn't have authorization, so their action was a breach of confidentiality. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
