At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told the friend's mom about her sexual activities because he thought the mom should know. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. Both the author and his friend are 15, which is a minor. In many places, having sex at 15 is illegal if not with legal consent. But the friend lost her virginity at 13, which is definitely underage in most places. However, the age of consent varies by location, so maybe the user didn't consider that. Wait, if the friend was 13, then she was underage, and the people she had sex with could be in trouble. But the author is telling the mom, which might be a report of possible underage sexual activity. \n\nBut the author's friend might have been engaging in consensual activities with peers, but if they're both 15, maybe they're still under the age of consent in some places. The author tells the mom, which could be a protective action. However, the friend might not want that information shared, leading to a breach of trust. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a minor and tells a teacher (the mom) which is an authority figure. Even if he's concerned, did he have the right to disclose personal information without consent? Trust is important in friendships, and breaking that could be seen as wrong. But if there's a legal issue, maybe he's justified. \n\nBut the friend's actions are her own, and unless there's a legal violation being committed against the friend (like exploitation), the author might have overstepped. The friend's mom is a teacher, so the author might have felt responsible, but maybe he should have talked to a trusted adult first instead of the mother directly. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is key. If he was genuinely concerned for the friend's well-being and potential risks, but if the friend's actions weren't illegal and she's in control of her decisions, then the author's actions could be seen as violating her privacy. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent, especially a friend, is a breach of trust. Unless there's a clear and present danger, the author might be in the wrong. Even if he thought the mom should know, the friend might have the right to privacy, especially if her actions aren't illegal. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author told the mom without the friend's permission, leading to the friend cutting ties. The mom is a teacher, so maybe there's a professional obligation to report, but the friend's age and the author's age might complicate that. However, since the author is also a minor, his judgment might not be the best. \n\nIn most ethical considerations, respecting a friend's privacy is important unless there's a legal duty to report. If the friend's actions don't involve exploitation or harm, the author's action was a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
