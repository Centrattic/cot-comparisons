At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his friend's mom about her explicit behavior. \n\nFirst, the friend (15f) shared personal details about her relationships and sexual activities with the author. He kept quiet for a month, then decided to tell the mom. The mom is also his teacher, which might add a layer of authority.\n\nThe author's reasoning was imagining how he'd feel if he were the mom. But did he have the right to share someone else's private information? Trust is a big part of friendships. If you confide in someone, they're supposed to keep it private. By telling the mom, he broke that trust. \n\nAlso, the friend is a minor, so maybe there are legal aspects. But the mom is a teacher, which might involve mandatory reporting laws. Wait, does the friend's behavior (sleeping around, losing virginity at 13) cross into something that needs reporting? If it's within legal age and consensual, maybe not. But if the author isn't a mandatory reporter, then he's overstepping by sharing private info without consent. \n\nThe friend was upset and now avoids him. The author's action led to the loss of the friendship. Even if he thought he was helping, he didn't consider the friend's autonomy. The mom might have overreacted, but the initial breach of confidentiality is on the author. \n\nSo, even if the intention was good, the action of snitching without the friend's consent breaks trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
