At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author in detail that she sleeps around a lot, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the girl's mom, who is also their teacher, which led to the friend cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend shared personal information with the author, which is a trust. By sharing that information, the friend expected confidentiality. The author felt that, from the mother's perspective, it would be important to know, so they reported the details. But the friend is now upset, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nConfidentiality is a big factor. When someone shares something personal, they usually do so under the assumption that it's private. Even if the information is about risky or morally questionable behavior, the boundary is whether the person who told it trusted the listener to keep it secret. The author's decision to inform the mother breaks that trust unless there's a compelling reason, like imminent harm.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author might have felt concerned about the friend's well-being, especially since she's 15. If the friend was engaging in sexual activity at 13, that's underage in most places, so maybe the author thought it was necessary to inform a parent. However, the girl is 15 now, so the past action is still relevant, but the mother is her parent, so she should already be aware of her daughter's activities to some extent. However, the girl might have kept this secret from her mom, and the author's disclosure could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nAnother point is the age of the author. At 15, they might not fully understand the implications of their actions or the concept of trust and privacy. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The action itself\u2014sharing someone else's private information without their consent\u2014is typically considered wrong, regardless of the person's age.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is negative, which makes sense if she trusted the author and now feels betrayed. The author's justification was from the mother's perspective, but the mother is also a teacher and an authority figure. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing an adult, but the mother should already be involved in her daughter's life. Unless there was a specific reason to believe the mother wasn't aware, the author's action still breaches the friend's trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author did the wrong thing by sharing private information that was shared in confidence. Unless there was an immediate danger (which isn't mentioned here), the right action would have been to respect the friend's privacy. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong)."
