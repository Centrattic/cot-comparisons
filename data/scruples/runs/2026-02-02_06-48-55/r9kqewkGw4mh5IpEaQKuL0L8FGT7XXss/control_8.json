At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's sharing explicit details about her relationships with her friend. The author, also a 15-year-old, decides to inform the girl's mom, who's a teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust. When someone shares personal information, especially about their life, it's generally expected that you won't share that with others unless there's a valid reason. The friend didn't ask the author to keep it secret, but it's implied that she trusted him. By going to her mom, he breached that trust.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. He mentions he thought about the mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But is it his place to decide that? Even if he had good intentions, sharing such private details without consent is a violation of privacy. Especially since the girl isn't harming anyone else, just making her own choices, albeit risky for her age.\n\nLegal aspects: The age of consent varies by location, but since the girl is 15, depending on the place, some activities might be legal. However, sharing this information could have consequences for the girl, like family conflict, emotional distress, or even legal issues if it's considered a breach of confidentiality. The author, as a minor, might not be in a position to judge another's actions without consulting proper authorities or a trusted adult first.\n\nImpact on the relationship: The friend now refuses to speak to him. The action has caused a significant rift. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, the method was inappropriate. He should have maybe talked to a counselor or the mother in a more general way instead of revealing explicit details.\n\nEthical considerations: The author assumed the role of a moral arbiter. While he might think the mother has a right to know, the information shared was between peers. Unless there's a risk of harm (like underage sex with someone underage, but that's unclear here), it's not his place to act as a tattle-tale.\n\nPossible alternatives: He could have advised the girl to talk to her parents, or sought help from a teacher or counselor without revealing her secrets. But he chose to directly inform her mom, which is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author violated the friend's trust by disclosing personal information without consent, leading to strained relationships and potential emotional harm. Even with good intentions, the action was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
