At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author in detail about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the girl's mom, who is also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and not talking to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is also 15, so they're minors. The friend shared personal information with the author, possibly trusting them. The author decided to inform the mom, thinking about the mom's perspective and wanting to know if she were in her position. \n\nOne angle is confidentiality and trust. When someone shares personal details, especially about sensitive topics like sex, they usually expect confidentiality. The author broke that trust by telling the mom. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of sharing private information without consent can harm the relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspects. In some places, there are laws about reporting underage sexual activity if there's a suspicion of abuse or harm. However, the friend's actions here are about consensual relationships, even if they're considered risky or inappropriate for her age. The author isn't a legal guardian, so they might not have the authority to make that determination. \n\nThe mom's reaction is also a factor. She initially thought her daughter was lying but later believed the author. The friend is now upset and cutting off the author, which is a direct consequence of the author's action. \n\nIs there a duty to report? If the author had a reason to believe the daughter was in danger or being harmed, then maybe. But the scenario describes the girl talking about sleeping around and previous relationships, not abuse. So the author's action might be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author's motive: trying to see things from the mom's perspective. But that doesn't necessarily justify breaking confidentiality. The author should have considered the trust involved and perhaps discussed concerns with a parent or authority figure first, rather than directly informing the mother. \n\nIn conclusion, the author broke a trust by sharing personal information without the friend's consent, leading to a broken friendship. Even with good intentions, the action was a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
