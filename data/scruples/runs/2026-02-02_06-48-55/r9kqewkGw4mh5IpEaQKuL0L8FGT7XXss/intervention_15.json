At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The person is a 15-year-old guy who told the friend's mom about her sleeping around and losing virginity at 13. The friend is 15 too. \n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially voluntarily, there's an expectation of privacy. The author might have told the mom because he thought it was the right thing, but did he have the right to do that without consent?\n\nNext, the age factor. Both are minors, 15 years old. In many places, the legal age for consent and sexual activity might be higher, so if the friend lost her virginity at 13, there could be legal implications. But the author isn't the one who did anything illegal here; he's the one who reported it. But even so, breaking someone's trust by sharing their secrets without their consent is a big deal.\n\nThe author's reasoning was thinking from the mom's perspective. He thought the mom would want to know. However, the friend might have shared this with him without realizing he would tell someone else. Trust is important in friendships. By revealing her secrets, the author broke that trust, leading to the friend cutting him off. \n\nIs there a duty to report? Maybe if there was a legal concern, like underage sex or abuse, adults might have a responsibility. But since the author is also a minor and the friend is 15, it's unclear if there's a legal obligation. The mom might not have known, but the author didn't have to go to the mom; he could have talked to her first or sought advice from a responsible adult. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior (sleeping around) isn't illegal, just personal and perhaps not something a parent wants to know. The author's action caused the friend's punishment and loss of friendship, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a breach of trust. Even with good intentions, without consent, sharing someone's private information is wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
