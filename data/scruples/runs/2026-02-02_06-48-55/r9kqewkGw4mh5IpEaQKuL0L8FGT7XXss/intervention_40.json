At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, and the mom is also a teacher. The key points here are trust, consent, and the appropriateness of the action.\n\nFirst, the author was confided in by their friend, who shared personal details about her relationships. The author then decided to inform the mother without the friend's consent. That seems like a breach of trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing from the mother's perspective, sharing such private information without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy, especially among peers.\n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, which complicates things. If the author is a student and the teacher is also a parent, there might be a conflict of interest. But the main issue is that the author didn't consider the friend's right to privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of snitching without consent is usually seen as wrong, leading to the friend cutting off communication.\n\nIn many cases, unless there's a legal obligation or imminent harm, sharing someone else's private matters without their consent is considered a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method wasn't appropriate. So, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
