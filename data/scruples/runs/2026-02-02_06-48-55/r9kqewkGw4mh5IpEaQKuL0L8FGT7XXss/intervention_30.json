At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The friend talked about sleeping around a lot, and the author told her mom. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, a guy, and the friend is a girl. They bonded over shared interests. The friend discussed her sexual activities with the author, which he felt compelled to share with her mom, who is also his teacher. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which might be illegal depending on the jurisdiction, but the question is about the ethics of the author's action.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the right to privacy. When someone shares personal information with another person, even a friend, there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't own the information to share; they were entrusted with it. By disclosing it, the author violated that trust. \n\nNow, the author might argue that they were concerned about the friend's well-being, considering her mother's perspective. However, the appropriate action would be to talk to the friend first, maybe express concern, or involve an authority if there's illegal activity, like underage sex. But the author didn't do that; they went straight to the mother, causing a breach of trust and likely emotional harm. \n\nLegal aspects could factor in if there's underage activity, but the ethical angle here is about trust and relationships. The friend might feel betrayed, and the author lost her friendship. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was wrong. The right approach would be to respect confidentiality unless there's an immediate danger, which isn't clearly stated here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they broke the trust of their friend without proper justification. The answer is A.\n"
