At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old boy who confided in his friend about her sexual activities and then told her mom, who's also his teacher. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of friendships. If the friend shared personal stuff with him, expecting privacy, he breached that trust by telling her mom. Even if he had good intentions, like thinking the mom should know, he didn't have the right to share her secrets.\n\nThen there's the legal aspect. Depending on where they are, sharing someone's private information without consent could be an issue. But since they're minors, maybe the school has policies they need to follow. However, the user didn't go through proper channels but instead told the mom directly, which might skip the school's procedures.\n\nThe friend's reaction makes sense too. She was upset and cut him off, which shows the trust was broken. He might have thought he was protecting her by informing her mom, but it's not his place to decide. Parents have the right to know about their children's well-being, but the way he shared explicit details without her consent is problematic.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned sleeping around, but unless there's an actual safety issue (like underage sex, which might be illegal in some places), it's more about personal choice. The user's decision to act on that information without considering the consequences for the friendship and her autonomy makes him the one at fault here.\n\nSo, overall, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he violated his friend's trust and privacy without proper cause or channels.\n"
