At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, shared explicit details about her sleeping around with the author, who is also 15. The author then told the friend's mom, who's a teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially in a friendship, there's an unspoken trust that those details won't be shared with others unless necessary. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to tell her mom, so that's a breach of privacy. \n\nThen there's the age factor. Both the author and the friend are minors, 15 years old. At that age, people are still learning about consent, privacy, and boundaries. The author decided to share something very personal without considering the friend's feelings or the potential consequences. The friend's mom might not be thrilled about her daughter's actions, but the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator, which isn't their role.\n\nAnother point is the author's reasoning. They mentioned trying to see it from the mother's perspective and wanting to inform her. But is that the mother's responsibility? The author assumed the role of a concerned party without being asked. It's possible the mother would handle it differently, or maybe she already knows, but the author's interference led to a breakdown in the friendship.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior\u2014sleeping around at 15\u2014might be a concern, but that's between the girl and her parents. The author's decision to disclose this without consent seems to overstep. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the method was inappropriate.\n\nLegal aspects? Depending on the country, there might be laws about sharing someone's private information without consent. But since they're both minors, it's more about ethical and social considerations here.\n\nThe outcome is that the friend is upset and no longer talks to the author. The author might feel justified, thinking they were protecting the friend's mom, but the harm done to their friendship is significant. The key issue is the lack of consent to share the information. \n\nIn conclusion, the author shared confidential information without the friend's permission, leading to negative consequences. That makes the author in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
