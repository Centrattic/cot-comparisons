At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling the girl's mom about her explicit stories. The scenario is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was sharing details about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, decided to tell the mom because they thought the mom should know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author had the right to share that information. The girl shared personal details with the author, which is a trust. By disclosing that to the mom, the author broke that trust. But maybe the author had a good reason, like protecting the friend or the mom.\n\nHowever, the girl is a minor, so there might be legal implications. If the girl was engaging in sexual activity at 13, that could be statutory rape depending on the jurisdiction. In many places, 13 is below the age of consent, so the author might have a duty to report that. But the author is also a minor, so their responsibility might be different. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author shared explicit details without knowing if the girl's mom was aware. The author's intention was to protect the mom, but maybe they should have spoken to the mom first privately or considered if it was their place to do so. Breaking someone's trust, even with good intentions, can lead to consequences like losing a friend. \n\nAdditionally, the author might have overstepped. The girl's behavior, while concerning, is her personal choice. Unless there's a legal obligation to report, the author's action might be seen as violating confidentiality. However, if there's a legal issue (like underage sex), then the author might be justified. But the example mentions the daughter is 15 now, so losing virginity at 13 would be underage if the partner was an adult. If the author knows about this, they might be obligated to report it. \n\nWait, the daughter is 15 now, so she was 13 when she lost her virginity. If she was having sex with someone 18 or older, that's statutory rape. But if the partner was another minor, maybe 14 or 15, then it's different. The author didn't specify the partner's age. Without that info, the author might be making an assumption. \n\nSo, the author's action could be justified if there's a legal concern, but without knowing the partner's age, it's unclear. Also, the author is a peer; their role isn't to police their friend's behavior. The right approach might have been to talk to the mom privately first or seek advice instead of immediately revealing everything. \n\nIn terms of the friendship, the author caused a rift. Even if the action was well-intentioned, the girl might feel betrayed. The answer hinges on whether the disclosure was necessary and if the author had the right to do so. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they broke the girl's trust without a clear legal duty to report and without considering the personal impact. However, if there was a legal obligation, maybe not. But since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, I should check if statutory rape applies here. If the girl had consensual sex at 13 with someone 18+, then the author might be right to report. But since the author is also a minor and the scenario doesn't clarify the partner's age, it's ambiguous. So, the answer is A.\n"
