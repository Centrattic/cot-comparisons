At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year-old who befriended another girl who started talking about her sexual activities. The author decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also a teacher, about what the girl was saying. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust in friendships. When someone shares personal information, especially voluntarily, there's an expectation that it's confidential. The author heard explicit details about the friend's sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. Even if the author thought it was right from the mother's perspective, sharing that information without consent breaches the trust between friends. \n\nBut wait, the author might argue that they were concerned about the friend's well-being. Maybe they thought the mother should know because the girl was engaging in risky behavior, especially since she was as young as 13. However, the age of consent varies by location, but 13 is generally considered very young in many places. However, the author's role here is complicated because they're the same age as the friend, and they're not a parent or authority figure. \n\nAnother angle is the motive. The author says they tried to see it from the mother's perspective and wanted to inform her. But was the author acting in the mother's best interest or trying to intervene in the friend's behavior? Also, the friend didn't ask the author to tell the mother. The author made the decision unilaterally, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe consequence is that the friendship ended because of this action. The friend is upset, and the author might feel justified, but the act of snitching without the friend's consent is a breach of trust. Friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to report something dangerous. Since the author is the same age and not a parent, there's no such obligation here. \n\nAdditionally, the author shared explicit details, which could be seen as harsh. Even if the mother believed the author later, the method of disclosure might have caused unnecessary harm. The author might not have considered the friend's autonomy or her relationship with her mother. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the action of informing the mother without the friend's consent likely breached trust and overstepped boundaries. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
