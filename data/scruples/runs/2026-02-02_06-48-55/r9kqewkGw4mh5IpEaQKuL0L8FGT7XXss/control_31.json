At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether they snitched on their friend by telling her mom about her explicit details of her sexual activities. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a 15-year-old who became friends with a girl in their class. They shared common interests and had open conversations. The friend started talking about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13 and having a FWB (friends with benefits) situation. The user initially didn't care but then considered her mother's perspective and decided to inform her mother, a teacher, in explicit detail. This led to the friend cutting off the user.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're the asshole for snitching. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me think about the key points here. The user confided in their friend, and the friend shared personal information. The user then took that confidential information and told her mother, a teacher. The mother is also a teacher, so there's a professional relationship there. \n\nIn terms of trust, when someone shares personal information, especially about their private life, it's generally expected that it stays confidential unless there's a risk to their safety. The user felt that the mother needed to know because they thought it was in the mother's best interest. But is that a valid reason?\n\nAt 15 years old, both the user and the friend are minors. Sexual activity at 13 is legally under the age of consent in many places (assuming a US context, where the age of consent is typically 16 or 18). However, the user wasn't reporting illegal activity per se\u2014just the behavior. The user's friend might be engaging in behavior that a parent might consider inappropriate, but that doesn't necessarily make the user's action the right one. \n\nThe user's motivation was concern for the mother's perspective. However, the user wasn't the parent and didn't have the authority to make that decision. Sharing someone's private information without their consent, even if well-intentioned, can be a breach of trust. The friend's reaction (cutting off the user) suggests that she felt betrayed. \n\nThere's a difference between protecting someone and respecting their confidentiality. The user might have thought they were helping, but they didn't consider if the mother needed to know. In some cases, parents have the right to know about their child's behavior, but the child also has a right to privacy. The user's action was a breach of trust, which is why the friend is upset. \n\nAdditionally, the user is a peer, not an authority figure. Teachers can sometimes be mandated reporters for certain issues (like abuse), but here it's about the user's judgment call. The user didn't have a legal obligation to report unless there was a specific policy that required it, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, the main factors are: breach of trust, the user's role as a peer, and the lack of clear harm or legal issue. Even if the user had good intentions, the act of sharing personal information without consent is generally considered a violation of trust. Therefore, the user is in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
