At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 15-year-old boy who became friends with a girl (15f) because they have a lot in common. Over time, the girl told him in detail about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The author decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also his teacher, all the explicit details. Now the girl is angry and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age here. Both the author and the girl are 15, which is a minor age, and they're in high school. The girl's mother is also their teacher, which is a bit unusual, but maybe in this context, the teacher is a family friend or something. The key issue is whether the author had the right to disclose the girl's personal information to her mother without consent.\n\nConfidentiality is a big part of friendships. If someone tells you something private, there's an unspoken agreement that you won't share it unless there's a compelling reason. The author's reasoning was that he thought the mother would want to know, considering the girl's age and the nature of her activities. But does that justify breaking her trust?\n\nThe girl might be engaging in sexual activity that, depending on the location, could be legal if she's 15 and the age of consent is lower (like 16 in some places), but if she's with someone older, that could be illegal. However, the author isn't reporting a crime; he's sharing information about her behavior. The mother might have concerns about her daughter's well-being, but the author bypassed the girl and went straight to her mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the author's role as a student and the mother's role as a teacher adds another layer. Telling a teacher, who is also a parent, might be seen as crossing a line because the teacher might take it seriously and involve the school or authorities. The girl's reaction being to cut off the friendship makes sense because she felt betrayed.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author was trying to help by informing the mother, but the method was wrong. The right approach would be to talk to the girl about his concerns first or maybe involve a trusted adult, but not the parent directly without consent. The author didn't seek to mediate or support the friend; he disclosed private information, which is a violation of trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong because he betrayed the friend's trust without just cause, even if his intentions were to protect her. The decision to share such personal information without the friend's consent is a breach of confidentiality in the friendship. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
