At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves the friend sharing explicit details about her sexual behavior, and the author deciding to tell the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is 15, same as the author. They became friends through shared interests, and the friend disclosed personal information about her relationships. The author then felt that, from the mom's perspective, it would be important to know, so they told the mom. The result was that the friend is upset and no longer talks to the author.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author had the right to share that information. Privacy is a big factor here. The friend confided in the author, expecting some level of confidentiality. By sharing this with the mom, the author violated that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing for the mom's sake, they didn't consider whether the friend wanted that information shared. \n\nAnother angle is the age of the individuals. At 15, they're minors, so there might be arguments about parental responsibility. However, the friend didn't share this with her mom, so the author's decision to do so without her consent is a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend lost her virginity at 13. While that might be a concern for a parent, the author's role as a friend is to respect boundaries unless there's a legal obligation or imminent harm. Since there's no indication of harm here, just personal choices, the author overstepped by informing the mom.\n\nThe consequences are clear: the friendship ended. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method was inappropriate. Trust is crucial in friendships, and once broken, it's hard to rebuild. \n\nIn summary, the author violated the friend's privacy and trust without a valid reason, leading to the loss of the friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
