At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling his friend's mom about her sleeping around. The friend is 15, same age as the author.\n\nFirst, the friend confided in the author about her sexual activities. That's a private matter. The author decided to share this with the mom, who's also a teacher. The key points here are trust and consent. The friend didn't give permission for the author to share her private info. By doing so, the author broke her trust, which led to the friend cutting ties.\n\nEven if the author thought he was doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, he didn't have a legal obligation to report this. The mother-teacher might have a duty to report certain things, but the author isn't in that position. His action was based on personal judgment, not a legal requirement.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's autonomy. At 15, she's a minor, so the parents do have some authority. But the friend chose to share with a peer, not an adult. The author stepping in could be seen as overstepping, especially since the friend didn't ask for intervention. The result is a broken friendship, which is a significant consequence for the author's action.\n\nIn most cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a breach of trust, regardless of the intent. The author's action caused harm to the relationship and possibly the friend's reputation. So, while intentions might have been to protect the mother, the method was inappropriate.\n"
