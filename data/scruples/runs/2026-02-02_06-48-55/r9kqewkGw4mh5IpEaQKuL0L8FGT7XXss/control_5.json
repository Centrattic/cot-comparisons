At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 15-year-old girl told the author, who is also 15, explicit details about her sexual activity and losing her virginity at 13. The author then told her mom, who is also a teacher, which led to the friend cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author overheard a personal conversation and used it to decide to inform the mom. But wait, the friend told the author directly, right? The author didn't just overhear. So, the friend confided in the author, which might imply trust. The author then broke that trust by sharing the information with her mother. \n\nNow, the friend is 15, so she's a minor. The mother might have a right to know about her daughter's activities, but the author is the same age. The question is, is it the author's place to act as a parent or authority figure here? In some cases, people might feel it's their responsibility to protect a friend by informing a parent if they think the friend is in danger. However, the friend was discussing her own choices, not necessarily something illegal or harmful. \n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. The author was entrusted with personal information, and sharing it without the friend's consent is a breach of confidentiality. Even if the author thought the mother should know, there are other ways to approach it, like discussing it with the friend first or maybe with a trusted adult rather than the mother directly. \n\nAlso, the author's motive is important. They mentioned trying to see it from the mother's perspective and thinking they'd want to know. But does that justify breaking the friend's trust? Maybe not. The friend might have a right to privacy, and the author should respect that unless there's a clear risk of harm. \n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions (sleeping around) might be considered inappropriate by some, but as a 15-year-old, she's likely making her own choices. The author's decision to inform the mother could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's a personal matter. \n\nSo, the author likely is in the wrong because they broke a trust and shared private information without justification. Unless there was a safety issue, which isn't mentioned here, the friend's privacy should be respected. The answer would be A.\n"
