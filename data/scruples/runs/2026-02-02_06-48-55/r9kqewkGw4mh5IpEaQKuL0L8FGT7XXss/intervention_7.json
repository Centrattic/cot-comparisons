At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The scenario is a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom (who's also his teacher) that his friend sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are: the friend was sharing personal information, the author decided to tell her mom, and the mom believed him, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nFrom a confidentiality standpoint, the friend told the author things in confidence. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, sharing that information without consent could be a breach of trust. The age of the friend is 15, so she's a minor, and the mother might have a right to know if there's something concerning. But here, the issue is about the friend's sexual activity, which is a personal matter. The mother might have her own views on that, but the author stepping in to report it could be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was that he put himself in the mother's shoes and thought the mother would want to know. However, that doesn't necessarily justify disclosing private conversations. The author might have thought he was protecting the friend, but the friend's reaction shows that she felt betrayed. The friendship was based on mutual trust, and breaking that trust can have serious consequences.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In many places, minors have certain rights, and sharing personal information about another minor could be considered a privacy violation unless there's a legal obligation to report something dangerous. Since the situation here is about consensual relationships, there's no clear legal duty to inform the parent. It's more of a moral or ethical issue.\n\nThe author's actions led to the friend cutting off communication, which is a significant negative outcome. Even if the author's intention was good, the method was problematic. The right to privacy, especially for teenagers, is important. The author didn't consider that his friend might not want her mother involved, and he didn't talk to her about it first. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. He violated the friend's confidence, acted without her consent, and caused harm to their relationship. Even with good intentions, keeping others' secrets is a responsibility when they share personal information.\n"
