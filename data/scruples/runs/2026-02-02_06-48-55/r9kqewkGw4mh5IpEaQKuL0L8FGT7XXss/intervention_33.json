At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 15-year-old girl is sharing details about her sexual activities with her friend, the author. The author then tells the girl's mother, who is also their teacher, all the explicit details, including losing her virginity at 13. The friend got upset and stopped talking to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of confidentiality in friendships. When someone shares personal information, especially something as sensitive as sexual history, they usually expect it to stay private. The author didn't ask for permission to share this info, so that's a red flag. Even if the author had good intentions, like thinking the mother should know, it's not the friend's place to decide that. The mother is the parent and might already be aware or have her own way of handling it. \n\nNext, the age and maturity aspect. Both the author and the friend are 15, which is pretty young. At that age, kids are still learning about privacy and boundaries. The author might not fully understand the consequences of sharing such information. Also, the friend was open about her actions, but that doesn't mean others have the right to spread that info. \n\nThere's also the question of why the author did it. They mentioned trying to see it from the mother's perspective, which implies they thought it was for the mother's benefit. However, the mother is the parent, so she already has a role in overseeing her daughter's life. The friend might be in a situation where she's not being responsible, but the author's action of snitching could have caused harm to their friendship and possibly embarrassed or hurt the friend. \n\nAnother point is that the friend's mother started to believe the author, leading to the mother's reaction. The author might not realize that their disclosure could lead to the mother acting in ways the friend finds invasive or harmful. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend or the mother, it's important to consider the friend's autonomy and right to privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend sleeps around and the author felt it was their place to inform the mother. Unless there's a legal obligation to report something (like underage sex being illegal in some places, but I'm not sure), the author is overstepping. The friend might not have wanted her mother to know, even if the mother is a teacher. \n\nI should also think about the impact. The friend is now cutting off the author, which is a natural consequence. The author might feel justified, but the breach of trust is significant. Friendships are built on trust, and breaking that can lead to the relationship ending. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author shared private information without consent, which is a violation of trust. Even if their intention was to protect the friend's mother, they shouldn't be the one to decide what to share. The friend has the right to her privacy, and the author's action was a breach of that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
