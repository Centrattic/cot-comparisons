At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his friend's mom about her sleeping around. The friend is 15, same age as him. They became friends because they had common interests. The friend started talking about her relationships, including losing her virginity at 13 and her current plans to sleep with her BFF (a guy). The author, after considering from the mom's perspective, told the mom, leading to the friend cutting him off.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author shared private information given in confidence. The friend's actions might be risky or inappropriate, but the author didn't consult her directly or report it to an authority. Instead, he told the mom, which is a parent, so maybe justified? But the friend might have considered it a breach of trust. At 15, they're minors, and parents have a right to be informed about their child's behavior. However, the friend might see it as betrayal. The author didn't know if the mom was already aware. Also, telling explicit details could be seen as overstepping. The mom might have a right to know, but the method of disclosure is questionable. The author's intention was to protect, but the friend's trust was broken. In terms of right vs. wrong, it's a gray area. But in many contexts, sharing someone's private info without consent is a breach of trust. So even if the action was well-intentioned, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's confidentiality. So answer A.\n"
