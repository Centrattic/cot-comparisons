At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom about her explicit conversations about sleeping around. The friend is also 15, and they became close because they shared common interests. The author started talking to the girl, they bonded over various topics, and then she started sharing details about her sexual experiences. The author decided, after considering the mother's perspective, to inform the mother. Now the friend is upset and no longer talks to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is confidentiality and trust. The girl shared personal information with the author, trusting that he wouldn't spread it. By telling the mother, he broke that trust. Even if his intention was to protect the girl or the mother, the means of doing so without her consent could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. Both are teenagers, and their judgment might not be fully mature. The author might feel he's acting responsibly, but intervening in someone else's life without their consent can have negative consequences. The friend's autonomy is important; she has the right to make her own choices, even if others disagree.\n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher here, which complicates things. The author approached the mother, possibly thinking the teacher would handle it appropriately. However, the mother's reaction led to a breakdown in the friendship. The author didn't consult the girl directly or try to address the issue with her first. Instead, he went straight to the mother, which might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of sharing private information without consent is typically seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the method might not justify the outcome. The friend's right to privacy and autonomy should be respected. The author's actions caused harm to the friendship and potentially to the girl's relationship with her mother. So, the author is in the wrong because he violated the trust and privacy of his friend without her consent, even if his intentions were to protect.\n"
