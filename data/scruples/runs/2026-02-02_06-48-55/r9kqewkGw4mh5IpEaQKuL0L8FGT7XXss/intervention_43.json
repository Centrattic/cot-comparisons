At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that a 15-year-old girl told her new friend (the author) in detail about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the girl's mom, who's also their teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially in a trusting relationship, there's an expectation that it stays private. The author broke that trust by informing the mother. Even if the author had good intentions, like thinking the mom deserved to know, the friend didn't consent to that information being shared. \n\nThen there's the question of the friend's age. If the girl is a minor, certain actions might be illegal, like having sex under the age of consent, which varies by location. However, the author isn't the authority to report that; that would be the parent's responsibility. But the author isn't the parent, so intervening without the friend's consent could be problematic. \n\nThe author's reasoning was trying to see it from the mom's perspective. But the mom and dad would be the ones to address their daughter's behavior. The author overstepped by acting as a go-between. The friend might feel betrayed because her private matters were disclosed without her permission. \n\nLegal aspects might play a role too. Depending on the jurisdiction, there could be laws about reporting underage sexual activity, but again, the author isn't obligated to report unless there's a suspicion of abuse or harm. Since the friend isn't being harmed, just making choices the author disapproves of, reporting her is a breach of trust. \n\nThe aftermath is that the friend is upset and no longer talks to the author. The author might believe they did the right thing for the friend's well-being, but the method was flawed. The key issue is consent and respect for privacy. The author should have discussed concerns with the friend first or maybe with a trusted adult, but not her parent without her consent. \n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, the act of snitching without the friend's consent was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
