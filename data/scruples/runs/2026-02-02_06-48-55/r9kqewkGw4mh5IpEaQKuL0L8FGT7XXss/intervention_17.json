At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tattling on his friend to her mom. The friend told him about her sexual activities, and he decided to inform her mom, which led to the friend cutting him off. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal details with you, especially a friend, there's an expectation of privacy. The author was entrusted with this information, and by telling the mom, he broke that trust. Even if he had good intentions, like thinking the mom should know, the act of sharing private details without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the friend's age. Both the author and the friend are 15, which is a minor. The legal age of consent in the US varies by state, but generally, 15 is below the age of consent in many places. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, that could be statutory rape depending on the local laws. However, the author isn't a parent or authority figure, so his role here is more about personal responsibility and friendship.\n\nThe author's reasoning was considering the mom's perspective, but even so, it's not his place to decide when to involve a parent. Friends should confide in each other, and if there's a concern, it's better to talk to the parent directly or seek advice from a trusted adult, not just go ahead and spill all the details. Plus, the friend might have shared this information without realizing the implications, and the author's action forced her to face consequences she wasn't prepared for.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their friendship. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing, but the method was wrong. Instead of informing the mom, he could have tried to support his friend or encourage her to talk to someone else if needed. By taking it upon himself, he overstepped his role as a friend.\n\nAlso, the act of sharing explicit details could be seen as violating the friend's privacy. Even if the topic is sensitive, the way he handled it was direct and without the friend's consent. The friend might not have wanted her mom to know, and the author's action caused harm to their relationship.\n\nIn summary, the author violated trust, breached confidentiality, and acted without considering the friend's autonomy. Even with good intentions, the method was wrong. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
