At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's talking about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, decided to tell the friend's mom, who is a teacher. Now the friend is upset and no longer talks to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, so maybe there are different expectations about their understanding of privacy and responsibility. The friend was sharing personal information, which the author took upon themselves to report. But is that the friend's private information to share, or is it something the author should have kept confidential?\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality, consent to share information, and the potential consequences. When someone confides in you, especially about sensitive topics, there's an expectation that the information will be kept private unless there's a legal obligation to report. However, in this case, the author isn't a parent or a legal authority. They decided to inform the mother based on their own judgment.\n\nThe age of the individuals is also important. At 15, they might not have the maturity to fully understand the implications of their actions. The friend shared her experiences, and the author took it upon themselves to act as a concerned person, which is commendable in some ways. But the method of handling it\u2014without consulting the girl's parent first or perhaps discussing it with a trusted adult\u2014might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author told the mother in explicit detail, leading to the mother believing the daughter was making things up at first, but then believing the author, could have caused unnecessary harm. The friend now refuses to talk to the author. So, the action led to a breakdown of trust between friends.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the information shared by the friend was private. Unless there was immediate harm or illegal activity, the author shouldn't have disclosed it without consent. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, they crossed a boundary by violating her privacy. The mother being a teacher might add a layer where the teacher might have a duty to report certain things, but the author isn't obligated to do that. They chose to take it upon themselves, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nHowever, there's a line between privacy and safety. If the friend was engaging in risky behavior, maybe there's a case for intervention. But since the friend is 15, she's a minor, and the mother is her parent. The author might have thought the mother should know, but the way it was handled\u2014without the friend's knowledge or consent\u2014could be the issue. The friend's autonomy is important, even if her actions are something the author disagrees with.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong for breaching the friend's trust without a valid reason beyond their own judgment. They didn't involve any authority figures properly and instead took it upon themselves to act as a tattletale, which damaged their friendship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
