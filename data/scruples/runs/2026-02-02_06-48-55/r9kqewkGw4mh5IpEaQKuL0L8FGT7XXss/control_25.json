At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl talking about her sexual activities, and the author, another 15-year-old boy, told her mom, who's also his teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend mentioned she sleeps around a lot, even losing her virginity at 13. The author thought about her mother's perspective and decided to inform her. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a breach of trust here. The friend confided in the author, and he shared that information without her consent. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing for the mother's concern, the act of sharing private information without permission is a key issue. \n\nAlso, the friend's age is 15, which is a minor, so there's a responsibility for adults to ensure their safety. However, the author is also a minor, so his role might be different. The mother is a teacher, which adds a layer of authority. But the author's decision to meddle in the friend's personal life could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she might feel betrayed. Trust is crucial in friendships, and breaking it can lead to the friendship ending. The author might have had good intentions, but the means of sharing private info without consent is problematic. \n\nLegally, even if the mother is a teacher, the author's disclosure might not be protected, but ethically, the breach of confidentiality is a big issue. The author didn't consult with the friend first or seek advice, just acted on his own. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he violated the friend's privacy and trust, even with good intentions. The answer would be A.\n"
