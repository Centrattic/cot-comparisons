At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user, a 15-year-old guy, met a girl in class who they had a lot in common with. The girl talked a lot about her past relationships and her current situation with a friend who is a guy. He decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, the explicit details he overheard. Now the friend is mad and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the author violated the friend's privacy. The girl shared personal information with him, and he passed it on without her consent. Even if he thought he was doing the right thing, sharing such details with her mom breaches trust. \n\nHe mentions he considered her mom's perspective and thought the mom would want to know. But the key point is that he didn't approach the girl's mom directly to express concerns; instead, he shared the information with the mom in a way that could be seen as snitching. The girl's mom might have been in a better position to handle the situation if approached respectfully, but the author's method might have been more about his own discomfort than seeking help.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable because personal info, especially about relationships and sex, is sensitive. The author didn't have the authority to disclose that, even if he felt it was for her own good. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong for snitching without consent.\n"
