At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old boy who became friends with a girl in his class. They bonded over shared interests. The girl started talking about her previous relationships and how she enjoys having sex without being in a relationship. After a month, the author decided to tell her mom (who is also his teacher) all the explicit details, including that the girl lost her virginity at 13. The mom initially thought the daughter was making things up but later believed the author. The friend now refuses to talk to him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The main issue is confidentiality and trust in a friendship. The author heard personal information from his friend and then shared it with her mother without her consent. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, sharing someone's private details without their permission is a breach of trust. \n\nAt 15 years old, both the author and the friend are minors, and their actions might be seen through the lens of their maturity level. However, the act of disclosing someone's private information, even if well-intentioned, can be considered a violation of privacy. The mother is also a teacher, which might complicate things because teachers can be seen as figures of authority, but the fact that the information came from the student might still be problematic.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that he put himself in the mother's shoes and thought she would want to know. But the friend's autonomy and right to privacy are important factors. Unless there was a legal obligation to report (like if the girl was in danger or underage, but she's 15 and had sex, which in some places might be a legal issue if the partner was an adult, but the scenario doesn't specify that), the author's action was a breach of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction is to cut off the author, which is a natural consequence of such a betrayal. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, focusing only on the mother's potential reaction. \n\nIn most cases, sharing private information without consent is a breach of trust, making the author the asshole here. The key points are confidentiality, consent, and the impact on the friendship. Even if the intention was to protect the friend by informing her mother, the method was inappropriate without the girl's consent. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
