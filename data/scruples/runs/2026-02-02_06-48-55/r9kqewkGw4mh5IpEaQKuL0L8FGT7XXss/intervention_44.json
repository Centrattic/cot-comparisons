At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that a 15-year-old boy told his friend's mom (who is also his teacher) about the friend's explicit details about sleeping around and losing her virginity at 13. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially in a friendship, there's an unspoken agreement that it will stay private. The author of the Reddit post broke that trust. Even though he might have thought he was doing the right thing by informing the mother, the friend wasn't in trouble or in danger, just sharing her own experiences. \n\nNext, the intent matters. The author says he considered the mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But is it his place to act as a go-between? The mother is a teacher, so there's a professional relationship here. Maybe the author should have approached the situation differently, like talking to the mother first before jumping to conclusions. However, the friend shared the information with him, not the mother, so he had no right to pass it on without her consent.\n\nAlso, the age factor is important. Both the author and the friend are minors, so the context is high school. The author might feel conflicted because of their friendship, but sharing such private details without consent is a breach of trust. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she feels betrayed. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's role. Since the mother is a teacher, maybe there's a school policy about reporting certain things. But the friend isn't in immediate harm; she's just talking about her sexual experiences. Unless there's a legal issue (like underage sex), the author overstepped by sharing that information. In many places, 15-year-olds engaging in consensual relationships aren't illegal, so the author might have caused unnecessary trouble for the friend.\n\nIn summary, the author violated the friend's trust by sharing her private information with the mother. Even if his intention was to protect the mother, he didn't have the right to do so without the friend's consent. The correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
