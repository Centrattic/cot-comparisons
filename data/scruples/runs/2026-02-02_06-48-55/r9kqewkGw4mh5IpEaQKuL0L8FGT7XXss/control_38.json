At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, same age as the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust. Friends usually expect that personal information stays between them. The author overheard explicit details about her friend's sex life and decided to share it with her mom, who's also a teacher. That's a breach of trust, right? Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, sharing such private info without consent is a big deal.\n\nThen there's the question of the friend's age. She's 15, which in many places is a minor. Parents have a right to know about their child's well-being, but does that extend to sexual activity? It depends on the laws and the situation. If the friend is engaging in risky behavior, maybe the author felt a duty to inform the parent. But the problem is, the author might not be in a position to judge what's appropriate. The friend might not want her mom to know, even if the mom could be concerned.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. They said they tried to see it from the mom's perspective and wanted to know if they were in that situation. But did they consider the friend's feelings? The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore. That's a consequence of the author's actions. \n\nIn some places, teachers have a duty to report certain things if there's a risk involved, but the author isn't a teacher here. The mom is a teacher, but the author isn't in a position to decide that information should be shared. \n\nSo, even if the intention was to help, sharing private information without consent is generally wrong. The author broke trust, which is a key part of a friendship. The friend's privacy was violated. Unless there was a legal obligation or imminent harm, the author shouldn't have done that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
