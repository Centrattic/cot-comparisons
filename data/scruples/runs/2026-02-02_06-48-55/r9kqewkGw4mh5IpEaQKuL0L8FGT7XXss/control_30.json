At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl sharing explicit details about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13, to her friend. The friend then told the girl's mom, who is also a teacher. The friend is now upset and avoiding the person who snitched.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both the friend and the person who told are 15, so minors. In many places, sharing such information about a minor could be a breach of privacy, especially if the friend didn't consent. The person who told might have thought they were protecting the friend's mom, but they might not have the right to disclose private details without consent.\n\nAlso, the friend's mom is a teacher, which adds a layer. The teacher might have a duty to report certain things, but the student (the person who told) isn't a teacher, so their responsibility isn't as clear. The friend's actions might be morally questionable to some, but the act of snitching without consent invades privacy. The person who told might have thought it's for the friend's own good, but that doesn't necessarily justify sharing personal information. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. Once you break someone's trust by revealing their private matters, especially if they didn't ask you to, it can damage the relationship. The friend lost her privacy and now the relationship is ruined. The person who told might not be in the wrong if they had a legal obligation, but since the mom is a teacher and not a legal guardian in this context, maybe the person overstepped. \n\nIn terms of legality, depending on the country, sharing someone's private information without consent can be a violation of their rights, even among minors. The fact that the friend was talking about her past relationships doesn't give the other person the right to disclose that to others. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person who snitched likely broke trust and invaded privacy. Even if their intentions were to warn the mom, doing so without the friend's consent makes them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
