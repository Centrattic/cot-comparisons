At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking a lot about sleeping around, and the author told her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a 15-year-old boy, same age as the friend. They became friends because they had common interests. The friend was sharing personal details about her sexual activities, which the author found concerning. He waited a month before informing the mom, considering the mother's perspective. The mom initially thought the daughter was making it up but later believed him. The friend is now upset about the betrayal.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality, consent, and the appropriateness of the action. When someone shares personal information, there's an expectation that it stays between them unless there's a risk of harm. The author's action was to share this information with the mother without the friend's consent. \n\nBut wait, in some cases, if there's a concern about a minor's well-being, reporting to a parent or authority might be justified. However, the friend is 15, so both are minors. The author's role here is tricky. The mother is also a teacher, which might have influenced his decision. However, the mother isn't a parent in this context, but her role as a teacher might have different boundaries.\n\nThe problem is that the author took it upon himself to disclose personal information without considering the trust in the friendship. Even if he thought he was acting in the mother's best interest, he violated the friend's privacy. The friend might not have intended for that information to be shared, which is why she's upset. \n\nAlso, the age of consent and legal aspects vary by location, but since the friend lost her virginity at 13, if she's 15 now, there's a possible legal issue if she's under the legal age of consent. However, the author's responsibility here isn't clear. If the author is aware of illegal activity, there might be an obligation to report, but again, the friend is a peer, not someone in a position of authority.\n\nIn most cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent breaches trust. Even if the motive was concern, the action was a betrayal. The author didn't address it directly with the friend first or seek advice from a responsible adult. Instead, he directly informed the mother, which might have been impulsive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author did violate the friend's trust and privacy. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
