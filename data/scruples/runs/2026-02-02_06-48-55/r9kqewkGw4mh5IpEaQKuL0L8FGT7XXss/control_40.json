At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who snitched) is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl talking openly about her sexual activities with her friend, who then tells her mother, also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. Friends usually expect some level of privacy. Sharing personal details like losing virginity at 13 and sleeping around is pretty sensitive. By telling the mother, the author breached that trust. Even if the mother is a teacher, the friend didn't give permission for that information to be shared. \n\nNext, the author's reasoning: they thought they were protecting the friend's mother. But is that a valid reason? Minors might not always understand the consequences, but it's the mother's responsibility to set boundaries. The friend's actions, while concerning, are her choices. The author isn't in a position to decide what the mother needs to know, especially since the mother wasn't present during the conversations. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a clue. She stopped talking to the author, which shows the trust was broken. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of informing the mother without consent was wrong. The author should have approached the mother differently, maybe through proper channels rather than sharing explicit details from a private conversation. \n\nLegally, there's no law against sharing this information, but ethically, it's a breach of trust. The author overstepped by not seeking guidance first or involving the mother in a way that respects the friend's privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a violation of the friend's confidentiality and trust, making them the asshole.\n"
