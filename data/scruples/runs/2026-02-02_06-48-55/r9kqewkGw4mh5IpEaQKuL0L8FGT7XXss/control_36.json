At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who snitched on their friend to her mom because she was talking about sleeping around. The friend is also 15, and the mother is a teacher. The user felt like they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, but the friend is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and consent. The friend shared personal information with the user, expecting some level of privacy. By reporting this to the mother, the user breached that trust. Even if the user had good intentions, sharing such details without consent is a problem.\n\nNext, legal and ethical aspects. In many places, minors can have their own privacy rights, and sharing information about another person's sexual activity without their consent could be an issue. However, since the mother is also a teacher, there might be school policies about reporting certain behaviors, but sleeping around isn't necessarily reportable unless there's underage sex involved. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which is legal in some places but might be a concern for the mother regardless.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect. The user and friend were close, sharing common interests. By snitching, the user destroyed the friendship. While the user might have thought they were protecting the friend, it's a big decision to involve a parent, especially without discussing it with the friend first.\n\nPossible alternatives: Maybe the user should have talked to the friend about their concerns instead of immediately going to the mother. Or advised the friend about the risks of her behavior without exposing her. But the user didn't do that; they went straight to the parent.\n\nAlso, the user's age plays a role. At 15, they might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. However, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the user likely breached trust without a valid reason beyond their own judgment. Unless there was a legal obligation to report (which isn't indicated here), sharing personal information without consent is generally wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
