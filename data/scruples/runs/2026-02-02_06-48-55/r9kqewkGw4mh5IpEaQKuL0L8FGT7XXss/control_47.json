At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old guy who became friends with a girl in his class. They had a lot in common and talked a lot. The girl mentioned she likes having sex without being in a relationship, talked about her past relationships, a FWB (friends with benefits) breakup, and that she's trying to get with her BFF who's a guy. The author kept quiet for a month but then thought about how the girl's mom would feel if she knew. So he told her mom (who is also his teacher) all the explicit details, including the girl losing her virginity at 13. The mom initially thought the daughter was lying but later believed the author. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him. The question is whether the author is the asshole for snitching.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author shared private information that the friend told him in confidence. The friend wasn't in a relationship but was engaging in sexual activity, which the author found concerning and thought the mother should know. The author's intent was to protect, thinking from the mother's perspective. However, the action involved breaching the friend's privacy and trust without her consent.\n\nIn many cases, even if the intent is good, sharing someone's private information without their permission can be seen as violating trust. The friend might have shared those details under the assumption that they were confidential. The author didn't confront the friend first or try to address his concerns directly with her. Instead, he went to the mother, which could be seen as a betrayal of their friendship. \n\nAdditionally, the author's age (15) might be a factor, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. The issue here is about privacy and trust. Even if the mother is a teacher, the author had a responsibility to maintain the friend's confidentiality unless there was an imminent risk or harm, which isn't clearly stated here. The girl's actions, while perhaps risky or against her parents' wishes, don't necessarily endanger others or herself in a way that requires immediate disclosure. \n\nThe outcome was that the friend is now upset and the friendship ended. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing, but the method of handling it was problematic. There's a difference between seeking advice on how to address a concern and directly reporting personal information without consent. The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or change her behavior, which could have been a better approach.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely breached the friend's trust and privacy without a valid reason, making him the asshole in this situation.\n"
