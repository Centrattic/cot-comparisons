At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, a 15-year-old guy, made friends with a girl in their class. They bonded over shared interests, and she started talking to him about her relationships and that she likes to sleep around. He kept quiet for a month but then decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, about her explicit details, including losing her virginity at 13. Now his friend is upset and refuses to talk to him. The question is whether he's the asshole for snitching.\n\nHmm. First, let's break down the key points. The friend shared personal and private information with him. They were friends, so there's an expectation of trust. When someone shares something personal, even if it's something you disagree with, the default is usually to keep it confidential unless there's a clear danger or harm involved. \n\nHe mentions that he thought about it from the mother's perspective and felt he would want to know if he were in her position. But is it his place to decide that? Even if he's concerned as a friend, the act of sharing someone else's private information without their consent is a breach of trust. Unless there's a legal obligation to report something (like abuse or illegal activity), it's generally considered a violation of privacy.\n\nAlso, the information he shared was about the girl's sexual activity. Unless the mother is directly involved in the girl's life and there's a legitimate concern about her well-being (like underage sex being illegal), the friend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary. The girl is 15, same as the user, so if she's having sex at 15, depending on the jurisdiction, that might be a legal issue. But the user didn't mention that aspect. He just felt that the mother should know, even though the girl shared it with him in confidence.\n\nAnother angle: the user might have felt that the mother had a right to know, but the friend didn't give her permission to share. Even if the user's intention was to protect the girl or to inform her parent, the method of doing so without consent is problematic. The result was the friend being upset and the friendship ending, which is a consequence of breaking that trust.\n\nSo, the main issues here are confidentiality, trust, and the right to privacy. Unless there was a clear and present danger, the user overstepped by sharing the information. Therefore, the user is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
