At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who confided in their friend about sleeping around and some personal details. The friend (the author) then told the girl's mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and they're no longer talking.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. When someone shares personal information, especially about their sexual activity, there's an expectation of confidentiality. The author, even if they thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, breached that trust. \n\nBut wait, the mom is also a teacher. In some contexts, teachers have a responsibility to report certain things, like if a student is in danger or engaging in illegal activities. However, the girl is 15, and while having sex at 13 might be a concern (if it's under the age of consent in their area), the author isn't a teacher or an authority figure. The author's role here is just as a peer.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they thought the mother would want to know, but that doesn't necessarily justify sharing private information without consent. Even if the intention was to protect, the method was a breach of trust. The friend felt betrayed, which is a valid reaction. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's age. At 15, they might not fully grasp the implications of their actions, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The friend shared secrets under the assumption of trust, and the author's decision to inform the mother led to the friendship ending. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, the action of snitching without the friend's consent was wrong. The key factor is the violation of confidentiality in a personal relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
