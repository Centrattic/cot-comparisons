At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, same age as the author. The friend talked about her relationships and sleeping around, and the author decided to inform her mom, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared personal details with the author, possibly trusting them. The author then took that information to the mom, a teacher. The key points here are consent and the appropriateness of the action.\n\nIn most cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a breach of trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mom's perspective, they didn't check with the friend first. The friend's age is also a factor\u201415 is a minor, so parents are legally responsible for their children's well-being. However, the author's role here is as a peer, not a parent or authority figure. \n\nThe mom is also a teacher, which might add another layer. If the teacher is the parent, maybe there's a conflict of interest. The author's action might be seen as interfering in a parent-child relationship. But the author's intention was to inform the mother about their daughter's behavior, which could be seen as trying to protect the friend or the mother. However, the method was to share explicit details without the friend's consent, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nLegally, the mother might have a right to know, but ethically, the author might have overstepped by not addressing the issue with the friend first. The friend's autonomy and right to privacy are important here. The author's actions caused harm to the friendship, which is a significant consequence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they broke trust by snitching without a valid reason or consent. The right approach would have been to talk to the friend first or perhaps involve a trusted adult, but not the parent directly without the friend's knowledge.\n"
