At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their 15-year-old friend to her mom. The friend mentioned she sleeps around a lot and even told the author about losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the mom, leading to the friend cutting them off.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here. The author, a 15-year-old boy, got into a friendship where the girl shared personal details about her sexual activity. The author felt that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want to know, so they told the mom. Now the friend is upset and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider confidentiality and consent. Friendships often come with an unspoken understanding that personal information shared in confidence should stay between the friends. By telling the mother, the author broke that trust. Even if they had good intentions, like thinking the mother should know, did the friend give permission for that information to be shared with her parent? Probably not. \n\nAlso, the age factor. Both the author and the friend are 15, which is a minor. The mother is also a teacher, so there's a power dynamic here. The author might have felt that the teacher (as a parent and authority figure) needed to know, but minors often have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their friendships. Unless there was some explicit agreement to inform the parent, it's a breach of trust. \n\nThe friend reacted poorly, which makes sense. If someone shares personal stuff with you and then you tell their parent, especially in explicit detail, that's pretty harsh. The friend's actions, while maybe not ideal, don't necessarily mean the author should have acted as a middleman. The author's decision to snitch led to the friendship ending, which is a consequence of breaking trust. \n\nBut wait, could there be a justification? Like if the friend was in danger or if the author had a responsibility because the mother is a teacher? If the teacher is a mandatory reporter, but in this case, the author wasn't reporting abuse or something illegal, just the friend's sexual behavior. Unless the girl was under 13 in the relationship, but she mentioned losing her virginity at 13, which in some places isn't illegal, though close in age. However, the author's role here isn't as a teacher or authority figure, so they don't have that responsibility. \n\nSo the main issue is the violation of trust. Even if the author thought they were protecting the friend's mom, sharing explicit details without consent is a problem. The friend might be in the wrong in her actions, but the author's decision to inform her mom without her consent makes them the asshole. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
