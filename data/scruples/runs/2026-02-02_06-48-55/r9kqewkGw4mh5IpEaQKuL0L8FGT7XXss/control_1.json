At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's been talking about her sexual activities, and the author, a 15-year-old boy, told her mom, who's also his teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend shared personal details with the author, which he then passed on to her mother. The main issue is about confidentiality and the right to privacy. Even though the author was concerned about his friend's mother knowing, he didn't have the authority to act as a go-between. \n\nAt 15, both the author and his friend are minors. Sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. The fact that he did this to a parent, who's also a teacher, complicates things. The mother might have a responsibility as a parent, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's action of disclosing private details without the friend's permission.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior might be risky or inappropriate, but that doesn't mean others have the right to report her to a parent without her knowing. The author didn't consult a trusted adult authority figure directly but instead went to the mother through a personal conversation. The consequence is that the friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him anymore, which is a valid outcome of breaching trust.\n\nThere's a lack of context about why the author felt he needed to tell the mother. Was there a specific concern about safety or harm? If not, then it seems like an overreach. The author's reasoning was based on empathy for the mother, but that's not a valid substitute for respecting the friend's privacy unless there's an immediate risk.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone's actions are questionable, others have a responsibility to respect their privacy unless there's a legal obligation to report. Here, the author didn't explain any legal issues or imminent danger, just personal discomfort or concern. Therefore, the action of disclosing without consent is likely the wrong choice. The author should have perhaps talked to a school counselor or another authority figure if he had genuine concerns, rather than informing the mother directly.\n"
