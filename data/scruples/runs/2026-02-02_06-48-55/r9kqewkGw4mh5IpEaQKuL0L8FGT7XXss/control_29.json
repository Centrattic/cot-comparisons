At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 15-year-old guy who's asking if they were wrong to tell their friend's mom about the friend's sexual activities. The friend is also 15, and they shared personal details about relationships and losing virginity at 13. The author decided to share this with the mom, who is also their teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of both the author and the friend. At 15, they're both minors, and their parents or guardians do have a responsibility to know about their children's well-being. However, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is a big issue. Even if the author thought the mom should know, they didn't have the right to disclose such personal details.\n\nThe friend's behavior might be something the mom is concerned about, but the author's role here is to be a friend. Trust is a key component in friendships. If the friend confided in the author, expecting confidentiality, then sharing that information breaches the trust. The mom might not have known, but the author taking it upon themselves to inform the mom without considering the friend's wishes is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they tried to see it from the mom's perspective, but that doesn't justify violating the friend's privacy. The friend's autonomy and right to privacy should be respected. Even if the actions are something the mom might disapprove of, the author didn't have the authority to act as a judge or to report the friend. The friend's mom is a teacher and parent, so she might have a duty of care, but the author shouldn't be the one to report their friend's personal life unless there's a legal obligation, which in this case there isn't mentioned.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction is a clear sign that the author overstepped. Now the friendship is broken, which is a consequence of the author's actions. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing for the friend's own good, but it's not their place to decide that. The mom would need to address the situation directly with her daughter if she's concerned.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely violated the friend's privacy and trust. Even with good intentions, sharing sensitive information without consent is generally wrong. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
