At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year-old guy who befriended another girl in his class. They talked a lot and she mentioned in detail that she sleeps around a lot, including losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to tell her mom (who is also his teacher) all these details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl shared personal information with the author, which is a form of trust. By snitching, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought it was for the right reasons, like wanting to protect the girl from her mom or because he empathized with the mom's perspective, the action of disclosing private information without consent is a breach of confidentiality. \n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning was that he wanted to let the mom know in case she didn't already. However, the mom is also a teacher, so maybe there's a duty of care here. But the author isn't a teacher; he's a peer. So, even if there's a concern about the girl's well-being, it's not up to the friend to report her. The mom should have been approached through appropriate channels if there was a serious concern about the girl's safety or if there were laws being broken. However, having multiple relationships or losing virginity at 13, while potentially underage (if 13 is below the legal age of consent in their area), might be a different matter. But the author isn't reporting abuse or illegal activity; he's reporting personal behavior.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the right to privacy. Friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a danger involved. Since the author didn't mention any illegal activity or harm, it seems like he violated his friend's trust for his own judgment of what's right. Additionally, the friend might feel betrayed, which is why she's cutting off contact. The author's action could have serious consequences for the friend, like strained family relationships or potential disciplinary actions from the mom. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's motivation. He thought from the mom's perspective and decided he would want to know if he were in her position. But that's personal opinion, not a legal or ethical obligation. Without knowing if the mom was already aware or if there were other factors, the author took it upon himself to act as a go-between, which isn't his role.\n\nIn many cases, when someone shares personal information, it's implied that it's confidential. The author didn't ask for permission to share it with the mom, so that's a breach. Unless the situation was an emergency or required intervention (like abuse), the author overstepped. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he violated the trust of his friend by sharing her private information without consent, even if he had good intentions. The correct answer would be A.\n"
