At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. So the situation is that the author's friend told them in detail about sleeping around, and the author then told the friend's mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend shared personal information with the author. The author decided to share that information with the mother, thinking about the mother's perspective. But the friend didn't ask the author to keep it a secret, but also, sharing such details with a parent without consent is a big deal.\n\nConfidentiality is important in friendships. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, telling a parent without the friend's consent breaches that trust. The friend was 15, so maybe there's a legal aspect too. In some places, if a minor is engaging in certain sexual activities, parents might need to be informed. But the author isn't the parent, so they might not have the authority to decide that. Also, the friend lost her virginity at 13, which in some places could be a legal concern depending on local laws, but the author's role here is more about trust and friendship.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they wanted to protect the friend by informing the mother, but that's not the friend's choice. The friend might have wanted privacy, and the author didn't consider that. The friend's autonomy is a big factor here. Even if the author had good intentions, the action of betraying the friend's confidence without a clear legal mandate or consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable\u2014losing trust in a friend over such a personal matter would be hurtful. The author might not be the \"asshole\" in the sense of being evil, but they definitely made a mistake in breaking trust. So the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
