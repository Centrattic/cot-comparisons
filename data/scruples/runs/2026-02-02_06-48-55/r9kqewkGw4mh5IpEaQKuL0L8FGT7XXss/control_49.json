At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking about sleeping around, and the author told the girl's mom, who is also their teacher. The friend is now upset and refuses to talk to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author shares information given in confidence by a friend with her mother. The mother is a teacher, which might complicate things because teachers have a duty of care. But the friend is a minor, so there might be legal considerations. The author did this out of concern for the friend's well-being, thinking the mother should know. However, the friend was 15, and the author is also 15, so they might not fully understand the implications of their actions.\n\nConfidentiality is a big issue here. The friend shared personal details with the author, expecting privacy. By telling the mother, the author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone's private information without consent can be seen as a violation of trust. The friend's reaction is expected because she feels betrayed. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of parental rights. Parents do have a right to know about their child's activities, especially when it comes to safety. However, the author isn't the parent; they're just another student. The mother is a teacher, so maybe she already has a role in supervising the students. But the author's role here is more as a friend. The author might have thought they were protecting the friend by informing the mother, but it's possible that the mother should be informed through proper channels, like a teacher or counselor, rather than another student.\n\nAnother angle is the age. Both the author and the friend are 15. At that age, judgment can be immature, and the concept of boundaries and privacy might not be fully developed. The author might not realize that even with good intentions, their actions have lasting consequences. The friend losing her virginity at 13 is a sensitive issue, and sharing that could have legal or ethical implications depending on the jurisdiction. But since the mother is a teacher, maybe there's a responsibility to report certain things, but again, that's more the teacher's duty.\n\nThe outcome is that the friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend shared this information in confidence, the author's duty was to keep it private unless there was a risk of harm. Since the author decided to inform the mother, even without concrete evidence of harm, it's a breach of trust. So from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong for violating the friend's trust, even if the intention was to help.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a justification. If the author believed that the friend was engaging in risky behavior that could harm her, then maybe they thought the mother needed to know. However, the author's role isn't to act as a parental figure. The appropriate action might have been to talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher or counselor, rather than the friend's mother. But since the mother is a teacher, maybe the author thought that was the right approach. However, the author's decision to act without considering the friend's autonomy and privacy is problematic.\n\nIn summary, the key points are breach of trust, the appropriateness of sharing private information, and the role of a minor in such decisions. The author's actions likely hurt the friendship and violated the friend's privacy, so they are probably in the wrong.\n"
