At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves the friend sharing explicit details about sleeping around, and the author deciding to tell her mom. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 15, same age as the friend. The friend shared personal information, which the author then disclosed to the mother. Even though the author might have thought they were doing the right thing, there's an issue of confidentiality here. Friends typically expect that what they share is private. The author didn't go to the friend's mom directly to express concern but instead snitched without the friend's consent. \n\nAlso, the friend was 15, so there might be concerns about her behavior, but the author's approach was to inform the mother without any prior discussion. The mother ended up believing the author, leading to the friend cutting off the author. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the main issue is the breach of trust. The author didn't seek the friend's permission to share the information, didn't discuss it with the friend first, and didn't consider other options like talking to the friend about their behavior instead of immediately going to the mother. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method was inappropriate. \n\nThe friend's actions might be concerning, but the author's responsibility isn't to act as a parent or authority figure. There's also the aspect of the mother being a teacher, which might complicate things further. The author's decision to involve the mother without the friend's consent likely caused more harm than good. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong for breaking trust and handling the situation in a way that damaged the friendship. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
