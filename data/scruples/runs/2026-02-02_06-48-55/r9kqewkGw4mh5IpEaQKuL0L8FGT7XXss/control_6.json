At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on his friend by telling her mom about her sexual activities. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who shared explicit details about her sexual experiences with the author, who is also a 15-year-old male student. The author decided to inform the girl's mother, who is also his teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially with a peer, there's an unspoken agreement that it will be kept private. The author broke that trust by revealing her secrets to her mother. Even though the author might have had good intentions, like protecting her from potential risks or considering her mother's perspective, the method of handling it was direct and without the friend's consent. \n\nNext, legal and ethical aspects. In many places, there's no legal obligation to report a peer's private behavior unless there's a risk of harm. The author isn't a parent or guardian, so he doesn't have the authority to make decisions on her behalf. The mother could have her own reasons for not knowing, and the author's intervention might have violated the girl's autonomy.\n\nThe consequence is the loss of the friendship. The friend reacted negatively because her trust was broken. The author's action, while perhaps well-meaning, crossed a boundary. The fact that the mother started believing the author might have led to conflict within the family, which the author may not have foreseen.\n\nAdditionally, the age factor is important. Both are minors, and the girl lost her virginity at 13, which is below the age of consent in many places. However, the author's role here is about sharing information, not the legality of the girl's actions. The key issue is the breach of trust and confidentiality without a clear justification beyond the author's personal ethics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely acted in the wrong by violating the friend's privacy and trust without a valid reason. The decision to inform the mother wasn't something the author was entitled to make, leading to the breakdown of the friendship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
