At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15. The friend mentioned sleeping around and losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to tell her mom, who's a teacher, in explicit detail.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a teenager, same age as the friend, and they were sharing personal information. The friend was open about her relationships and sexual experiences. The author heard this and felt it was necessary to inform the mother, even though the mother is also a teacher. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author had a personal conversation with their friend, who shared intimate details. The author then decided to share those details with the mother. The friend is now upset and refuses to talk to the author. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The mother is a teacher, so the author might think they have a responsibility to report. However, the friend shared this information in a private setting. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the mother is a teacher. \n\nI should think about the concept of confidentiality in friendships. If someone tells you something personal, you're expected to keep it private unless there's a safety concern. The author's reasoning is that they considered the mother's perspective and wanted to tell her. But the friend is a minor, and the mother, as a parent and teacher, might have a duty to know. However, the author's role is as a peer, not a guardian. \n\nThe possible harm here is the damage to the friendship and the friend's privacy being violated. The mother might need that information for the child's well-being, but the author's method of disclosure could have been inappropriate. Instead of sharing explicit details, maybe the mother should have been approached in a more general way, but the author didn't do that. They told the mother everything the friend said. \n\nAlso, the friend is 15, so she's a minor. The author is her age, so they might not be in a position to act as a parent. The mother's duty as a parent is to know about her child's well-being, but the child shared this with a peer. The author's action could be seen as taking the role of a parent without being one. \n\nAnother aspect is the potential consequences. The friend is now cut off from the author, and the mother is involved. But was the author's action justified? If the friend was engaging in risky behavior, maybe the author had a duty to inform the mother. However, the friend's actions, while perhaps concerning, were shared voluntarily. The author might have overstepped by not keeping the confidence, even if their intention was to help.\n\nIn many cases, even if a minor shares personal information, the expectation is that their peers won't disclose it to adults without a valid reason. The author might have a good intention, but the method was wrong. Also, the fact that the mother is a teacher might mean that the author thought they had to report, but the teacher might handle it as a parent as well. The line between concern and betrayal is thin here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they broke a personal trust between friends, even if the mother is a teacher. Unless there was a clear danger to the friend, which isn't mentioned here, the author's action is likely a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
