At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the author, a 15-year-old, told the friend's mother (who is also their teacher) about the friend's sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The friend now refuses to talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author was a friend who was told these details in confidence. By sharing that information with the mother, they breached the friend's privacy. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, the act of disclosing personal information without consent is a big issue. \n\nAt 15, the author might not fully understand the implications of such actions, but that doesn't excuse the breach of trust. Friends are supposed to keep each other's confidences unless there's a serious risk involved. However, in this case, the author didn't mention any immediate harm or danger, just personal choices. The mother's reaction and the friend's anger suggest that the disclosure caused harm to their relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mother is a teacher adds another layer. Maybe the author believed the teacher had a responsibility to know, but unless there's a legal or safety concern (like underage sex involving minors, which could be a legal issue depending on the jurisdiction), it's still a privacy breach. Even if the mother is a teacher, the student's private information shouldn't be shared without consent unless it's a mandatory reporting situation. However, the daughter is 15, so if she's having sex with someone of legal age, it might not be reportable, but that's a separate legal question. \n\nThe main issue here is the violation of trust. The author was entrusted with private information and shared it, leading to the friend cutting them off. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the friend or inform the mother, the method was inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to discuss concerns with the friend directly or, if necessary, involve a trusted adult without revealing specific details. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they broke their friend's trust by sharing private information without permission, regardless of their intentions.\n"
