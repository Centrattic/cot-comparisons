At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The friend is 15, same as the author. The friend mentioned to the author that she sleeps around a lot, and the author told her mom, who's also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 15, so a minor, and their friend is also 15. The friend was sharing personal details about her relationships and sexual activity. The author felt that if they were in the mom's position, they'd want to know, so they told the mom. The result was the friend cutting ties.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. From an ethical standpoint, sharing someone's private information without their consent is usually a breach of trust, even if the intent is to protect them. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the parent, but in doing so, they violated their friend's privacy.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. Since the mother is also a teacher, maybe the author thought the teacher had a duty to know, especially if the student was engaging in risky behavior. However, the friend was 15, so depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about minors and such disclosures. If the teacher is a mandated reporter, they might have to act if there's abuse or illegal activity, but consensual sexual activity between minors might not be a legal issue. The author's role is a peer, not an authority figure, so they might not have the right to disclose that information.\n\nAnother angle: the friend shared the information in confidence. By telling the mom, the author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was wrong. The friend was probably upset because the personal details were shared without permission. The author's action likely damaged the friendship irreparably, which is a significant consequence.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was concerned for their friend's well-being, thinking that the mom should know. However, the appropriate way would be for the author to talk to the friend about the risks or maybe inform the teacher with the friend's consent, or let the teacher handle it if it's a school-related issue. Snitching without the friend's knowledge might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the individuals, they're still teenagers learning about relationships and privacy. The author might not fully grasp the implications of their actions. But the act of betraying a friend's trust is a clear boundary violation. So even if the intent was good, the action was wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, which is a violation of trust, regardless of the intent. The correct answer would be A.\n"
