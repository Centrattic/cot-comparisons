At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves the friend talking about her sexual activities, and the author deciding to inform her mother, who's also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend, a 15-year-old girl, was sharing personal details about her sexual experiences. The author, also 15, felt that the mother should know, leading to the friend cutting off contact. \n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. When someone shares personal information, they usually expect it to stay between them and the person they're talking to. The author didn't ask if the friend wanted her mother to know, so that's a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was based on empathy for the mother. But is it the author's place to decide what's best for the friend and her family? Even with good intentions, sharing such sensitive info without consent can be harmful. It's possible the friend felt betrayed, leading to the loss of the friendship. \n\nLegal aspects might come into play too. Depending on the jurisdiction, there could be laws about reporting minors' activities, but the friend isn't a minor in this case (both are 15). However, the mother's role as a teacher might have a duty to report certain things, but the author isn't a professional in that capacity. \n\nThe outcome shows the friend is hurt and angry, which indicates the action was wrong in her eyes. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method was invasive and caused damage. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by sharing private details without consent, leading to a broken trust. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
