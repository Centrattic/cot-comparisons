At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a 15-year-old boy who befriended another girl in his class. They have a lot in common and start talking a lot. Over time, his friend starts sharing explicit details about her sexual activities, like sleeping around, breaking up with a FWB (friends with benefits), and trying to get with her BFF (best friend who's a guy). The user, after initially not caring, starts to think about how her mother would feel. He then tells her mom, a teacher, all the details, including the 13-year-old virginity loss. The mom initially didn't believe but later did, and now the friend is upset and won't talk to him. The question is whether the user was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider confidentiality. The friend shared personal information with the user, expecting it to stay private. The user then shared it with the mother without consent. That's a breach of trust. Even if the user thought he was doing the right thing, sharing someone's private details without their permission is a big issue.\n\nNext, the user's motivation. He mentions seeing things from the mother's perspective and wanting to inform her. But is it his place to decide? The friend is 15, so a minor. Depending on the legal context, there might be a duty to report certain things, but sharing explicit details isn't necessarily one of those cases. The mother is a teacher, so there might be some school policies about reporting, but again, just sharing personal information isn't the same as reporting abuse or neglect.\n\nImpact on the friendship. The friend is now upset and has cut off contact. The user's action led directly to that. Even if he thought he was helping, the result is a broken friendship. The user might have overstepped by sharing personal details without the friend's consent.\n\nLegal aspects? In many places, minors can't be forced to report each other's behavior unless it's abuse or something severe. Sleeping around isn't illegal, so there's no legal obligation to report it. The user acted on his own judgment, which might not be appropriate.\n\nEthically, sharing someone's private info without their permission is a violation of trust. Even if the user had good intentions, the act itself is problematic. The mother is a teacher, which gives her a role in the student's life, but that doesn't mean she has the right to know everything the student shares with others.\n\nPossible defenses: The user thought he was protecting the friend by informing the mother. But that's a stretch. The mother's role is to care for her daughter, but the daughter shared with a peer, not the parent. The user's role isn't to police the friend's behavior or act as a parental figure.\n\nIn conclusion, the user shared confidential information without consent, which is a breach of trust. The action caused harm to the friendship and may not have been necessary. Even if he thought he was helping, the wrong is in the act itself. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
