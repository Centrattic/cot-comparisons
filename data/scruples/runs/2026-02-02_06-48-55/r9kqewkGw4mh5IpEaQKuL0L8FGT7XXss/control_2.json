At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author about her sexual activities and sleeping around. The author then told the girl's mom, who is also a teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is 15, same age as the friend. They became friends and the friend shared personal details. The author decided to inform the mother, thinking from the mother's perspective. The main issue is whether sharing someone's private information without consent is justified.\n\nIn general, respecting privacy is important. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by informing a parent, the friend might have trusted them with that information. The author didn't check with the friend if she wanted to share it with her mom. The mother is also a teacher, so maybe there's a duty of care, but the friend is a minor, so teachers might have responsibilities regarding student well-being. However, the author isn't the teacher; they're a peer. \n\nThe age here is 15, so both are minors. The mother is concerned about her daughter's activities, and the daughter is upset because her friend betrayed her trust. The author might have acted out of concern but crossed a line by disclosing personal information without consent. Even if the intention was good, the action of snitching without the friend's permission likely breached trust, leading to the friendship ending. \n\nLegally, in some places, if a minor is engaging in sexual activity, it might be reportable if there's something illegal, but the scenario here doesn't mention anything illegal, just that she sleeps around. The author's motivation was based on empathy for the mother, but that doesn't necessarily validate sharing the information without consent. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because they violated the friend's trust by sharing private details without her knowledge. Even if the intention was to protect, the method was unethical. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
