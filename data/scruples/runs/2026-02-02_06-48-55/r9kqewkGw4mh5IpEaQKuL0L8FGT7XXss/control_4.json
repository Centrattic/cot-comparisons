At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who told their friend's mom about her sleeping around is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for snitching. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend (a 15-year-old girl) told the author (a 15-year-old boy who is also a student) explicit details about her sexual activity and relationships. The author then went to the girl's mom, who's also a teacher, and told her all the details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The friend shared private information with the author. The author, thinking from the mother's perspective, decided to inform her. But does the author have the right to do that? \n\nConfidentiality is a big issue here. When someone shares personal information, even if it's something the listener disagrees with, there's an expectation of privacy. Unless there's a legal obligation to report something (like abuse), sharing that info without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the author is a minor, so maybe there's a difference in how responsibility is viewed here compared to an adult. But the action itself\u2014snitching on a friend's personal life to a parent\u2014could harm the friendship and the friend's reputation. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that he wanted to protect the friend by informing the mother, but does that justify breaking trust? Maybe not, especially if the mother wasn't the one who asked for the information. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with the friend first or seeking advice from an adult, like a counselor or a parent, instead of taking matters into his own hands.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's actions (sleeping around at 15) might be a concern for the mother, but the author's role in disclosing that is questionable. The friend might be engaging in behaviors that are her choice, even if others don't approve. The author's decision to report her without her consent could be seen as violating their friendship and invading her privacy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. The action of reporting the friend's private matters without her consent breaches trust and could have serious consequences. The right approach might have been to talk to the friend about concerns or inform a trusted adult about the friend's behavior without revealing confidential information. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
