At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old boy, has a friend who's a 15-year-old girl. They met in class and became friends because they share a lot of interests. The girl started telling the author in detail about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The author felt it was wrong and thought about how the girl's mom would feel if she knew. So, the author told the mom, who is also his teacher, all the explicit details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of confidentiality in friendships. Friends typically expect some level of trust, and sharing personal information without permission can breach that trust. The girl might not have intended for the author to take the information further, so by telling her mom, the author violated that trust. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing for the mom's sake, the friend's privacy was compromised. \n\nAlso, the age of the individuals is relevant here. At 15, they're minors, and there might be legal implications if the mom wasn't aware of her daughter's activities. But in terms of social ethics, the author didn't directly report to authorities but to the mom/teacher. However, the mom's role as a teacher might mean she has a responsibility to report certain things, but the author's decision to share the information without the friend's consent is key here.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intention. He thought from the mother's perspective and considered what a parent would want to know. But even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. The friend's reaction is a consequence of that action, showing the impact of the breach.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the mom initially thought the daughter was making it up but later believed the author suggests that the information was sensitive and possibly overheard or taken out of context. The author might not have considered if the girl was lying or if the mom was appropriately handling the situation. However, the main issue remains the unauthorized disclosure of personal matters.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy is a key principle. Unless there's an immediate risk of harm, which isn't mentioned here, sharing personal information without consent is generally considered wrong. The author didn't have the right to act as a go-between for the mother and the friend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions likely breached the trust between friends and invaded the girl's privacy. Even if the author thought it was for the mother's benefit, it's the friend's right to decide who knows about her personal life. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
