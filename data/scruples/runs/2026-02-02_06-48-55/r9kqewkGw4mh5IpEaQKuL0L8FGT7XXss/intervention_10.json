At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who shared explicit details about her sexual activities with her friend, who then told the girl's mother, who is also a teacher. The friend is now upset and has stopped talking to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend shared personal and sensitive information with the author. Even if the author didn't care initially, they later decided to inform the mother. The author's reasoning was that they would want to know if they were the mother, but that doesn't necessarily justify sharing private details without consent.\n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. When someone shares personal information, especially about their private life, they usually expect it to stay between them. The author broke that trust. Even if the author's intent was to protect the friend or her mother, sharing explicit details about her sexual activities, including losing virginity at 13, is a significant breach of privacy. \n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, which might mean the author felt there was a duty to report. But unless there's a legal obligation or a threat of harm to the friend or others, the author isn't bound to inform the parent. The friend's actions, while perhaps concerning, don't necessarily constitute harm that requires an adult to intervene. \n\nThe result is that the friend is now estranged, which suggests the action had negative consequences. The author might have overstepped by not discussing their concerns with the friend first or seeking advice from a trusted adult instead of directly informing the mother. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that they were trying to do the right thing by considering the mother's viewpoint. But intentions don't always excuse the outcome. The method of handling the situation was flawed because it involved sharing private information without consent. \n\nConsidering these points, the author broke the trust of their friend, acted without considering the friend's autonomy, and caused a rift in their relationship. Even if the author's intentions were good, the action of snitching without a valid reason (like imminent harm) makes them the asshole.\n"
