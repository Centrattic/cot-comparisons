At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is, the author is a 15-year-old guy who became friends with a girl (also 15) in class. They had a lot in common and talked about various things. At some point, the girl shared explicit details about her sexual activity, including losing her virginity at 13 and being involved with multiple partners. The author, after considering the mother's perspective, decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also one of his teachers. The mom initially thought the daughter was making it up but later believed him. The friend is now upset and not talking to the author anymore.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality, age of the individuals, and the author's role as a peer. First, both are minors, 15 years old. The girl is sharing personal information with a peer, which is common among friends. The author decided to disclose this to the mother, who is a teacher. The author's reasoning was that he thought the mother should know, putting himself in her position. But the friend is now upset, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, there's no legal obligation for a 15-year-old to report another minor's behavior unless there's a risk of harm. The author isn't a parent or legal guardian, so he's not responsible for the girl's actions. However, the girl shared this information voluntarily, expecting confidentiality. By breaking that trust, the author violated the friend's privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, the disclosure wasn't necessary unless there was an actual risk that required reporting. Since the girl is 15 and engaging in sexual activity, while that might be concerning, it's not an emergency unless there's abuse or coercion involved. The author didn't mention any such issues, just that she sleeps around. The mother's reaction shows that the information was shocking, but the author didn't have the authority to decide that the mother needed to know. The friendship was based on mutual trust, and the author's action breached that trust. So, from an ethical standpoint, the author is in the wrong for betraying the friend's confidence without a compelling reason.\n"
