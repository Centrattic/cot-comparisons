At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the friend was talking about sleeping around, and the author told her mom. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author is 15, same age as the friend. They became friends because they had common interests. The friend was sharing personal details about her relationships and sexual activities. The author then decided to inform her mother, who's also a teacher, about these details. The friend's mom initially didn't believe the daughter was making things up but later did. The friend is now angry and the friendship is broken.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had the right to share the friend's private information with her mother. Privacy is a big deal, especially when it comes to personal and intimate matters. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing from their perspective, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. \n\nNow, considering the ages involved, both are minors. In many places, the legal age for consent and other matters is 18, so a 15-year-old engaging in sexual activity might be under the age of consent. However, the author is also 15, so they might not be in a position to judge or report that. But the author's action here was to inform the mother, not necessarily to report to authorities. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that they put themselves in the mother's shoes and thought the mother would want to know. But is that enough justification? Friends often share personal stories, and unless there's a clear risk of harm, others aren't obligated to report that information. The author might have a good intention, thinking they're protecting the friend or the friend's family, but the method of using the information they were entrusted with could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the teacher (the mother). If the mother is both a parent and a teacher, there might be a conflict of interest. But the author didn't approach the mother as a teacher; they did it as a parent. That could complicate things, especially if the teacher is now involved in disciplinary actions related to her child's personal life.\n\nAlso, the friend was open about her activities, but that doesn't mean she wanted that information shared. The author's action caused the friendship to end, which is a significant consequence. The author might have thought they were acting in the friend's best interest, but without the friend's consent, it's a breach of confidentiality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle of autonomy and privacy. People have the right to control their personal information. Unless there's a legal obligation to report (like child abuse or a crime), sharing personal details without consent is a violation. Since the friend was sharing willingly, the author is still responsible for keeping that information private unless there's immediate danger.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't have the right to share the friend's private information with her mother without permission. Even with good intentions, the action breached trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
