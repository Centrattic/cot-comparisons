At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking to the author about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the girl's mom, who's also a teacher, leading to the friend cutting ties.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and privacy. The author overheard or was told confidential information by their friend. Even if the author thought they were looking out for the friend's best interest by involving the mother, sharing someone's personal details without their permission is a breach of trust. The friend might have shared those things under the assumption that it was a private conversation. \n\nAlso, the age of consent and the mother's role as a teacher might complicate things. But the key issue is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Even if the author felt it was necessary, the friend might not have wanted that information shared. The result was the friend stopping communication, which is a natural consequence of a broken trust. \n\nThe author's reasoning was trying to see it from the mother's perspective, but that doesn't negate the fact that the information was shared without the friend's consent. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they broke the friend's trust by disclosing personal matters without permission, regardless of their intentions.\n"
