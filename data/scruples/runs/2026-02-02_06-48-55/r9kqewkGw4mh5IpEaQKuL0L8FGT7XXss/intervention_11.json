At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend (15-year-old girl) shared explicit details about her sexual experiences with the author, who is also 15. The author decided to inform the friend's mom, who is their teacher, about these activities. The friend is now upset and doesn't speak to the author anymore.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, this is a bit tricky. In many places, children under 18 are considered minors, and sharing such personal information could involve confidentiality issues. However, if the friend was engaging in activities that might be illegal (like underage sex, which is possible if she's 15), there might be a duty to report, but the rules depend on the jurisdiction.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author isn't a legal guardian or an authority figure. They're just a peer. Even if the author thought they were protecting the friend's mother, sharing private information without consent can be a breach of trust. The friend shared her secrets with the author, expecting some level of privacy. By snitching, the author broke that trust, which is a big part of the issue here.\n\nAlso, the friend's mother might have a right to know if her daughter is in a dangerous situation. But the author's role here is complicated. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to a trusted adult first or giving the friend a chance to reconsider sharing such details. However, the main problem is that the author took it upon themselves to inform the mother without consulting anyone else.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friendship. The friend is now upset and cut off the author. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the method was flawed. There's also the aspect of the author possibly overstepping their bounds as a peer. They don't have the authority to act as a parent or teacher in this situation.\n\nIn terms of age, both are 15, which is a time when teens are learning about boundaries and privacy. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, violated the friend's privacy without her consent. Even if the intent was to help, the execution damaged their relationship and trust.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author likely did something wrong by sharing private information without the friend's consent, leading to broken trust and a ruined friendship. The right thing would have been to respect the friend's privacy or, if concerned, to talk to a responsible adult rather than the parent directly.\n"
