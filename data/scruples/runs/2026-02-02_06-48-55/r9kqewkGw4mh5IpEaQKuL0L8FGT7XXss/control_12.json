At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tattling on their friend to her mom. The friend was talking about sleeping around, and the author decided to tell her mom, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is 15, so they're a minor. The friend is also 15. The mom is also a teacher, which might add a layer of authority. The friend shared personal details about her sexual activity with the author. \n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the right to privacy. When someone shares personal information, especially about their sexual activities, there's an expectation of trust. The author didn't keep that secret and instead went to the mother. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, sharing such explicit details without consent can be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nAlso, the friend is a minor, so there's the question of whether the mother has a right to know. However, the friend shared this information in confidence with a peer, not in a situation where the author is obligated to report it. The author's action of revealing the details in a way that led to the mother believing the daughter was making things up initially, but then believing the author, might have caused significant harm to the friendship and the friend's reputation.\n\nThe author's motivation was concern for the friend's well-being, thinking from the mother's perspective. But in many cases, friends have the right to make their own choices, even if they're risky, as long as they're not harming others. The author's action disrupted that autonomy and caused a loss of trust.\n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's a duty to report (like abuse or danger), sharing someone's private information without consent is generally wrong. Since the author didn't have a legal obligation here, their action is more about personal judgment, which can be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe outcome was the friend cutting off contact, which shows the impact of the action. The author might feel justified, but the friend's reaction is a clear sign that the action was harmful. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
