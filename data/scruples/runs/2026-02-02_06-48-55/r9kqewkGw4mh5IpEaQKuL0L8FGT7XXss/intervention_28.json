At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend told the author about sleeping around a lot, and the author told the friend's mom, who is also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is 15, same age as the author. They became friends, and the friend shared personal details about her sex life. The author decided to tell the mom, thinking it's for her own good, considering the mom's perspective. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, trust, and the role of the author as a friend. Friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a serious issue. By sharing personal information about the friend's sexual activities with her mother, the author violated the trust between them. Even if the author thought it was right, the friend didn't ask for her mom to be involved. The author's action led to the friend cutting off the relationship, which is a big consequence.\n\nAlso, the author is 15, so maybe they don't fully understand the implications of their actions. But regardless of age, if someone shares something confidential, the expectation is that it stays between them unless there's a legal or safety concern. Since the friend didn't ask for her mom to be involved, the author overstepped by doing so without her consent.\n\nAnother angle: the mother is the friend's parent. The author might have thought they were protecting the friend, but the decision to share such personal details isn't the friend's parent's place unless there's a legal requirement. Even then, the parent's reaction was to believe the author, but the main issue is the breach of trust between the friends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author breached trust by sharing the friend's private information without her consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
