At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 15-year-old boy told his friend's mom that the friend sleeps around and had lost her virginity at 13. The friend is also 15, and she shared these details with the author. The author decided to inform the mom because he thought it was important from a parental perspective. Now, the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information with you, there's an expectation that it will stay between you. The author didn't get permission to share this info. Even if the mom is also a teacher, that doesn't necessarily mean the author has the right to disclose private conversations without consent. \n\nNext, the age factor. Both are 15, which is a minor, and their parents are responsible for their welfare. However, as a friend, the author took on a role of authority by going to the mom. The friend might feel betrayed because she trusted the author with her personal life. \n\nThe author's reasoning was putting himself in the mother's shoes. But maybe the mother isn't the right person to approach here, especially if the daughter didn't want her to know. The author could have talked to a trusted adult or authority figure first, but directly informing the parent without considering the friend's privacy seems problematic.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the friend is now upset, and the relationship is ruined. The author might have acted out of concern, but the method was wrong. Even if the actions were intended to help, breaking trust without consent is usually seen as a breach of friendship. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a safety issue (like underage sex, which might be a legal concern), friends' private matters shouldn't be shared with parents. The author didn't consider if the friend wanted her mom to know. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
