At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old boy who confided in his friend about her sexual activities, then told her mom, who's also his teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal information with him. That's a key point. If someone shares something private, even if it's something you disagree with, you generally don't have the right to share it without their consent. Especially with parents. The friend might have trusted him enough to talk about her personal life, so breaking that trust could be a problem.\n\nThe user's reasoning was that he thought the mother should know. But the mother is also a teacher, so maybe there's a school policy about reporting such things. However, in many places, reporting a minor's sexual activity isn't mandatory unless there's abuse or something illegal. Since the friend is 15 and had sex at 13, maybe there's a legal aspect here. If the mother didn't know, and if the situation involved underage sex, the teacher might have a duty to report it. But the user isn't the teacher; he's a peer. \n\nHowever, the user's role as a peer is different. Even if he was concerned, he shouldn't have acted as a tattletale. The appropriate person to inform would be the teacher/parent, but even then, if the teacher is the parent, maybe the teacher should handle it. But the user went directly to the mother without considering the friend's privacy. That's where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, the friend now refuses to talk to him. The user's action hurt the trust between them. Even if he thought he did the right thing, sharing such personal information can have serious consequences. The friend's behavior might not be illegal, but the user's action of revealing it without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, even if the user had good intentions, he crossed a line by sharing private information. The friend had the right to privacy, and the user overstepped. The answer would be that he's in the wrong because he violated trust and privacy, even if he had concerns."
