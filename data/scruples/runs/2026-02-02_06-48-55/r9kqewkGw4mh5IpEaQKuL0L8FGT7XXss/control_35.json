At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal information with the author. That's a key point. When someone tells you something private, there's an implied trust that you won't share it without their consent. Even if the author thought it was for a good reason, like the mother's concern, it's a breach of trust.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning. They mention trying to see it from the mother's perspective and deciding they'd want to know. But the mother is already the parent, so maybe it's not the author's place to decide what the parent should know. Plus, the author is a peer, not a parent. The friend's actions, while perhaps concerning, are her own choices. Unless there was a legal issue or harm, like underage drinking or something illegal, the author might not have the right to intervene that way.\n\nAlso, the consequence is that the friend no longer talks to the author. That shows the impact of the action. The author might have thought they were helping, but it damaged their friendship. The mother's reaction also changed from disbelief to belief, which could have serious consequences for the friend, like being grounded or worse, based on how strict the mother is.\n\nLegally, in many places, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a violation of privacy, especially if it's about sexual activity. Even if the author is a minor, the act of disclosure can still be seen as a breach. The mother might have the right to know as a parent, but the author isn't in a position to decide that. The friend's privacy rights should be respected unless there's a clear risk of harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably violated the friend's trust, overstepped their role as a peer, and caused unnecessary harm. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
