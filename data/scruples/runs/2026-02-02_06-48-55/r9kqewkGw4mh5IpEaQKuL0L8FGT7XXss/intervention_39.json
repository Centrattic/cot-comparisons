At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling her mom about her explicit details regarding sleeping around.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a 15-year-old who became friends with another girl in class. They bonded over shared interests, and the friend started talking about her relationships and casual sex. The author kept quiet for a month, then decided to tell the mother (who is also a teacher) about the daughter's activities, leading to the friend cutting off the author.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to share this information. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Confidentiality and Trust**: When someone shares personal information, especially about themselves, there's an implicit trust that it won't be spread. The author might have broken that trust by sharing details with the mother. Even if the friend wasn't in an official relationship (FWB, BFF guy), the author's disclosure could be seen as violating confidentiality.\n\n2. **Intentions**: The author mentions they did this thinking from the mother's perspective. They felt the mother would want to know. But whose responsibility is it to inform a parent about a friend's behavior? Friends typically don't act as informants unless there's an obligation (like a teacher-student situation where safety is a concern). Here, the author isn't a parent or authority figure; they're a peer.\n\n3. **Consequences**: The friend is now upset and refuses to talk to the author. The mother might have overreacted or taken it seriously. The author's action led to a broken friendship. This outcome suggests that the action had negative repercussions, which is a red flag for the wrongness of the action.\n\n4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: In many places, there's a legal concept of confidentiality in communications, especially in certain roles like therapists or teachers. But since the author is a peer friend, there's no legal obligation. Ethically, it's more about respect and consent. The friend didn't give permission for her private matters to be discussed with her parent.\n\n5. **Age Factor**: Both are 15, which is a minor. Peer relationships at this age can be volatile, and the line between concern and overstepping is thin. The author's decision to inform the mother might be seen as taking a parental role, which isn't appropriate between friends.\n\n6. **Proportionality**: The friend's behavior (sleeping around) isn't illegal or harmful to others unless there's exploitation or non-consensual acts. The author's action might be an overreaction if the friend's actions weren't endangering others. Unless there's a risk of harm, it's more a personal choice the friend makes, not the author's place to report.\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions**: Instead of informing the mother, perhaps the author could have addressed the issue differently, like discussing it directly with the friend, setting boundaries about what's shared, or seeking advice from a trusted adult (teacher, school counselor) about how to handle the situation without breaching trust.\n\nWeighing these factors, the author likely overstepped by disclosing personal information without consent. The action was a breach of trust, leading to a broken friendship. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
