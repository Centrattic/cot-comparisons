At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for telling his friend's mother about her sexual activities.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal details with the author. The author considered this from the mother's perspective and decided to inform her. The key points here are confidentiality and consent. The friend trusted the author with private information, and by sharing it with the mother without permission, the author breached that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like worrying about the friend's well-being or the mother's right to know, the act of snitching without permission is a violation of trust. \n\nAlso, the friend was 15, so there might be legal implications depending on the jurisdiction regarding minors discussing such matters with adults. However, the main ethical issue is the betrayal of confidentiality. The author's action led to the friend cutting off contact, which is a significant consequence. \n\nSo, even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the method was wrong. The correct approach would have been to talk to the friend first, express concerns, or perhaps inform a trusted adult but not the mother directly without consent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
