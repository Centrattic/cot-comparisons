At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told his friend's mom about her sexual activities is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the friend shared private information with him. He didn't confront her or talk to her mom at first, but after some time, he decided to go to the mom. The key here is the intent. Why did he decide to snitch? He thought from the mother's perspective and felt she should know. But did he have the right to disclose that info?\n\nConfidentiality is important, especially in friendships. If someone shares something personal, the listener is expected to keep it private unless there's a legal obligation or immediate harm. Here, there's no mention of harm to the girl or others, just her lifestyle choices. \n\nHe told the mother explicit details, including losing virginity at 13. Even if the mother is a teacher, sharing that level of detail without consent could breach privacy. The friend was a minor, so maybe there are legal aspects, but in many places, minors can have privacy rights as well. \n\nAlso, the aftermath is that the friend is upset and won't talk to him. He might have crossed a line by not respecting her confidentiality. Unless there was a legal duty to report something illegal (like underage sex, but if both are minors in a legal age range, maybe not). \n\nSo, the main points: breach of trust, lack of consent to share info, not a legal obligation, and the friendship was ruined. The answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong because he violated her privacy without good cause.\n"
