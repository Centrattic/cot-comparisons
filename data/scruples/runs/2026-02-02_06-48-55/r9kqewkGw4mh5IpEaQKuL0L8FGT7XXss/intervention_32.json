At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who told their friend's mom about her sleeping around is in the wrong. The friend is 15, and the person who told is also 15. The friend shared these details with them, and they decided to tell the mom, who's a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially about their private life, they usually expect it to stay between them and the person they're telling. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the mom, but that doesn't necessarily make it okay. The friend might have shared these things in confidence, and the author broke that trust.\n\nThen there's the age factor. Both are minors, and the friend lost her virginity at 13. Depending on the legal age of consent in their area, this could be a sensitive issue. However, the author's action here is more about confidentiality than legality. Even if the mom has a right to know, the way the information was shared matters. The author didn't check with the friend or consult someone else before snitching. \n\nThe motive is important too. The author thought from the mom's perspective and wanted to inform her. But maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to the mom first about their concerns without revealing so much personal detail. By telling the mom in explicit detail, they might have overstepped and caused unnecessary harm to their friendship.\n\nAlso, the result is that the friend is now upset and won't talk to them. Breaking someone's trust like that can have lasting effects, even if the intent was to protect the friend. The author needs to consider that their actions, while possibly well-meaning, violated the friend's privacy and trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they broke a confidence without a good reason and without considering the consequences on the friendship. The friend's privacy matters, and the author should have handled the situation differently, maybe by talking to a trusted adult first or addressing the issue with the friend directly.\n"
