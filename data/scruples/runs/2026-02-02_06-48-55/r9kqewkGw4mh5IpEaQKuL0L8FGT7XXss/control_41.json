At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old guy who befriended another girl in his class. They bonded over shared interests, and the friend started talking about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The user decided to tell the girl's mom, who's also his teacher, all the details. Now the friend is upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: he thought about how he'd want to know if he were in the mom's position. But is that a valid justification? The user didn't have the friend's consent to share her personal information. Even if he's concerned about her well-being, the method he used was to inform her parent directly without any prior communication or checking in on her.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and intent. Friends usually share personal stuff expecting it to stay private. By snitching, the user broke that trust. Even if his intent was to protect, the action was a breach of privacy. The mom might have a right to know if there's something harmful, but the user isn't in a position to make that judgment. Also, the girl might be old enough for her actions, but sharing that info without consent is still a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the user is 15, same age as the friend. They might not have the maturity to handle such situations. The mom is a teacher, but using her as a go-between without the friend's knowledge raises questions about the user's approach. The result is damaging the friendship, which the user might not have anticipated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user likely did the wrong thing by violating trust and privacy, even with good intentions. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
