At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a friend's mom about her sleeping around. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal details about her relationships. The author felt it was wrong and decided to inform the mother. The main issue here is confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, even if it's something others might consider inappropriate, the listener has a responsibility to keep it private unless there's a clear risk involved.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they put themselves in the mother's shoes and wanted to protect her. However, teenagers often make mistakes and explore their sexuality. The mother might not have been aware, but the author didn't consider if there was a safer way to address it, like talking to the friend directly about the consequences.\n\nAlso, the author didn't check if the friend was being harmed or coerced. Just because someone sleeps around doesn't mean they're in danger, unless there are other factors like underage drinking or unsafe practices. The author's action led to the friend cutting them off, which is a common reaction when trust is broken.\n\nSo, the key points are breach of trust, lack of direct intervention, and the impact on the friendship. The author overstepped by involving the parent without a valid reason of harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
