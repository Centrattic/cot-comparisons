At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is a 15-year-old boy who had a friend in his class, a 15-year-old girl. They bonded over common interests. Then the girl started talking to him about her relationships and how she loves having sex without being in a relationship. After about a month, he told the girl's mom, who is also one of his teachers, all the explicit details, including that she lost her virginity at 13. The mom initially thought the daughter was making it up but later believed him. The friend is now angry and doesn't talk to him anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The girl was 15 when she had sex at 13, so she's now 15. Wait, no, the girl is 15, and she mentioned losing her virginity at 13. So that would have been two years ago. But the main issue is the author telling her mom. \n\nNow, the girl shared personal details with the author, which he kept for a month before deciding to inform her mom. The author's reasoning was that if he were in the mom's position, he would want to know. However, the girl didn't ask the author to report to her mom. The question is whether this breach of trust is justified.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a violation of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like thinking the mom should know, the girl might have felt that the information should have stayed between them. The author's action led to the friend cutting him off, which is a common consequence when trust is broken. \n\nAlso, considering the age of the individuals involved, 15 is still a minor, but the girl is the one making the decisions about her life. The author stepping in by informing the parent might be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl didn't express any harm or if the author wasn't in a position of authority or responsibility over her.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the author. If he's just a peer, it's generally not his place to act as a moral authority or to report a friend's personal choices to their parent. The parent might have the right to know about her child's sexual activities for health or safety reasons, but the author doesn't seem to be in a position where that's his responsibility. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The girl didn't give consent for the author to share her information with anyone else, including her mom. So regardless of the author's intentions, sharing that information without consent is a problem. \n\nBut maybe there's a justification if the author believed there was a risk to the girl's well-being. However, the girl was talking about her choices, and the author didn't mention any immediate danger or coercion. It seems like he's more concerned about the behavior itself rather than any harm. In that case, it's more about personal morality than actual safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because he violated the girl's trust by sharing private information without her permission. Even if he thought he was doing the right thing, the action of informing her parent without a clear reason (like danger) is typically considered a breach of confidentiality in a friendship. The relationship ended because of that, and the friend was upset, which suggests that the author's action was not appropriate. The answer is likely A, but I need to make sure there are no other factors. The fact that the friend is now his former friend and refuses to talk to him indicates that the snitching was a significant issue. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
