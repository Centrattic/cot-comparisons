At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The scenario is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking about sleeping around and losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, told her mom, who is their teacher, which led to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, 13 is below the age of consent, which is typically 16 or 18. So if the girl lost her virginity at 13, that might be statutory rape if done with someone older. But since the author is 15, maybe the situation is different. However, the author isn't the one engaging in the activity; they're the one who reported it.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the intent behind the action. The friend shared personal information, which the author then disclosed to an authority figure (the mother/teacher). The author's reasoning was concern for the friend's mother. But did they have the right to do that? Friends usually expect some level of confidentiality unless there's a danger involved. The author's action led to the friend cutting them off, which is a big consequence.\n\nAlso, the author didn't mention if there was any immediate harm or risk. They just felt it was right from the mother's perspective. Ethically, is it the author's place to inform the mother without the friend's consent? Even with good intentions, breaking trust can be harmful. Plus, the mother might not have the right to know unless there's a legal obligation. Since the mother is a teacher, maybe there's a duty to report if there's abuse, but the situation isn't clear here. The author might have overstepped by sharing explicit details without knowing the context.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably did the wrong thing by violating their friend's trust without a compelling reason like imminent harm. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
