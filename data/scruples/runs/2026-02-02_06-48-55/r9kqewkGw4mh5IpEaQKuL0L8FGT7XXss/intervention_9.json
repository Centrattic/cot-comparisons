At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 15-year-old boy who became friends with another girl his age. They bonded over shared interests, and she started talking about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13 and her current relationship with a friend's guy. The author decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, all the details. Now, his friend is upset and won't talk to him. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by snitching.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age factor. Both the author and his friend are 15, which is a minor age, so their interactions are in a context where they might not have full legal autonomy. But in terms of moral responsibility, both are young. The friend's actions\u2014sleeping around, having a FWB, breaking up from that, and pursuing another relationship\u2014are things that, while perhaps controversial, might be considered private. However, the age of losing her virginity at 13 might be a point of concern depending on the legal age of consent, but since the author is also 15, maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that he put himself in the mother's shoes and thought the mother would want to know. The problem here is about confidentiality and trust. When someone shares personal information with you, especially in a friendship, there's an expectation that it will stay private unless there's a reason to involve others. The author felt the need to inform the mother, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if there's a genuine concern for the friend's well-being or safety, that could be a different angle. But in this case, the friend's actions don't necessarily indicate harm, just that she's sexually active and has multiple partners, which isn't illegal but might be morally or ethically concerning to others.\n\nThe mother's reaction is understandable\u2014she's worried about her daughter's behavior. But the author didn't consult the mother first; he just shared everything. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose private information shared by a friend. In most cases, unless there's a legal obligation (like child abuse or imminent harm), sharing such information without consent is a violation of privacy. The author's motives might be seen as trying to protect the friend by informing the mother, but that doesn't justify the breach of trust. The result is that the friendship is ruined, and the friend is upset, which is a common consequence of such disclosures.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the mother being a teacher. The author approached a teacher, which might be a conflict of interest since the teacher is also the mother. But the act itself is still about sharing private information. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by involving an authority figure, but in doing so, he betrayed his friend's trust. The question is whether the author overstepped by not discussing it with the friend first or seeking another form of help.\n\nIn many cases, friends share secrets expecting them to stay confidential. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, violated that trust. Even if the intention was to protect the friend's mom, it's not the friend's secret to share. The friend might have her reasons for not telling her mom, and the author's decision to do so without her consent is problematic. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
