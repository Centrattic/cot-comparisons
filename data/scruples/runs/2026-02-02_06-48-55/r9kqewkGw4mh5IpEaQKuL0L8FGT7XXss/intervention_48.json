At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The friend, who's a 15-year-old girl, told the author in detail that she sleeps around a lot, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, then told the girl's mom, who is also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a friend, so trust is a big part of that relationship. The friend shared personal information, which is something private. The author decided to share that with the mother, possibly out of concern for the friend's well-being, thinking the mother would want to know. But was that the right approach?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the girl is a minor, so her parents have a right to be informed about her activities to some extent. However, the author isn't a parent or an authority figure. The mother is also a teacher, so maybe the author thought there was a responsibility there. But did the author have the right to disclose such personal information without consent?\n\nEthically, sharing someone's private information without their permission can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was to help, the action itself violates the friend's privacy. The friend might feel betrayed, which explains why she's cutting off the author. The author didn't consult the friend or involve any other authority first, just went straight to the mother. That could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the age of the author and the girl is relevant. Both are 15, so they're minors themselves. They might not have the full maturity to handle such situations. The mother, being a parent and teacher, might have different responsibilities. But the author's role here is as a friend, not a parent or teacher. So the author's decision to act as a whistleblower without considering the friend's autonomy could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the friend shared her personal experiences expecting confidentiality. The author's disclosure could have caused emotional harm to the friend, leading to the loss of their friendship. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's benefit, the method was flawed. Perhaps the author should have discussed it with the friend first or involved a proper authority figure instead of the mother directly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the act of sharing private information without consent breaches trust and privacy. The friend's autonomy and right to privacy are important factors here. The author's actions likely contributed to the friend's distress and the breakdown of the friendship, which suggests the author is in the wrong.\n"
