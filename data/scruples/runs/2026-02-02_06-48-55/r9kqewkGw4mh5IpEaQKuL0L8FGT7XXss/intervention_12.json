At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 15-year-old boy told his friend's mom (who is also his teacher) about the girl's explicit details about sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared personal information with the author, who then decided to inform the mother. The key points here are confidentiality, the age of the individuals, and the role of the mother as a teacher.\n\nSince they're both 15, they're minors, and the teacher's role might complicate things. But the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information. The friend trusted the author with private details, and breaking that trust could be a problem. However, the author might have thought he was acting in the friend's best interest by involving a parent.\n\nBut wait, the mother is also the teacher. Does that mean she's in a position of authority and the author thought it was his duty to inform her? Or was it a personal decision? Also, the friend is 15, so there might be legal implications if the sexual activity involves underage relationships, but the author's role in reporting that isn't clear. However, the user is asking about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, sharing someone else's private information without consent is generally wrong. Even if the author thought he was right, the act of snitching without the friend's consent breaches trust. The friend's reaction (not talking anymore) shows the impact of breaking that trust. The author didn't consult the girl's mom directly but went through his own judgment, which might not be his place.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was a friend and then became a former friend suggests that the action was a breach of friendship. Unless there was immediate harm or danger, which isn't mentioned, the author's decision to inform the mother without a valid reason seems to be in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
