At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author (also 15) about her sexual activities and relationships. The author then reported this to the friend's mom, who is also their teacher.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and consent. The friend shared personal information with the author, expecting some level of confidentiality. By telling her mom, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought they were acting in the friend's best interest or their mom's, sharing such explicit details without permission is a breach of privacy.\n\nNext, the age factor is important. Both are 15, so they're minors. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which might be legal depending on the jurisdiction, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is the violation of trust. The author didn't ask the friend if she wanted to tell her mom; they just decided to do it on their own. That's a big no-no. \n\nThen there's the consequence: the friend is now upset and won't talk to the author anymore. The author might have thought they were helping, but without the friend's consent, it's considered a betrayal. In most cases, unless there's immediate harm or illegal activity, friends are expected to keep each other's secrets unless they're in a position to intervene (like if someone's in danger). Here, the situation doesn't mention any danger, just personal choices about relationships.\n\nAlso, considering the dynamic with the teacher: the mom is a teacher, so there might be a power imbalance. The author might have felt pressure to report, but that's not a valid reason without the student's consent. Teachers usually have a role in protecting students' privacy as well, unless there's a legal obligation to report something. Since the author isn't a teacher, they don't have that authority.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author shared private information without permission, leading to a broken friendship. Even if the intention was good, the action was a violation of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
