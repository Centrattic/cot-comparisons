At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was sharing explicit details about her sexual experiences and past relationships. The author, also 15, decided to tell the friend's mom, who is also their teacher, thinking that the mom should know in case she's concerned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust. When someone shares personal information, especially about their private life, they usually expect it to stay between them and the person they're talking to. By revealing that information without the friend's consent, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the act of sharing private details without permission is a breach of confidentiality. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's age. Both are 15, so they might not have a full grasp of the consequences of their actions. However, age doesn't absolve someone of responsibility in matters of trust and privacy. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she now refuses to talk to the author, which is a valid response to betrayal. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that they wanted to inform the mom as a protective measure, assuming the mom would be concerned. But that's making an assumption about the mom's intentions and the daughter's situation. The author might not know the family dynamics. The mom could have different views on her daughter's autonomy and privacy. The author didn't consult the mom directly but instead shared explicit details that might not be the mom's business unless there's a legal or safety concern. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a risk of harm or illegal activity, it's not appropriate to share someone else's private information. The author's actions led to the friend cutting off contact, which is a significant consequence. The key issue here is the violation of the friend's privacy and the breach of trust. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. Even if their intentions were good, the method of sharing private information without consent is problematic. The correct answer would be A.\n"
