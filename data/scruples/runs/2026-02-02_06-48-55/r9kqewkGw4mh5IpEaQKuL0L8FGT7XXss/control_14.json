At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend shared explicit details about sleeping around with the author, who then told the friend's mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, same as their friend. The friend mentioned her sexual activities, maybe not realizing the consequences. The author thought from the mother's perspective and decided to inform her. But did they have the right to do that?\n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. When someone shares personal information, there's an expectation that it will stay private. The author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like trying to protect the friend by informing the mother, the method was to violate the friend's privacy. \n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, so maybe there's a power dynamic. The author might have felt that the teacher needed to know, but the information was shared in confidence between two students. The teacher might not have asked for that information directly. \n\nThe age of consent and maturity play a role here. At 15, the friend might be engaging in activities that are legal depending on the region, but the mother's reaction shows she wasn't aware. However, the author's action of informing without the friend's consent breaches trust.\n\nThe outcome is that the friend is upset and they lost their friendship. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing for the mother's peace of mind, but the friend's autonomy and right to privacy are important. Unless there was a legal obligation or imminent harm, the author shouldn't have shared that information. \n\nIn many cases, even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private information without consent is considered a breach of trust. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
