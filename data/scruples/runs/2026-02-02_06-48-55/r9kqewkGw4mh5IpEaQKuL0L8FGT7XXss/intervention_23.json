At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old guy who became friends with a girl in his class. They bonded over shared interests, and the friend started talking about her sexual experiences, like sleeping around and a recent breakup. The author kept it to himself for a month but then decided to tell the friend's mom (who is also his teacher) the explicit details, including that she lost her virginity at 13. The mom initially didn't believe but later did, and now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, let's consider confidentiality. Friends share personal information expecting trust. By telling the friend's mom, the author breached that trust. Even if the friend was sharing voluntarily, the author had a responsibility to keep her secrets unless there's a legal or safety concern. \n\nNext, motive. The author says he thought from his friend's mom's perspective and wanted to inform her because he would want to know if he were in her position. But is that a valid reason? Privacy is important. Unless there's harm involved, like abuse, it's not typically someone else's place to inform parents. \n\nAge is a factor. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which is under 16, but the legal age in many places is higher (like 16 or 18). Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about reporting underage sexual activity, but the author isn't a legal authority. If the author had a legitimate reason to report a crime, that's different. But the friend isn't a minor in this context\u2014she's 15, same as the author. Wait, the friend is 15, and lost her virginity at 13. That might be a legal issue. If the friend had sex when she was 13, that's under the age of consent in most places, so it could be statutory rape. In that case, the author might have a legal obligation to report. But the author is also 15, so he's not in a position to report that. However, if the mother is the parent, maybe the author thought the mom should know about her daughter's past actions. But the friend is 15, so the mom is her legal guardian. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author isn't a parent or authority figure. The friend shared personal information with the author, expecting confidentiality. The author's decision to share that with the mother without a legal mandate is a breach of trust. Even if the motive was to protect the friend from her mother's disapproval, the method was inappropriate. The friend's privacy and autonomy are important. \n\nAlso, the friend is 15, same age as the author. They might not be in a position to judge what a parent should know. The mother is a teacher, so there's a power dynamic there. The author might have felt compelled to tell the teacher because of her role, but teachers are supposed to maintain confidentiality unless there's a safety issue. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal, non-safety-related information.\n\nIn terms of consequences, the friend is now upset and the author lost her trust. The friend's actions (sleeping around, FWB) might be her choice, even if some people disapprove. The author's intervention could be seen as invasive and not the author's place. Unless there's a legal requirement to report, the author's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely did wrong by violating the friend's confidentiality without a valid legal or safety reason. The friend's choices, even if controversial, are her own, and the author wasn't the one to decide to inform her mother. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
