At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The author is 15, same as their friend. They became friends because they shared common interests. The friend started talking about her sex life, including sleeping around, losing virginity at 13, and now trying to get with her BFF's guy. The author, after some time, decided to tell the mom (who's also a teacher) all these details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, so legal implications might be different. The friend shared personal information with the author, which is confidential. By sharing that with the mother, the author breached the friend's privacy. But the author's reasoning was based on empathy\u2014trying to be a good friend by considering the mother's perspective.\n\nIn many places, there's a legal duty to report certain things if there's abuse or underage activity. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which in many jurisdictions is below the age of consent. If that's the case, then the mother might need to know for the daughter's safety. However, the author might not be in the position to judge, and reporting without the friend's consent could damage trust.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend trusted the author with private information, and sharing it without consent is a breach of trust, regardless of the content. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of snitching without considering the friend's autonomy is problematic. The mother might have a right to know if her child is in danger, but the author isn't necessarily the one to decide that. Also, the friend is 15, so both are minors, and their relationships might be influenced by peer pressure or immaturity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believed they were protecting the friend or her family, there's a moral argument there. But overall, trust and privacy are key in friendships. By breaking that trust, the author caused a fallout. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the breach of confidentiality, even if the motive was concern.\n"
