At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the user, a 15-year-old boy, told his friend's mom (who is also his teacher) about her daughter's explicit sexual activities. He did this after considering his friend's mom's perspective and thinking he'd want to know if it were his own mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is 15, which is a minor, so there's a question about consent to share her private information. Even though the friend shared details with him, does that mean he's allowed to share them with others? Probably not, because privacy is a big deal. Minors might not fully understand the implications of sharing such information, and their friends aren't necessarily authorized to act as whistleblowers.\n\nNext, the mother is also a teacher, which adds a layer of authority. The user might think that as a teacher, the mother should be informed, but usually, teachers have a duty to protect students' privacy unless there's a risk of harm. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which in some places might be a legal concern if under the age of consent. However, the user isn't in a position to report that unless there's abuse or illegal activity. But the user isn't alleging abuse; just that the girl is \"sleeping around,\" which is more about personal choice than legality.\n\nThe key issue here is unauthorized disclosure of private information. Even if the user had good intentions, sharing someone else's secrets without their consent is a breach of trust. The friend's reaction is understandable because trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. By snitching, the user violated that trust, leading to the friendship breaking down.\n\nAnother angle is the user's age and maturity. At 15, both he and his friend are teenagers, which means they might not have the full judgment of adults. However, the act of sharing personal secrets, regardless of age, crosses ethical boundaries. The mother being a teacher complicates things because there might be institutional policies about reporting, but again, unless there's a clear risk, the teacher should handle it appropriately without a student's input.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, depending on jurisdiction, there might be laws about reporting child welfare issues. But if the situation doesn't involve abuse, a student isn't typically required to report a peer's sexual behavior. The line for mandatory reporting is for harm or abuse, not for personal choices, even if they're risky.\n\nEthically, the user acted without considering his friend's autonomy. She might have chosen to share her experiences with him in confidence, and he didn't have the right to disclose that. Even if he thought he was protecting her mother, the method was inappropriate. The mother could have addressed the issue herself if she found out through other means, but the user overstepped by involving her directly without consent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's action was a breach of trust and privacy, leading to the loss of a friendship. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
