At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves a 15-year-old friend who talks in detail about sleeping around, and the author decides to tell her mom, who is also a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend shared personal information about her sexual activities. The author, thinking from her mom's perspective, decides to inform the mother. The result is that the friend is upset and the relationship is broken. The author is 15, same age as the friend.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to share confidential information that was trustingly given. The friend told the author private details, expecting some level of confidentiality. By telling her mom, the author breached that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing from the mom's perspective, the act of sharing without consent is a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. Both are minors, so the situation is about peer relationships. The author's intention might be seen as trying to protect the friend by informing the mother, but that's a big assumption. The mother might not have wanted to know, and the friend's autonomy is important. Also, the mother is a teacher, so there might be a power dynamic here. The author might feel it's okay because the teacher is also the mother, but that's still a violation of the friend's privacy.\n\nLegal considerations: In some places, confidentiality between minors is expected unless there's a risk of harm. Since the friend is engaging in sexual activity, there might be concerns about underage sex, but the author isn't reporting abuse or danger, just the friend's behavior. The author isn't a legal guardian, so they can't make decisions about the friend's life. \n\nEthically, the author took a role as a judge and reporter, which isn't their place. The friend might not want her mom to know, and the author's action caused a rift. Even if the author's intention was good, the method was inappropriate. The friend's trust was broken, leading to losing the friendship. \n\nPossible defenses: Maybe the author thought it was necessary for the mom to know, but that's a heavy decision. However, the author isn't in a position to decide that. The friend could have been upset regardless, but the author didn't check with her first.\n\nIn conclusion, the author violated the friend's privacy and trust by sharing personal information without consent, leading to the friendship's end. The action was not justified, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
