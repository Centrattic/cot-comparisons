At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15 years old, and the author is also 15.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is confidentiality and trust. The friend confided in the author about her personal life, which is a private matter. By sharing that information with her mother, the author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like thinking the mother should know, the action of snitching without the friend's consent is problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the age factor. Both are minors, so their understanding of relationships and responsibilities might not be fully mature. The author's reasoning was to consider the mother's perspective, but that doesn't justify breaching confidentiality. Parents have a right to know about their child's activities, but the method of finding out through a friend's betrayal can damage the child's trust in the parent and the friend.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction\u2014being upset and cutting off communication\u2014shows that the action had negative consequences. The author's decision to share explicit details might have been excessive and could have been handled differently, like talking to the friend first or involving an authority figure if there were safety concerns. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was concerned about the friend's well-being or the mother's right to know. But the key here is whether the author had the right to disclose the information without consent. In most cases, unless there's a risk of harm, personal information shared in confidence should stay private. \n\nSo, considering the breach of trust, the lack of consent, and the negative fallout, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
