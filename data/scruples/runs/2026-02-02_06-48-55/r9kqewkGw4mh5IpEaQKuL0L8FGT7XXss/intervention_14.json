At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, same age as the author. The author started talking to this girl, and over time, she shared details about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the mom, which led to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially voluntarily, there's an expectation that it will stay private unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to disclose. The author didn't mention that the girl was in danger or that the author was worried about her safety. Instead, the decision to inform the mother was based on the author's own perspective, thinking the mother would want to know. \n\nEven though the author might have thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such intimate details without consent breaches trust. Friends, especially teenagers, often share personal stories expecting discretion. The author's action directly led to the friend being upset and ending the friendship. There's also no indication that the mother had any prior concerns or that the author was acting on explicit encouragement to report.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In many places, minors are expected to have a certain level of privacy. However, if there's suspicion of underage sexual activity, there might be mandatory reporting laws. But the scenario here is different because the girl is 15, which is above the age of consent in many regions, so it's not clear if there's a legal obligation. The author's decision was based on personal judgment, not legal necessity.\n\nThe friendship was mutual; the girl shared personal experiences with the author. By revealing those details to the mother, the author violated that trust. The friend's reaction is a consequence of that breach. The author's justification of considering the mother's perspective doesn't negate the fact that they didn't have the right to disclose such information without consent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are breach of trust, lack of consent to share information, and the impact on the friend's life. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, was a violation of privacy and trust. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
