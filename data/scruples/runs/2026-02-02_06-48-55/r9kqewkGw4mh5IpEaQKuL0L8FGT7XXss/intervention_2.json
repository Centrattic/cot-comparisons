At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom (who's also his teacher) that his 15-year-old female friend sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust. When someone shares personal details with you, especially in a friendship, there's an implicit trust that you won't share those things with others. The author heard explicit details about his friend's sexual activities and then went to her mom. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, he violated the friend's trust. \n\nNext, the age factor. Both the author and his friend are 15, which is a minor. Their understanding of privacy and consequences might be developing. However, the act of disclosing private information without consent is a breach of confidentiality regardless of age. Even if the mother is a teacher, that doesn't necessarily give the author the right to share personal details. The mother might have her own role in addressing her daughter's behavior, but it's not the friend's place to act as a go-between.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is significant. She's upset and cut off contact, indicating that the disclosure hurt her. The author might have thought he was protecting the friend or the mother, but it's not his decision to make. Unless there was immediate harm or danger (like underage sex involving minors, which could be a legal issue), the author overstepped.\n\nUnderage sexual activity is a sensitive area. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be legal implications if she's engaging with someone older. But the author isn't in a position to assess that; that's the parent's or authorities' role. The author's action could be seen as tattling rather than reporting a legal issue. \n\nThe mother's initial disbelief and later belief show that the author's disclosure led to real consequences for his friend. The friend's privacy was compromised, and the relationship was damaged. The author didn't seek to understand his friend's perspective or the reasons behind her actions before deciding to inform the mother. \n\nIn summary, the key points are breach of trust, lack of consent to share personal information, and the resulting harm to the friendship. Unless there was a legal obligation to report, which isn't clear here, the author's actions were wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
