At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's talking about sleeping around, and the author told the mom in explicit details. The friend now refuses to talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a friend and had a conversation with her where the girl shared personal information. The author then decided to inform the mother, thinking about the mother's perspective. But the key here is whether the author had a right to do that.\n\nConfidentiality is important in friendships. If someone shares personal details with you, even if they're inappropriate, the expectation is that you'll keep it private unless there's a risk of harm. The author's reasoning was that they wanted to protect the mother, but does that justify breaking trust? The girl mentioned losing her virginity at 13, which might be a legal issue if it's under the age of consent in their area. If that's the case, then the mother might need to know, but the author's responsibility might be to the legal authority, not the mother personally. However, the story says the mother is a teacher, so maybe there's a mandatory reporting aspect if there's underage activity. But the author's role as a 15-year-old might not require them to report unless it's a legal obligation.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the mother, but without checking if the mother should be informed through appropriate channels. Telling the mother directly could be a breach of trust, especially if the girl didn't consent to that information being shared. The friend is now cut off, which is a consequence of the author's action. The author might not have considered the girl's autonomy and right to privacy, even if the behavior is something the mother would disapprove of.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is empathy\u2014trying to see it from the mother's perspective. But that doesn't necessarily give them the right to act as a go-between. The mother should be informed through the proper channels if there's a concern, not through a teenager's discretion. Plus, the girl's actions, while potentially risky or inappropriate, are her personal choices. Unless there's immediate danger or illegal activity, the author's intervention might be overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong because they broke their friend's trust without a valid reason that required third-party intervention. The right action would have been to maybe talk to an adult about the concern, not directly to the mother. Therefore, answer A.\n"
