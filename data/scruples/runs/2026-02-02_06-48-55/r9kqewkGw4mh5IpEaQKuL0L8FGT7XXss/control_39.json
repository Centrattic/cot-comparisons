At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old boy who befriended a girl they have a lot in common with. The friend started talking about her relationships and sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The user decided to tell her mom, who is also their teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend shared personal information, which the user took seriously. The user thought from the mother's perspective and felt the mom should know. However, the user didn't confront the friend directly or check if the mom was already aware. The friend was upset, and the user's action caused a rift.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, a 15-year-old isn't a legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to report such things unless there's a legal obligation. Since the mother is the teacher, maybe the school has policies about reporting, but the user isn't an adult. Ethically, sharing personal info without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the user thought they were doing the right thing, they violated the friend's privacy. The friend might feel betrayed. The user could have handled it differently, like talking to a trusted adult first or the friend's parent through proper channels. Since the user didn't do that, and acted on their own, it's a breach of confidentiality. So, the answer is A (the user is in the wrong).\n"
