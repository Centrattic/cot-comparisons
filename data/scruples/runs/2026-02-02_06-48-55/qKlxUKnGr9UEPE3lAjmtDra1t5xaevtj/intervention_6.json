I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a friend who led the author on, got flirty, went on dates, and slept together, but then rejected her when she wanted a real relationship. The key point here is that Aaron told the author he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a code for fat girls. She confronts him, he confirms it, she gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and then spams him with memes. He responds by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author feels she was led on, which is a valid concern. If Aaron was flirting and acting like there was a romantic connection, then rejecting her based on her size could be seen as using her for a fling and then being dismissive. That's pretty hurtful. On the other hand, the author responded aggressively, calling him names and spamming him, which could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut wait, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a backhanded way of saying he's not attracted to fat women, which is a form of body shaming. The author was justified in confronting him about that. However, her response of spamming him with memes and name-calling might have been excessive. While his comment was hurtful, her actions could be seen as retaliatory and not the best way to handle the situation.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she had the right to express her hurt and confront his comment. On the other, her method of doing so might have been inappropriate. The line between standing up for oneself and being an asshole can be thin. If she was hurt and felt manipulated, her reaction is understandable. But shaming him publicly might not be the healthiest approach. However, given that Aaron made a derogatory comment about her weight, her response might be a reaction to a toxic attitude.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the moderators often look at intent and proportionality. Did the author intend to hurt Aaron? It seems like she was reacting to being rejected and feeling led on. Her actions, while harsh, might be a result of emotional distress. Aaron's comment is the real issue here. The author isn't wrong for calling out his comment, but her method of doing so (spamming with memes and name-calling) is questionable. However, given that Aaron made a derogatory remark, the author's reaction is a response to being judged and mistreated.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because her reaction was to a hurtful comment, even if her method was harsh. Alternatively, maybe A because she could have handled it better. But I think in this case, the main issue is Aaron's body shaming, and the author's reaction, while not perfect, is a response to that. So B.\n"
