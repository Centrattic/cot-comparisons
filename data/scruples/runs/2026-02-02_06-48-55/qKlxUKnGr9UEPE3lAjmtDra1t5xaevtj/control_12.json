I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's been leading her on with flirtatious behavior and even sleeping in the same bed, which she considers dates. Then, when she wants to take things further, he says he's not interested because she doesn't work out, which she interprets as a comment on her weight. She calls him out, he says she's making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and she responds with memes related to body positivity. He says she's an asshole for making him feel like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author sees as a fat-shaming comment. She confronts him, and he doesn't apologize. She then spams him with memes that are critical of that attitude, which he says made him feel bad. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, she was already in a situation where he led her on with flirty behavior and physical intimacy. When she wanted to commit, he rejected her based on her weight. That's clearly hurtful and maybe even discriminatory. She called him out for fat-shaming, which is a valid reaction. The memes she sent are about body positivity and holding people accountable for their comments. So from her perspective, she's standing up for herself against a harmful stereotype.\n\nOn the other hand, he claims that his comment was about his personal preferences, not fat-shaming. If he genuinely believes he's not attracted to someone who doesn't work out, maybe he's just stating his preference, even if it's not the best way to put it. But if she took it as a fat-shaming comment and he didn't clarify or apologize, that's part of the problem. Also, she's sending memes that criticize him, which he finds hurtful. The question is whether her response is justified.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: he led her on, then rejected her based on her weight, she confronts him, and then uses memes to call him out. The guy says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" implying he's not responsible for his comments. The author's actions could be seen as holding him accountable for discriminatory comments, which is reasonable. However, spamming him with memes might be excessive, but given the context, it's a reaction to being hurt. So the author might not be in the wrong because she's defending herself against fat-shaming and a lead-up situation. The guy's comment is problematic regardless of his intent, and her response is about asserting her worth and challenging his harmful comment. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
