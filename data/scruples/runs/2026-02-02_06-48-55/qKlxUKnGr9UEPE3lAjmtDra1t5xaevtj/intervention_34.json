I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who told the author he would be his ideal girlfriend but then said he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then reacts strongly, calls him a piece of shit, and starts spamming him with memes. Aaron responds by saying the author made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Aaron had a flirty, date-like relationship. The author felt led on, so when Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship, the author pushed for more details. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a euphemism for body size, which the author directly called out. Aaron then clarified he meant because the author is fat. \n\nThe author's reaction was intense: yelling, calling Aaron a piece of shit, spamming him with memes. That's pretty harsh. But is the author in the wrong for reacting to being called out on what could be considered a discriminatory or hurtful comment? \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron might have felt that the author was attacking his personal preferences, which he framed as \"natural desires.\" The author might feel justified in confronting him about what they perceive as a prejudiced statement. However, the way the author responded\u2014using aggressive language and spamming\u2014could be seen as overreacting, even if the comment was hurtful. \n\nBut is the author responsible for making Aaron feel bad if Aaron's statement was problematic? If Aaron made a derogatory comment about the author's body, then the author's anger is a valid response. The key is whether the author's actions were a justified reaction to being insulted. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author was in a situation where they felt led on and then faced a discriminatory comment. Their response, while harsh, might be seen as a reaction to being mistreated. However, the method of response (spamming, insults) could be problematic. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author's actions were justified. \n\nIf Aaron made a comment that is clearly about the author's weight, then the author is not wrong for being upset. The problem is the way they expressed it, but the initial wrongdoing was Aaron's comment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to being treated poorly. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
