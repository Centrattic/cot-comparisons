I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend, Aaron, who told the author he considers her his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then responds by calling him a piece of shit and sending memes, leading Aaron to accuse her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron had a flirty, almost dating relationship. When the author wants to take it further, Aaron says he's not into a relationship. The author confronts him, and he says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she takes as fat-shaming. She responds angrily, spamming him with memes, and he calls her an asshole for making him feel bad.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides. On one hand, Aaron made a comment that the author interprets as fat-shaming. If he's using \"girls who don't work out\" as a euphemism for weight, that's a problem. Fat-shaming is a serious issue, and calling someone out for that isn't inherently wrong. The author was in a position where she felt led on, which adds emotional distress. Her reaction of anger and sending memes might be seen as confrontational, but if she was hurt, her response could be justified as self-defense or expressing her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron claims he was stating his \"natural desires,\" which some might argue is a personal preference. However, using such language can be discriminatory. The author's response was to call him out for making her feel bad about her body, which he now turns the accusation back on her. The key here is whether his comment was a legitimate preference or a form of discrimination. If it's the latter, then the author had a right to be upset.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of the relationship, the author felt led on by Aaron's actions and words. When she confronted him, his response was hurtful and potentially discriminatory. Her reaction, while perhaps harsh, was in response to being called fat-shaming. The memes she sent are a form of expressing her anger, which might be seen as immature, but given the context, it's a common reaction to hurt.\n\nIn terms of who is wrong, it seems like Aaron made the hurtful comment first. The author was responding to being insulted. While her response might be seen as aggressive, the initial wrongdoing is on Aaron's side. The author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against what she perceives as fat-shaming. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
