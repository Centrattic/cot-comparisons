I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who made a comment about the author being his ideal girlfriend but then also said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author felt led on and responded angrily, sending memes and being harsh. Aaron then called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a flirty, possibly more-than-friends relationship with Aaron. When she wanted to take things further, he said he wasn't into a relationship but then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out. The author took that as a fat-shaming comment and reacted strongly, spamming him with memes. He responded by calling her an asshole for making him feel bad. The author is conflicted, feeling both bad and justified.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron initially led the author on with flirtatious behavior and dates, making her think there was a romantic possibility. When she expressed her feelings, he rejected her but did so in a way that was dismissive and possibly hurtful. The comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a way of avoiding the real issue, especially if his attraction is based on weight rather than fitness. Weight stigma is real, and such comments can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction was to lash out with memes that are clearly related to body shaming. While Aaron's comment was hurtful, the author's response of spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive and retaliatory. However, she was hurt and felt disrespected. The question is whether her reaction crosses the line into being the asshole. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment was inappropriate and contributed to the conflict. On the other hand, the author's response, while understandable given the hurt, could be seen as crossing a line by making him feel like shit, even if his comment was the trigger. However, if Aaron's comment was a form of fat-shaming, then the author's response might be a justified stand against that negativity. \n\nBut the key here is that the author was led on by Aaron's flirtatious behavior, leading her to believe there was a possibility of a relationship. Then, when she was rejected, she felt disrespected and wanted to call out the fat-shaming. Her response, while perhaps aggressive, was in reaction to being led on and then faced with a hurtful comment. However, the way she responded (spamming with memes) might be seen as overly harsh. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have some responsibility. Aaron for leading her on and making a fat-shaming comment, and the author for responding in a way that made him feel attacked. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate. Making someone feel bad for making a hurtful comment can be justified, but using spam and harsh memes might be excessive. However, given that Aaron's comment was a form of body shaming, which is a serious issue, the author might feel justified in calling him out. \n\nBut the author's own behavior (spamming, using aggressive memes) could be seen as crossing a line. Even if Aaron was in the wrong, the author's response might be considered the asshole behavior. However, if the author is standing up against fat shaming, which is a valid stance, then maybe her response is justified. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The initial wrong is on Aaron's side for leading her on and fat-shaming. The author's response is aggressive but in reaction to that. Depending on perspective, the author could be seen as in the right for calling out the fat shaming, even if her method was harsh. Alternatively, her response could be seen as excessive. \n\nGiven that the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether her actions were disproportionate. If the author's reaction is seen as a justified defense against fat shaming, then she's not in the wrong. If her response is seen as unnecessarily harsh, then she might be in the wrong. Since the context includes him leading her on, which adds to the hurt, it's possible that the author's reaction is a mix of justified anger and overreaction. \n\nBut the core issue is the fat shaming. If the author is making him feel bad for his natural desires, which he claims are just his preferences, she's challenging his right to hold those views. However, if his views are harmful (fat shaming), then her reaction is valid. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often debate both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If her actions are seen as retaliatory and hurtful, then yes. If seen as standing up against harmful comments, then no. Given the scenario, the author's actions might be seen as justified in calling out the fat shaming, even if the method was harsh. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that her response was the asshole part. \n\nBut considering the initial wrongdoing by Aaron, the author's response is a reaction to being disrespected. In AITA terms, the person who led on and fat-shamed is the main asshole. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are a reaction to that. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
