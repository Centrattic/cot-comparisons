I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship. The author thought they were moving towards a more serious relationship. But when they had a conversation where the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he's happy just being friends and isn't into relationships. Then he said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, he admits it's about her being fat, and the author responds by calling him a piece of shit and spamming his social media with memes about body size. Aaron then says she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron ended the relationship and tried to explain his feelings. He might feel that he was honest, even if it was harsh. The author feels led on because of the flirty behavior and dates, so when Aaron pulls back, she's hurt and angry. The author's response is to call him out and spam him with memes. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a body-shaming statement. He's using a euphemism to say the author is fat and he's not into her because of that. That's definitely rude and could be considered discriminatory. The author has a right to be upset about being led on and then being rejected with such a comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to call him a piece of shit and spam him with memes. Even though the author has a valid reason for being upset, the way she responded might be seen as aggressive or bullying. While Aaron's comment was hurtful, retaliating by spamming him could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was in a situation where she felt rejected and humiliated. The comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a clear body-shaming statement, which is hurtful and rude. The author's reaction is a response to being made to feel bad about her body and being led on. However, her method of responding might be considered excessive. While her feelings are valid, spamming someone with memes after a breakup, even if it's in response to hurtful comments, can be seen as unkind and not the best way to handle the situation.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about her actions. She had the right to express her hurt and anger, but the method of doing so (spamming) might be problematic. However, she was responding to a hurtful comment. So it's a bit of a gray area. In AITA scenarios, people often consider if the person's actions were proportionate. The author's actions, while maybe a bit over the top, were in response to being body-shamed and led on. So maybe she's not the asshole because Aaron made a bad comment first. But then again, her response might have been uncalled for. It's a tough call.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a situation where she was being rejected, and the reason given was based on her body size. That's a sensitive issue. The author's reaction could be seen as defending her self-worth, which is understandable. However, the method of responding might not be the healthiest. But in terms of right and wrong, the main issue is Aaron's comment. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but perhaps her actions in spaming could be seen as unkind. But given that Aaron called her fat and was dismissive, maybe she's justified in her anger.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Because Aaron made a hurtful and discriminatory comment, and while her response was aggressive, it's a reaction to being treated poorly. The main fault lies with Aaron for the body-shaming. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
