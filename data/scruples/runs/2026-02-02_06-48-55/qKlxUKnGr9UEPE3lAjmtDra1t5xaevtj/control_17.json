I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves Aaron, who the author is in a flirty, almost dating relationship with. Aaron ends things by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him, calls him a piece of shit, and spams him with memes, leading to Aaron blocking her and calling her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The author points out that Aaron led her on with flirty behavior and dates, implying a deeper relationship, before rejecting her. When she confronted him, he gave a vague reason that could be seen as body-shaming. She then reacted emotionally by calling him names and spamming him. Aaron, on the other hand, blocked her but called her an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" which might be his way of justifying body-shaming.\n\nNow, considering the key points: leading someone on is a clear issue. If Aaron was in a flirty, dating-like relationship but wasn't honest about his feelings, that's on him. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a form of body shaming, which is generally considered unacceptable. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to being led on and then body-shamed. However, spamming someone with memes and using offensive language might be crossing a line, even if the initial reason is justified.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are Aaron's dishonesty and body-shaming versus the author's emotional response. The author's actions in the moment (calling him a piece of shit, spamming) could be seen as reactive and hurt, which is understandable, but maybe the way she handled it wasn't the best. However, Aaron's behavior in leading her on and making a discriminatory remark is definitely wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author did something wrong. If it's B, then the author isn't. Given that Aaron's actions were worse (leading on, body-shaming), the author's reaction, while maybe not the best, is a response to being wronged. However, the spamming and aggressive communication could be seen as the author's fault. But the root of the problem is Aaron's behavior. So the answer might be B because the author isn't in the wrong for responding to being mistreated, even if her response was harsh. Alternatively, if the author's actions are considered equally wrong, then A. But since the question is about who is the asshole, and Aaron's actions are more egregious, the author isn't the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
