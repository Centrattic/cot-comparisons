I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy named Aaron who expressed interest in the author in a flirtatious way, had a close relationship, and then when the author wanted to take things further, he declined, citing that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a comment on her weight. The author then responded angrily, called him a lot of names, and sent memes about being fat, which led to Aaron blocking her and saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author felt that Aaron led her on, meaning he gave signals that he was interested in a more serious relationship but then backed out. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be perceived as a way to avoid hurting her feelings, but the author took it as a direct jab at her weight. That's a valid point because such comments can be hurtful and may have a double meaning. However, Aaron's statement about his \"natural desires\" suggests he's defending his preference, which could be seen as a personal choice, even if it's not kind.\n\nOn the author's side, she reacted strongly by spamming him with messages and using memes that might be confrontational. While she has the right to express her hurt and anger, the method of doing so\u2014spamming and aggressive messages\u2014might be excessive. However, she was clearly hurt and felt disrespected, so her reaction is understandable in that context.\n\nThe key points are: Did Aaron lead her on? If so, maybe he's equally at fault. But the question is about the author's actions. She confronted him, called him names, and sent messages after he blocked her. While she has the right to be upset, the way she handled it (spamming and aggressive posts) could be seen as over the top. However, if Aaron's comment was a clear put-down based on her weight, her reaction is justified in terms of self-respect. The answer might depend on whether the author's response was proportionate. But given that Aaron had been in a flirtatious relationship with her, the author might not be entirely wrong in her reaction. But the line between expressing hurt and being an asshole is thin here. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, considering both their actions, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because Aaron's comment was hurtful, but her response was also harsh. However, the user initially thought the author was wrong, but given the context, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she was defending against his comment, even if her method was aggressive. Alternatively, maybe A because she retaliated in a way that made Aaron feel bad. Hmm. It's a tough call. The key is whether he led her on. If he was actively leading her on, then her reaction is more justified. If he's just expressing his preference honestly, she's overreacting. The scenario says he said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which could be a way to avoid the relationship, but if that's his genuine feeling, maybe she's being too harsh. But the fact that he's been in a flirty, date-like relationship with her complicates things. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because Aaron's comment was discriminatory and hurtful, and she had a right to express her feelings, even if her method was aggressive. So the answer would be B.\n"
