I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call her \"Author,\" has been in a flirtatious relationship with Aaron for a few months. They go on dates and sleep in the same bed, so the Author feels like it's more than just friends. Then, after binge-watching a show, she wants to take things to the next level. Aaron says he's happy just being friends, but they've been leading her on with flirty behavior. \n\nWhen the Author pushes, he says he's not into a relationship with her and mentions not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a fat-shaming comment. She confronts him, and he confirms she's right. She gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and starts spamming him with memes. He blocks her but says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The Author feels conflicted\u2014half bad but also like she said what needed to be said.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron led the Author on with flirtatious behavior, then rejected her by using a fat-shaming comment. The Author confronted him, which made him feel bad. Now the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Aaron's comment was valid. Saying someone isn't attracted to non-gym-goers (implying fat people) is a classic fat-shaming remark. That's pretty much always a no-go in any relationship context. The Author was right to be upset because it's not just about her size but the fact that he used a backhanded way to reject her, which is hurtful.\n\nThen, when she confronted him, she called him names and spammed him with memes. That's aggressive, but maybe understandable given the context. However, the question is whether her response made her the asshole. She was reacting to being rejected in a hurtful way. In some cases, people might see her as overreacting, but given the initial insult, maybe it's justified.\n\nBut let's think about the other side. Aaron said he's not attracted to her, which is a valid reason for not wanting a relationship. However, the way he phrased it was dismissive and fat-shaming. The Author's reaction was to be angry and confront him, which could be seen as appropriate because she's standing up for herself. \n\nHowever, her response of spamming him with memes and calling him names could be seen as crossing a line, even if he was in the wrong. Sometimes, the way we respond, even when wronged, can affect our responsibility. But given that he was using a fat-shaming comment to reject her, her anger is understandable. The question is whether her actions were proportionate. \n\nIn many relationships or dating scenarios, when someone is rejected with a hurtful comment, it's common for the person to feel anger and respond in kind. Whether that makes them the asshole depends on societal norms. Some might argue that confronting someone for fat-shaming is justified. Others might say that responding with aggressive messages is not the right approach, even if the other person is wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the main issue is Aaron's fat-shaming comment, which is the root of the problem. The Author's response, while aggressive, was in reaction to that. Therefore, maybe she's not in the wrong because he started it with a harmful comment. Alternatively, her response could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nBut in terms of who's the asshole, the term usually refers to the person who is more in the wrong in the situation. Since Aaron made the hurtful comment and then blamed the Author for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" which is a bit of a cop-out, he's probably the asshole. However, the question is whether the Author is in the wrong. If she's not, then the answer is B. If she did do something wrong, then A.\n\nAnother angle: the Author was led on by Aaron with flirty behavior, which could be seen as manipulation. If he led her on and then used a backhanded reason to reject her, she's justified in being upset. Her aggressive response might be seen as a reaction to being manipulated and insulted. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
