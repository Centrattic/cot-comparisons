I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a friend named Aaron who told the author that she's his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, they had a conflict, and now she's sending memes and messages, leading to Aaron blocking her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author felt Aaron was leading her on by being flirty and going on what she considered dates. When she wanted a relationship, he rejected her and made a comment about her not working out, which she took as fat-shaming. She then expressed her anger through messages. Aaron felt she was being an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron's rejection and his comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, the author's response of sending memes, and the mutual accusations. \n\nIs fat-shaming acceptable? Definitely not. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a form of fat-shaming, even if he didn't use explicit words. It's a common coded language to refer to weight. The author's reaction is understandable because she felt disrespected and rejected based on her body.\n\nBut then, the author sent memes that were critical of Aaron's stance, which he found offensive. The question is whether her response was in the wrong. She was defending herself against what she saw as a derogatory comment. Her messages were in response to his hurtful statement. However, spamming him with memes might be aggressive, but given the context of being hurt, it's a common reaction.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the one in the wrong. From a standpoint of respect, both parties might have acted in ways that could be criticized. Aaron for fat-shaming and rejecting her without sensitivity, and the author for retaliating with memes. But in terms of being in the wrong, the initial wrong was Aaron's comment. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to being disrespected. However, there's a line between expressing anger and being an asshole. If the author's messages were meant to insult him personally, that's where she might cross into being wrong. But given that she was calling out fat-shaming, which is a valid issue, her response could be seen as justified.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate to Aaron's initial wrong. If Aaron made a hurtful comment, the author's reaction, while aggressive, is in response to a more serious issue. But she could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since Aaron made a fat-shaming comment, the author isn't the one initially in the wrong. Her retaliation might be harsh, but the main issue is Aaron's fat-shaming. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because Aaron's actions were the primary fault, and her response is in self-defense. However, some might argue that her method of retaliation was inappropriate. But given the context, she's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
