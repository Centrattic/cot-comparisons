I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship for months. They sleep in the same bed, go on dates, etc. Then Aaron says he's happy just being friends and isn't into a relationship. The author pushes, and Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts Aaron, who confirms it's because she's fat. The author then calls Aaron a piece of shit, blocks him, and spams his Facebook with memes. Aaron later says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Aaron made a hurtful comment about her body, which is a valid issue. The author was hurt and reacted emotionally. Calling someone a \"piece of shit\" and spamming them with memes is pretty harsh. Also, using Facebook to express anger might be unprofessional or inappropriate, depending on the context. But if he's already blocked her, maybe that's less of an issue. However, the author is also in a position where Aaron led her on with flirtatious behavior and then rejected her, which can be considered leading someone on.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a judgment based on appearance, which is not cool. The author has every right to be upset and express that. The reaction of calling him names and spamming might be excessive, but it's in the heat of the moment. People often act impulsively when hurt.\n\nSo, considering the context, Aaron's behavior was definitely inappropriate. The author had a right to be angry. However, the way she responded (calling him a piece of shit, spamming) might be considered over the top. But given the emotional context, it's a common reaction. The question is whether that makes her the asshole. \n\nIn these types of situations, the key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. Yelling and name-calling can be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked. But if Aaron was being cruel, the author's reaction is understandable. It's a toss-up. However, usually in these scenarios, if someone is being mean, the other person reacting emotionally is sometimes seen as justified. The key point is that Aaron's comment was the trigger. The author's actions, while harsh, were a direct response to being insulted. \n\nSo I think the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong. Aaron made a hurtful comment, and she had the right to express her anger. The harshness of her response might be excessive, but given the context, she's not the asshole here.\n"
