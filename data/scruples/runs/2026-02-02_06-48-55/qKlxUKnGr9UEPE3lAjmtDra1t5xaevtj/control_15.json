I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation with her friend Aaron. So, first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe author and Aaron have been friends for a few months, but their relationship has been described as more than friends\u2014flirty, going on dates, even sleeping in the same bed. That sounds like a close, possibly romantic relationship, even if not officially labeled. Then, the author thought it was time to take things to the next level, so she brought it up. Aaron said he's happy just being friends and not into a relationship. She pushed, and he said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, implying she's fat. She confronted him, he admitted it, and she was upset. She then sent memes targeting his comment about her size, and he accused her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom Aaron's perspective, he's saying he's not interested in a relationship. He might feel that he's being criticized for his honest opinion about his preferences. He called her an asshole for making him feel bad, which could imply he felt attacked for his personal views. However, his comment about her weight is discriminatory. Weight-based discrimination is a sensitive issue, and making judgments about someone's attractiveness based on their body size can be harmful and offensive. \n\nOn the author's side, she felt led on because their interactions were very flirty and they had a close relationship. When he rejected her, he gave a reason that was hurtful and based on her body. She called him out for it, which is a valid reaction to being judged for something like body size. Sending memes might be a form of venting her frustration, but could be seen as childish or aggressive. However, after being called fat and then being told to leave, her reaction might be justified as self-expression, especially if she felt disrespected.\n\nThe key points here are: \n\n1. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is a form of body shaming. It's okay to have preferences, but making someone feel bad about their body is not acceptable. The author had every right to be upset about that. \n\n2. The author's response of sending memes is a way to express her feelings, but it's possible that it crossed into being harassing. However, given the context of the hurtful comment she received, her reaction might be seen as a natural emotional response rather than intentional wrongdoing. \n\n3. The author was in a situation where she was led on, so her frustration is understandable. Aaron's refusal to be in a relationship while having a flirty, close friendship could be seen as leading her on, which complicates things. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is not in the wrong. Aaron made a harmful comment based on her body, which was inappropriate, and the author's reaction, while perhaps not the most mature, was a response to being hurt. The key issue here is Aaron's discriminatory remark, not her response to it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
