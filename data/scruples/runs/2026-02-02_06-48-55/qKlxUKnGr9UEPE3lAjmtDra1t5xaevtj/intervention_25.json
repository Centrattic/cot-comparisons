I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a friend named Aaron, and their relationship was very flirty, with dates and sleeping in the same bed. Then, when the author tried to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship and mentioned he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a code for fat girls. The author confronts Aaron, and Aaron admits he meant that. The author then spams him with memes, leading Aaron to block them, and he accuses the author of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. So, I need to analyze both sides. First, Aaron's comment was clearly hurtful. He led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, which could be seen as leading her on. Then, when she pushes for a relationship, he says no and makes a derogatory comment about her weight. That's pretty harsh and disrespectful. The author's reaction was to spam him with memes, which might be a bit over the top, but it's a response to being hurt and insulted. The author also confronts Aaron directly about the fat comment, which is valid. However, the author might have overreacted by spamming him, which could be seen as harassment. But given the context of being insulted, it's understandable. \n\nNow, Aaron's \"natural desires\" argument is a bit dodgy. People have preferences, but making a comment about someone's weight in a relationship context is often seen as a form of discrimination. The author was in a vulnerable position, led on, and then insulted. So, while the author's response might be a bit harsh, the initial wrong was Aaron's. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author's response was proportionate. The memes and spamming might be justified as emotional response but could be seen as crossing a line. However, considering Aaron's actions, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Hmm. I need to balance both sides. The key points: Aaron led her on and insulted her. Author confronted him, which is good, but the spamming might be excessive. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But the main issue is Aaron's behavior. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because Aaron was the one who insulted her and led her on. The author's reaction is understandable.\n"
