I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron and the author, who's a woman. They've been in a flirty, almost dating relationship, going on dates and sleeping together. Then, when the author wants to take it further, Aaron says he's not into relationships and isn't attracted to girls who don't work out. The author confronts him, he admits he meant fat girls, and she gets angry, calls him names, and spams his social media. He responds by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and says she's an asshole. The author is conflicted, feeling both bad and justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. Aaron led her on by being flirty and engaging in behaviors that resemble a relationship, which could be seen as leading her on. When she wants to take it further, he backs out and makes a comment about her body. That's pretty hurtful and objectifying. The author then responds with anger, calling him a piece of shit and spamming him with memes. But Aaron also called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she was being honest about her feelings when he rejected her, which is valid. However, her response of spamming him with memes might be seen as excessive. On the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (which implies fat girls) is clearly a derogatory statement. The author had the right to express her hurt, but perhaps her method of doing so (spamming) could be seen as harsh. However, given Aaron's insensitivity, her reaction is understandable. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is A, then she is in the wrong. If B, then not. \n\nI think the key points here are that Aaron led her on, made a derogatory comment, and then blamed her for being honest. The author's anger is a reaction to being rejected and called fat, which is a valid emotional response. However, her method of responding might be considered over the top. But given the context of being hurt and the other person's insensitivity, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. The line between justified anger and overreacting is thin here. The question is about whether she's the asshole. If the author's actions were a proportionate response to being mistreated, then she's not in the wrong. But if her response was unnecessarily harsh, then she might be. However, considering Aaron's comment was a direct insult, her response is understandable. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
