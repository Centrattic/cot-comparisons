I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who told the author he would be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him, and things escalate with some harsh messages.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron had a flirty, almost dating relationship. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron said he's not into relationships and specifically mentioned being attracted to girls who work out. The author perceives this as a comment on her weight. She responds angrily, calls him a piece of shit, and then spams him with memes. He blocks her, saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but thinks she might be in the wrong.\n\nNow, to evaluate. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for her reaction. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a veiled insult about her weight, which is hurtful. The author's anger and subsequent messages might be a justified response to feeling disrespected and led on. On the other hand, the author's reaction was to spam him with memes and harsh messages, which could be considered aggressive or retaliatory. Also, Aaron might feel defensive about his personal preferences, even if they're problematic.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: 1) Did Aaron cross a line by leading her on and then making a comment about her weight? 2) Did the author overreact in her response?\n\nIf Aaron genuinely meant to hurt her feelings by setting her up with false expectations and then making a comment about her body, then the author's anger is understandable. However, her response of spamming him with memes and harsh messages is not a mature or constructive way to handle the situation. It's possible that while Aaron was in the wrong for his comment, the author's reaction also wasn't appropriate. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's okay to express hurt and frustration, attacking someone publicly (even if it's through social media) and using harsh language can be seen as the wrong approach. The author could have addressed her feelings without escalating the conflict. However, Aaron's comment about body size is problematic, and the author's reaction is a response to feeling objectified or discriminated against, which complicates things.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, maybe neither is entirely in the wrong, but the author's actions do cross into being the asshole by continuing to attack after Aaron has already blocked her. The initial response of expressing hurt is okay, but the persistent spamming and harsh language after being cut off might make her the asshole. Alternatively, if Aaron's comment was a deal-breaker, her response is justified. But given that he had already ended the conversation by blocking her, her continued attacks are worse.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while Aaron's comment is problematic, the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily, especially after he had already removed himself from the conversation.\n"
