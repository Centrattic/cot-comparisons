I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who's been leading the author on, being flirty, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author wants to take it to the next level, Aaron says he's not into a relationship and basically says it's because she's fat, using \"doesn't work out\" as a code for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong for reacting the way she did. She called him out for being attracted to girls who work out, which she interpreted as fat-shaming. She told him he was a piece of shit and started spamming him with memes related to body positivity. He then blocked her and called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron was leading her on, then rejected her and made a fat-shaming comment. She confronted him and expressed her hurt feelings, then continued to message him with memes. He felt she was attacking his personal preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, being called fat and rejected based on body image is hurtful. The author's reaction was emotional and defensive, but is that justified? She was hurt and tried to stand up for herself. On the other hand, spamming him with memes might be seen as passive-aggressive or harassing. However, given that he had led her on and then insulted her, her response could be seen as a reaction to being wronged.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if Aaron was indeed fat-shaming her under the guise of \"not working out,\" then the author was right to call him out. However, her method of confronting him might have been a bit aggressive, but given the emotional context, it's understandable. The question is whether her actions were wrong. If he was in the wrong for rejecting her based on her body, then she's justified in her anger. But if her response was overly harsh, maybe she's part to blame. However, the main issue is his fat-shaming. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because he was the one who led her on and then insulted her. Her reaction, while maybe not the most mature, is a response to being mistreated. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
