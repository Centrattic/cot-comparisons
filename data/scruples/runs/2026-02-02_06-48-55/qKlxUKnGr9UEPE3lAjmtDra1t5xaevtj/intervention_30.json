I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after reacting to Aaron's comments. \n\nFirst, Aaron told the author he considered her his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interpreted as a code for fat girls. The author felt led on and then confronted him. When Aaron mentioned his attraction to working out as a requirement, she got angry and accused him of being a \"piece of shit.\" Then she spammed him with memes about body size, leading to him blocking her and calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as making a judgment based on body image, which is a sensitive topic. The author felt led on, which is a valid feeling when someone gives mixed signals. Her reaction, while harsh, might be an emotional response to feeling rejected and insulted. However, her actions of spamming him with memes and calling him a \"piece of shit\" could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful, even if she was hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's statement about his attraction preferences is a personal opinion, though it's problematic to make assumptions about someone's attractiveness based on their fitness. The author's reaction might be justified if she felt disrespected, but her method of retaliation by spamming and using harsh language could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. While Aaron's comment was hurtful and perhaps insensitive, the author's response was confrontational and public, which could be seen as shaming him. However, the situation is complex because Aaron may have led her on by engaging in flirty behavior and then giving her the brush-off. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some accountability. Aaron's comment was inappropriate, and the author's reaction, while emotional, was in response to feeling disrespected. However, her actions of spamming and harsh language might make her partially at fault. But given the context of being led on and then rejected with a comment that implies body-shaming, the author's response is more about defending herself. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong entirely.\n"
