I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who the author is in a flirty, date-like relationship with. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron said he's not interested, then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. After a confrontation, the author called Aaron out, sent memes, and Aaron responded by saying the author made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author felt led on by Aaron, who was being flirty and going on dates but then pulled back when pressed. The comment about working out is a sensitive one, as it's often used to imply body size. The author confronted Aaron directly, which led to an argument. Now, the author is being accused of making Aaron feel bad, but the author feels justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a subtle way of expressing bias against people based on their body size, which is a form of body shaming. The author was right to point that out and express their feelings. However, the author's response of spamming Aaron with memes and calling him a piece of shit crossed into aggressive behavior. While it's understandable to feel hurt and want to confront someone, the method used here was harsh and possibly unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's initial actions of leading the author on and then making a derogatory comment about their body are equally, if not more, wrong. The author had the right to be upset and set boundaries. However, the way the author responded (spamming and using harsh language) could be seen as overreacting, even if the underlying issue is valid. \n\nBut the core issue here is Aaron's body shaming. The author's anger is justified in that context. The question is whether their response made them the asshole. While the author's method of confronting Aaron was aggressive, the initial wrongdoing lies with Aaron. The author was defending themselves against a harmful comment and the emotional manipulation of being led on. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, the person who makes hurtful comments and then gets defensive often gets the short end of the stick. The author's actions, while not perfect, were a reaction to being mistreated. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
