I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who led the author on, making it seem like they were more than friends with flirtatious behavior and dates. Then, when the author wants to take things further, Aaron backs out and says he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a fat-shaming comment.\n\nFirst, the context is important. Aaron has been acting in a way that's more than just friendship, so the author likely felt there was a mutual interest or at least a possibility of a relationship. When Aaron pulls back and gives a comment that seems to target the author's weight, that's where the conflict arises. The author calls him out, which seems justified because the comment is hurtful and discriminatory. Then, the author expresses their frustration through memes and messages, which might be seen as harsh, but the context of being led on and then rejected with a prejudiced remark could make their reaction understandable.\n\nThe key points are: Aaron led on, made a fat-shaming comment, and the author called him out. The question is whether the author's response was wrong. While spamming messages might be excessive, the underlying issue is Aaron's behavior and comment. The author's anger and hurt come from being manipulated and then criticized for body-shaming. It's possible that the author isn't entirely wrong because they were mistreated first. However, their method of retaliation might be questionable. But considering the circumstances, the author's reaction is a response to being led on and then fat-shamed, so maybe they're not the asshole here. The answer might be B (No), but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
