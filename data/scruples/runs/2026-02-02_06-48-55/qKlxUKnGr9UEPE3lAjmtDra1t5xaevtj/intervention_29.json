I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who had a flirty, almost romantic relationship with the author. They went on dates, slept together, etc. Then, when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he wasn't into relationships and specifically mentioned he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, he admitted it was about her weight, and she called him out and then spammed him with memes. He then labeled her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, implying a romantic interest. When the author wanted to take it to the next level, he rejected her but gave a comment about her weight. That's a clear case of using a physical attribute as a reason for rejection, which is pretty hurtful. The author then confronted him and expressed her anger through memes. He then accused her of making him feel bad for his natural desires.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a derogatory remark about the author's weight. That's a form of body shaming. The author's reaction was to confront him and express her hurt, which is a legitimate response. She also sent memes that were related to the issue, which might be seen as passive-aggressive, but in the context of being wronged, it's understandable. However, spamming him repeatedly could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's a reaction to being hurt. \n\nBut the main issue is Aaron's behavior. He led her on with ambiguous signals, then rejected her with a comment that's a form of discrimination based on weight. He then accused her of being an asshole for calling him out on it. In that case, the wrong is on Aaron's side for the initial manipulation and the hurtful comment. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most mature, is a response to being wronged. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
