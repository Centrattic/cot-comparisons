I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after a situation with their friend Aaron.\n\nSo, the background is that the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship. They go on dates and sleep together. The author felt like Aaron was leading them on. Then, when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't interested because the author doesn't work out, implying they're fat. The author confronted him, and Aaron confirmed it was about weight. The author reacted by calling him out and spamming his social media with memes about size, which led Aaron to block them and say the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFirst, Aaron made a comment that was clearly hurtful, using \"not into girls who don't work out\" as a code for fat girls. That's a clear case of fatphobia. The author was right to confront him because that kind of comment is discriminatory and harmful. People shouldn't be judged based on their weight, and Aaron's excuse for not wanting to be in a relationship is based on a harmful stereotype.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to spam Aaron with memes. While the intent might have been to call out his behavior, spamming someone's social media, even in anger, can be seen as aggressive. The author might have overstepped by continuing to contact him after he had already left, which could be considered harassment. So, while the initial confrontation was justified, the follow-up actions might be questionable.\n\nBut then again, Aaron had just hurt the author's feelings by rejecting them based on their weight. The author was in emotional pain, which is a valid reason to react strongly. The memes used are about body positivity, which is a legitimate response to fatphobia. However, the method of delivering them\u2014spamming\u2014might be where the author went wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: Aaron's fatphobic comment is the root issue. The author was right to point that out. But the way they did it (spamming) might be seen as too harsh. However, the author was hurt and trying to stand up for themselves. The question is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given the situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to express their hurt and call out Aaron's behavior, which is understandable. But the method might have been excessive. On the other hand, Aaron's comment was clearly harmful, and the author's response, while maybe too aggressive, was a reaction to being mistreated.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't entirely wrong. They were right to address Aaron's fatphobia, which is a major issue. However, the way they continued to contact Aaron after he left could be seen as overreaching. But given the context of being rejected due to fatphobia, the author's actions might be more justified than not. The community often sides with people who stand up against discrimination, even if their methods are a bit harsh.\n\nSo, probably answer B (Not the Asshole), because the author was addressing a harmful comment, even if the method was questionable. The main issue was Aaron's fatphobia, and the author had the right to call him out.\n"
