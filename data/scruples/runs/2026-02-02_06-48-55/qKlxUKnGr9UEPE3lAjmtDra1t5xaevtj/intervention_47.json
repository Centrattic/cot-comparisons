I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where Aaron told her she was his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he wasn't into girls who don't work out, which she interpreted as a comment on her weight. She confronted him, and there was a back-and-forth that led to her blocking him and spamming his Facebook. Aaron claimed she was making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and she's conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron's comments about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a fat-shaming remark. Making someone feel bad about their weight is generally considered hurtful and offensive. The author was in a situation where she felt led on, and when confronted, Aaron didn't take responsibility but instead blamed her for his desires. That might justify her reaction.\n\nHowever, the author did spam his Facebook with memes that could be considered aggressive or mean. While she was hurt and angry, using memes to attack him might be seen as crossing a line, even if she felt justified. The key here is whether her actions were proportionate to the situation. If Aaron made a derogatory comment, she has every right to be upset, but responding with spam might not be the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's initial behavior was leading her on, which is also problematic. He didn't communicate his feelings clearly, leading to the emotional distress. The author's anger and feeling of betrayal are valid. However, her method of expressing that anger by spamming with memes might be seen as aggressive and unkind, even if she felt wronged. \n\nSo, the main conflict is between Aaron's fat-shaming comment and the author's response. While Aaron is clearly in the wrong for the comment, the author's actions of spamming with offensive memes might also be considered unkind, even if she felt justified. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer isn't straightforward.\n\nBut considering the situation, Aaron's fat-shaming is the root issue. The author's response was a reaction to being hurt. While her method could be better, the core issue lies with Aaron. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was responding to being made to feel bad. However, her actions might not be the best approach. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is about the author's actions, then maybe she is partially wrong for the spamming, but the main issue is Aaron. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the actions described.\n\nIn many similar situations, if someone says something offensive and the other person reacts, it's often the initial comment that's the problem. So despite her response being aggressive, the main fault is Aaron's. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B for No.\n"
