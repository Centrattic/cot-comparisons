I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Aaron, who the author is in a flirty, almost dating relationship with. The key issue is when Aaron says the author is his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then adds that he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. After the author pushes for a relationship, Aaron backs off and says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out. The author confronts him, and he confirms it's about her weight. The author then calls him out and spams him with memes. He blocks her and says she made him feel like a bad person for his preferences.\n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior: He's leading her on with flirty behavior, sleepovers, etc., which suggests he's interested. But when she wants to take it further, he backs off and uses her weight as a reason. That's a problem because he's being inconsiderate and maybe even cruel. His comment about not being into girls who don't work out is a backhanded way of rejecting her based on her body, which is hurtful.\n\nThe author's response: She calls him out for making her feel bad and uses memes to express her hurt. She confronts him, which is reasonable given the context. He then blocks her and accuses her of making him feel like a bad person for his \"natural desires.\" His reaction seems defensive and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe user is torn but thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. The author is reacting to being rejected based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. Aaron's comments are problematic because they're a form of body-shaming and using a justification that's not valid. The author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to being insulted. However, spamming him with memes after he's blocked her might be excessive. \n\nBut considering the context, Aaron led her on and then used her weight as a reason to back out. The author is standing up for herself, which is understandable. The question is whether she overreacted. She called him out for his words, which were hurtful. His response that she's making him feel bad for his natural desires is more about defending his bias rather than taking responsibility. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the key is intent and impact. Aaron's comment was a direct insult, leading to her reaction. While her spamming might be a bit much, his initial behavior was more harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against body-shaming. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
