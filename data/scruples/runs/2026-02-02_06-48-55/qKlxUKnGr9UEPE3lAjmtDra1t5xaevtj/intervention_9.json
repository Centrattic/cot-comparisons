I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is friends with Aaron, and they have a somewhat flirtatious relationship, going on dates and sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were close to starting a relationship. Then, Aaron told her he wasn't interested in a relationship and made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a coded way of saying he doesn't like fat girls. The author confronted him, and he admitted he meant that. She got upset, called him a \"piece of shit,\" and then spammed him with memes about body size. He blocked her and said she was making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" She's conflicted between feeling bad and thinking she did the right thing.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is clearly a problem. It's a negative comment about her body and implies that he looks down on people based on weight. That's unfair and hurtful. The author was within her rights to express her hurt and anger. \n\nHowever, her response was to spam him with memes, which can be seen as aggressive or harassing. While she was upset, using social media to send memes repeatedly might be crossing a line, even if it's about body shaming. Also, she called him derogatory names, which isn't ideal, though it's a common reaction when someone is insulted.\n\nOn Aaron's side, his comment was clearly body-shaming and discriminatory. He should have been more considerate and not made such a remark, especially in a situation where the author felt they were close. But when he was confronted, he responded by saying she was making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" which seems dismissive and invalidating of her feelings. He also blocked her after she expressed her anger, which could be seen as avoiding responsibility.\n\nThe author's actions, while hurtful in delivery, were a reaction to being body-shamed. She had the right to be upset, but her method of expressing it might have been excessive. However, considering the context, maybe her emotional response is understandable. The key points are whether his comment was wrong and if her response was proportionate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person who was wronged is not considered the asshole even if their response was harsh. So here, Aaron was the one who made the hurtful comment, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Her response might not be perfect, but the root cause was his discriminatory remark. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not the asshole).\n"
