I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who told the author he considered her his ideal girlfriend but then excluded her based on her not working out, implying she's fat. The author confronted him, he admitted he didn't find her attractive because of her size, and they had a confrontation where the author sent memes and Aaron called her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron's behavior seems problematic. He was in a flirty, dating-like relationship with the author and then rejected her based on body size, which is a superficial and discriminatory reason. Leading someone on with flirty behavior and then using such a justification could be seen as cruel.\n\nThe author's response was to send memes that are critical of his behavior. She called him a piece of shit and continued contacting him after he left. While her actions might be seen as harsh, it's important to note that she was responding to rejection based on her appearance, which can be hurtful. Her reaction could be a mix of anger and hurt, and using memes to express her feelings isn't uncommon. However, spamming someone with messages after they've asked to stop might be considered over the top, even if she's upset.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's justification for not wanting to be in a relationship is based on his personal preferences, but he was in a situation where he was leading her on. His response of calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires\" is also problematic because it shifts the blame onto her for his own prejudiced views. That's a classic deflection.\n\nThe author felt misled and used, given the flirty behavior and dates. Her right to express her anger is valid, especially if Aaron's comments were hurtful. However, the method of expressing that anger\u2014spamming him with memes\u2014might be seen as aggressive. But considering the context of being rejected for superficial reasons, her reaction could be seen as a justified emotional response rather than something malicious.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the main issue is Aaron's behavior. He led her on and then used a discriminatory reason to reject her. The author's response, while perhaps a bit aggressive, is a reaction to his insensitivity. The question is whether her actions make her the asshole. Since Aaron was in the wrong to begin with, the author isn't entirely to blame. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
