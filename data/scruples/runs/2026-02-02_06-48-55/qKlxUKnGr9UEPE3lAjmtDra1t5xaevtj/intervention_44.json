I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he considered her his ideal girlfriend but then said he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interpreted as a comment on her weight. She reacted by calling him a piece of shit and spamming his social media with memes. Aaron then called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron had a close, flirty relationship with dates and sleeping in the same bed. The author felt Aaron was leading her on. When she wanted to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't into relationships and mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out. She took offense, confronted him, and then spammed him with memes. He then called her out for making him feel bad, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, Aaron's comment about girls who don't work out could be seen as a polite way of saying he's not into plus-size women, which might be fat-shaming. On the other hand, the author called him names and spammed him, which could be considered aggressive and hurtful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Did Aaron have the right to express his preferences, even if they might be problematic? People do have personal preferences in partners, but if his comment was a way to reject her while making it seem like her issue, that's a problem. The author's response was to insult and spam him, which is hurtful, but she might feel justified given the rejection based on her weight.\n\nIs it about who started it? Aaron made a comment that hurt her feelings, so she retaliated. But her response was to attack him publicly, which could be seen as the wrong move. However, if he was being insincere (saying she's his ideal but then saying he doesn't like her body type), that's leading her on, and she might be reacting to that manipulation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her response was proportionate. Calling someone a \"piece of shit\" and spamming social media is harsh, but maybe she felt wronged. On the flip side, Aaron's comment was hurtful, so she might have felt justified. The key is if her actions crossed a line, which they did (spamming, name-calling), but her feelings are valid if he was leading her on. So maybe it's a mix, but the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she took things further by attacking him publicly, even if she was hurt, that's likely the part where she's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
