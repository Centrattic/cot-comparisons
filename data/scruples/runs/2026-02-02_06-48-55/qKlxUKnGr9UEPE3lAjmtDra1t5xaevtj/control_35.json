I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author had a close relationship with Aaron that was very flirty and included dates and sleeping in the same bed. When the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't interested in a relationship. The key point is Aaron's comment that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, and after a back-and-forth, they both exchange harsh words.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Aaron led the author on with flirty behavior, which could suggest he gave mixed signals or wasn't clear about his intentions. When the author wants a serious relationship, he backs away and gives a reason that seems like a personal attack on the author's body. The author then calls him out, which leads to arguments. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions include calling Aaron out for implying he's not attracted to her because of her weight, and responding with memes that mock his comment. Aaron claims she's making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" \n\nIn relationships, honesty and respect are important. If Aaron was being insincere or leading the author on, he's at fault. However, the author's response was to spam him with memes and call him a name. Even though she was hurt, her reaction might have been harsh. But considering Aaron's comment about her weight, which is a sensitive and potentially hurtful remark, the author's response could be seen as understandable anger. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she was justified in feeling hurt and called him out, but the way she did it (spamming him with memes) might be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, if Aaron's comment was indeed a direct insult about her weight, then her response is a valid reaction to a hurtful statement. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. She was defending herself against a personal attack, but using memes and spam might not be the best approach. However, given that Aaron made a comment about her body, which is a serious issue, her anger is justified. The answer might hinge on whether her response was proportionate. \n\nIn conclusion, considering that Aaron made a hurtful comment about her weight and the author was standing up for herself, even if her method was unorthodox, she might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
