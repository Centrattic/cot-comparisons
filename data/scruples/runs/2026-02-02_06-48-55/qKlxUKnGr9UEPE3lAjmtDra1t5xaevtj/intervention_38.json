I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The situation is about a friend, Aaron, who told the author he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author then responds with anger, calls him a piece of shit, and spams him with memes. Aaron says she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron have been in a flirty friendship, going on dates, sleeping together. The author wanted to take it to the next level, but Aaron said he's not into a relationship. The problem arises when he says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a fat-shaming comment. She responds by being confrontational and spamming him with memes. Aaron claims she's making him feel bad for his natural desires, and the author is conflicted about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron made a comment that the author perceived as fat-shaming. That's a red flag because it's not okay to make someone feel bad about their body. However, the author's response was to lash out, call him a piece of shit, and spam him with memes. The memes might be meant as a form of retaliation, but it's possible that her response was also harsh. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, Aaron's comment was inappropriate and could be seen as discriminatory. People shouldn't make judgments based on weight or fitness. On the other hand, the author's reaction was to be confrontational and aggressive. While her feelings were hurt, the way she responded could be seen as unkind or even harassing, especially with the spamming. \n\nThe author's half-feeling bad suggests she recognizes her actions might not be justified. But does that mean she's at fault? The situation is tricky because both parties have some issues. However, the initial wrong might be Aaron's for making the discriminatory comment. The author's reaction, while maybe not the best, is a response to being hurt. But if her response crossed a line (like spamming), that could be her fault. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, fat-shaming is generally considered unacceptable, so Aaron's comment is problematic. However, the author's response might be seen as a justified reaction to being disrespected. But spamming with memes could be seen as unprofessional or cruel. \n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe she isn't, considering the initial comment from Aaron. However, her response might be unkind. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer could hinge on whether the author's actions were proportionate to the hurt she felt. If the memes were meant to mock Aaron for his comment, maybe that's okay, but spamming could be excessive. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was in a situation where she felt led on, then her frustration is understandable. But the way she expressed that might be over the top. \n\nI think the key here is that Aaron made a hurtful comment, which he shouldn't have. The author's response was to be angry and confrontational, which is natural, but the follow-up with spamming might be where she's in the wrong. However, if the memes are a form of expressing her feelings, it's more about intent. \n\nGiven all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because Aaron's comment was the initial problem. But the spamming part might be crossing a line. However, since the question is whether she is in the wrong, and considering that she was reacting to being fat-shamed, maybe she isn't. Alternatively, the answer could be that she's in the wrong for overreacting. \n\nBut the community's take on \"Am I the Asshole\" usually looks at who has the bigger transgression. If Aaron made the hurtful comment, he's the asshole. The author's reaction, while maybe not perfect, is a response. So maybe she's not the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
