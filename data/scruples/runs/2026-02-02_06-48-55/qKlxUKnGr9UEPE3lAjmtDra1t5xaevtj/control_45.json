I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong based on the given scenario. The main issue seems to be about a friend, Aaron, who made a comment about the author's body type after expressing initial interest. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and Aaron had a flirty, semi-dating relationship. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron declined, using the excuse that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author then publicly shamed him on social media, leading to Aaron calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent, honesty, and respect. When someone says they're not attracted to someone else based on their body type, that's a personal preference, but it's also a form of rejection. The author felt led on because their relationship had elements of a romantic one. In relationships, even if they're not fully defined, there's an expectation of honesty. However, Aaron's comment about not being attracted due to weight is a personal opinion, albeit hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction involved spamming Aaron's Facebook with memes that criticize body-shaming. This public shaming could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful. Even if Aaron made a hurtful comment, responding with public mockery might escalate the situation and could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and leading someone on. If Aaron was giving mixed signals by engaging in flirty behavior and dates but then rejecting her for his personal preferences, he might share some responsibility. However, the author's reaction of public shaming and using aggressive memes might be considered in the wrong because it's a form of harassment, even if motivated by hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response was justified. While Aaron's comment was hurtful and the author was rejected, the method of response (spamming social media) is problematic. Public shaming can be harmful and isn't a respectful way to address the issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if Aaron's words were hurtful. However, some might argue that the author had the right to express their anger, especially after feeling led on.\n\nBut in terms of societal norms and what's considered acceptable behavior, the public humiliation and spamming are generally seen as inappropriate, regardless of the provocation. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for their response, even if there were valid reasons for being upset.\n"
