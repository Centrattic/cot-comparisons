I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend, Aaron, made a conflicting statement. He told the author he'd be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. They had a flirty, date-like relationship, and when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he wasn't interested because of her weight. The author then responded with angry messages and memes, leading Aaron to block her and call her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, we need to assess the situation from both sides. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a body-shaming remark. The author took it seriously when she asked if he meant she was fat and he confirmed it. That's hurtful and disrespectful. However, the author's reaction involved spamming him with memes and insults, which could be seen as aggressive. \n\nBut considering the context, Aaron led her on by maintaining a flirty, physical relationship while not being honest about his feelings. When the author confronted him, he gave a superficial reason for not wanting to pursue a relationship, which is problematic. His comment about her weight is discriminatory. The author's anger is a valid response to being treated poorly and having her feelings dismissed. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. While her response was harsh, it was in reaction to being body-shamed and led on. Aaron's actions were inconsiderate, and the author has the right to express her hurt. However, attacking him with spam messages might not be the most constructive way to handle it. That said, given the emotional context, her actions are understandable, even if not ideal. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since Aaron made the offensive comment first and the author's actions were a reaction to being mistreated, the primary fault lies with Aaron. The author's response, while perhaps excessive, is a result of being wronged. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
