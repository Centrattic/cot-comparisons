I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy named Aaron and the author's friend. They had a relationship that was more than friends, with flirtatious behavior and dates. The friend told the author he considers her his \"ideal girlfriend,\" but then said he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron led the author on by acting flirty and having dates, which gave her the impression they were more than just friends. Then, when the author pushes for a relationship, he backs out and gives a reason that's clearly about her weight. The author confronts him and yells, leading to him blocking her.\n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior was definitely leading her on. If he wasn't interested in a relationship, he should have been clear from the start. But when he finally breaks it off, he uses a comment about her weight, which is pretty offensive and could be seen as body-shaming. The author's reaction is to call him out and send memes related to her weight, which might be a bit aggressive, but given the context of being led on and then insulted, it's understandable.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If Aaron was being insincere and led her on, the author isn't at fault for feeling hurt and reacting emotionally. However, the way she responded (spamming with memes) might be seen as harsh. But considering the hurtful words Aaron used, her reaction is a justified emotional response. \n\nThe other person, Aaron, is the one who made the derogatory comment, and he's the one who ended up blocking her. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself, even if her method of doing so was a bit extreme. So the answer would be B, the author is not the asshole. The main issue is Aaron's insincerity and body-shaming comment, not her reaction to it.\n"
