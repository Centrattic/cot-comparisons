I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after a situation where their friend (Aaron) made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a fat-shaming remark. The author then reacted strongly by calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes, leading to Aaron feeling attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The author claims that Aaron led them on by being flirty and engaging in date-like activities, which could be seen as creating expectations of a romantic relationship. However, when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron rejected them, citing attraction issues related to the author's fitness. The author then expressed their hurt feelings and confronted Aaron, who dismissed their feelings and called them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author overreacted. On one hand, being fat-shamed is a serious issue, and the author has a right to be upset. The comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment based on appearance, which is hurtful. The author's reaction, while strong, could be justified as a defense of their self-worth and a response to being disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of responding\u2014spamming Aaron with memes\u2014might be seen as aggressive and potentially hurtful. However, in context, the memes were about body positivity and could be a way to assert their stance against fat-shaming. The author also confronted Aaron directly and expressed their feelings, which is a valid emotional response to being insulted.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's actions stem from being hurt by a comment that targets their body, which is a valid and sensitive issue. While the reaction could be seen as harsh, the underlying issue of fat-shaming is problematic. The author is not wrong for standing up for themselves in this context. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
