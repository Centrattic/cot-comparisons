I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and Aaron have been friends for a few months, with some flirtatious behavior and even sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were more than friends. Then, during a conversation, Aaron says he's not interested in a relationship and implies that the author is fat, using \"girls who don't work out\" as a code. The author confronts him, and he admits it's about her weight. The author gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and starts spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron says she made him feel like a bad person for his preferences, and the author feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, Aaron's comments are clearly hurtful. He dismissed the author's feelings and used a backhanded compliment to hurt her. That's not okay. He's being rude and judgmental about her body, which is a sensitive topic. His actions led to the conflict, so he's at fault for being dismissive and making a derogatory comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to spam him with memes. While it's understandable she's upset, spamming someone after an argument, especially on social media, can be considered aggressive or harassment. However, considering the context, she was reacting to being hurt and dismissed. The memes might be a form of expressing her frustration, but the method (spamming) could be seen as excessive. Still, the root cause is Aaron's behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. She did confront him and express her feelings, which is valid. The spamming might be a bit much, but given the emotional context, it's a common way people vent. However, the key here is that Aaron's actions were the primary issue. The author's response, while maybe not the best, is a reaction to being hurt. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but the analysis suggests that Aaron is the one at fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B for No.\n"
