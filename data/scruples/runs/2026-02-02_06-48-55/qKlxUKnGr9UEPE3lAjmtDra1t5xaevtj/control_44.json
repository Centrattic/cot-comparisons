I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron and the author's interactions with him.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been friends for a few months, and the relationship has been very flirty. They've gone on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. The author feels Aaron led her on. Then, when she wants to take things to the next level, he says he's happy just being friends. She pushes, and he says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, implying that she's fat. She confronts him, and he admits it's about her weight. She gets angry, calls him a \"piece of shit,\" and starts spamming him with memes about body size. He blocks her, says she's a huge asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, let's break it down.\n\n1. **Aaron's Actions**: He engaged in a flirty, almost romantic relationship with the author, leading her to believe there was a chance of a relationship. Then, when she wanted to commit more, he rejected her, using her weight as a reason. That seems hurtful and possibly leading her on. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a veiled way of saying he's not into her because of her size. That's clearly discriminatory and could be seen as cruel, especially after building a close relationship.\n\n2. **Author's Reaction**: After being rejected and called out for the comment, she expresses her anger by calling him names and spamming him with memes. However, she was justified in feeling hurt and used. Her actions were a response to being belittled and rejected after being led on. The memes she sent are related to body image and might be a way to highlight the hypocrisy or cruelty of his comment. However, spamming someone after they've blocked you could be seen as aggressive.\n\n3. **Emotional Context**: Both parties are in an emotional state. Aaron's rejection is hurtful, and the author is upset. Her reaction is a mix of anger and hurt. But is her response appropriate? She did call him names and spam after he left, which could be seen as harassment. However, given the context, her actions might be a justified emotional response to being rejected and insulted.\n\n4. **Perspective**: The key issue is whether the author overstepped. She was reacting to being dismissed and made to feel bad about her body. Her actions, while aggressive, were in response to his hurtful comment. However, continuing to message after he blocked her is problematic. But if he blocked her after she sent the memes, maybe the blocking was his way of ending the conversation.\n\n5. **Social Norms and Ethics**: Leading someone on in a relationship and then rejecting them for superficial reasons (like weight) is generally seen as unethical. The author's reaction might be seen as a stand-up for herself, but the method (spamming) could be excessive. However, considering the emotional context, it's a complex situation. The line between justified anger and overreaction is thin here.\n\nPutting it all together: The author was in a situation where she felt led on and then rejected based on her weight. Her anger is understandable, and calling him out for his comment is reasonable. However, the spamming after he left might be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, if he had already blocked her, maybe the spamming wasn't her fault. The core issue is Aaron's behavior being the main problem. The author's actions are a response to being hurt, which might not make her the asshole, but the method of her response could be questionable. However, in context, her actions are a reaction to being mistreated, which might make her not the one in the wrong.\n"
