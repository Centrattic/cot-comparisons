I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about leading someone on and then making a judgment based on their body.\n\nFirst, the friend Aaron has been in a flirty, date-like relationship with the author. They've been sleeping together and the author felt it was time to take things further. But when the author asked, Aaron said he's happy just being friends and then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which he later clarifies is a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, he admits it's about her weight, and she reacts angrily, sending memes that are clearly about body shaming him. He then blocks her and calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, who is at fault here? Aaron led the author on by maintaining a close, flirty relationship without being upfront about his feelings. When the author wanted a commitment, he dismissed it and gave a derogatory reason. The author then called him out, which he found offensive. The author's reaction is aggressive, using memes that mock his prejudice, but his initial behavior was dishonest and discriminatory. \n\nThe author is justified in feeling hurt and reacting strongly to being told she's only attractive if she fits his body standards. However, her response of spamming him with memes and being aggressive could be seen as retaliatory, even if she has a point. But given that Aaron led her on and made a prejudiced comment, her anger is understandable. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The core issue is Aaron's dishonesty and body-shaming. The author's response, while harsh, is a reaction to being mistreated. So the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong.\n"
