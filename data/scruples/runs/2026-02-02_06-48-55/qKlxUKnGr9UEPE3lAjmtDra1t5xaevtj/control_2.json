I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after an argument with their friend Aaron. The situation involves Aaron making a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then responds by calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and sending memes from bloggers related to size issues. Aaron later says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron initially led the author on with flirtatious behavior and dates, which could be seen as leading them on. When the author wants to take things further, Aaron pulls back and makes a comment that's clearly a put-down. The author confronts him, and he admits it's about her weight. That's pretty direct and could be hurtful. \n\nThe author's response is to lash out, call him names, and spam him with memes. While the initial comment from Aaron was inappropriate and hurtful, the author's reaction might be seen as aggressive. However, considering the context of being led on and then being rejected with a comment about her body, her frustration is understandable. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If someone makes a derogatory comment, the person being targeted has the right to express their hurt and anger. Sending memes could be seen as a form of retaliation, but it's also a way of asserting oneself. However, spamming someone with messages after being hurt might cross into being confrontational or harassing. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is a problematic and potentially fat-shaming statement. The author is justified in feeling disrespected and hurt. The fact that Aaron called her an \"asshole\" for confronting him suggests that he's defending a prejudice, which is not acceptable. \n\nSo, while both parties have their issues\u2014Aaron for leading her on and making a derogatory comment, and the author for her aggressive response\u2014the core issue is Aaron's fat-shaming. The author's reaction, though maybe overly aggressive, stems from being wronged. The question is whether her actions make her the asshole. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial wrongdoing was Aaron's for making the comment and leading her on. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to that. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she was the one who was mistreated, her response is a reaction to that. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, but some might argue she overreacted. But given the context, her response is understandable. So the answer is B (No).\n"
