I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their interaction with Aaron. \n\nFirst, the background: The author and Aaron had a flirty, quasi-dating relationship. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron said he wanted to stay friends. When pressed, he mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a comment on her weight. She called him out and was upset, then messaged him with memes about body size. He responded by calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It implies a bias based on body size, which can be a form of fatphobia. The author rightly called him out for using his preferences as an excuse to reject her after leading her on. Leading someone on by being flirty and having a close relationship, then using a vague excuse to reject them is not fair. \n\nThe author's response, while perhaps harsh in tone, was a reaction to being hurt and dismissed. Using memes to express her feelings might come across as aggressive, but given the context, it's a response to being made to feel bad about her body. Aaron's \"natural desires\" argument is a way to deflect his own insensitivity and double standards. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nSo, the key points are: Aaron led her on, made a fatphobic comment, and tried to justify it. The author reacted to being rejected and called out his behavior. Her actions were a defense against being devalued, not the initial wrongdoing. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
