I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a friend named Aaron who told the author he would be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a code for fat girls. The author then reacted strongly by calling Aaron a piece of shit and spamming his Facebook with memes. Aaron said she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is now conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a fat-shaming remark. That's pretty hurtful, especially given their close relationship. The author might feel led on, which is understandable because they thought they were in a more serious relationship. Reacting emotionally by calling him names and spamming social media is a strong response, but is it wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron might feel that his honest opinion about his preferences is his natural desire, and the author is attacking him for that. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Was Aaron's comment about working out a legitimate preference or a veiled insult? If it's the latter, the author has every right to be upset. However, responding by spamming and being aggressive could come across as hostile, even if justified by Aaron's behavior.\n\nThe author did confront Aaron directly and ask if he meant that she's fat, and he confirmed it. That's a clear admission. So the author's anger is valid because Aaron was being cruel. But the way she handled it\u2014calling him names and spamming\u2014might not be the best approach. However, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if Aaron was indeed being fat-shaming, the author isn't at fault for standing up for herself. The question is about whether the author is the asshole. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response was proportionate. If Aaron's actions were hurtful, her reaction is a form of self-defense. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a gray area. Maybe the author should have tried to resolve it more calmly. But given the context of being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming comment, her reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Let me think again. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B. Because Aaron's comment was unkind, and the author was defending herself. Even if her response was harsh, the root cause was Aaron's behavior. So the author isn't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
