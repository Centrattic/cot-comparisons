I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong after a situation involving a friend named Aaron. The key points here are the interactions between them and the comments made.\n\nFirst, the background: They had a relationship that was more than friends, with flirty behaviors and even sleeping together. The author felt Aaron was leading her on. Then, after a conversation where Aaron says he's not into a relationship and comments about her not working out (implying she might be fat), the author responds by calling him names and sending memes. Aaron then blocks her and accuses her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nLooking at Aaron's part: He told her he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. That seems like a judgmental statement, which can be hurtful. The author's reaction includes sending memes that are critical of him, which might be seen as harassment or continued conflict after he's already blocked her. But Aaron also made a comment that could be considered body-shaming, which is definitely inappropriate.\n\nThe author's actions: She sent memes and spam after he blocked her. This could be seen as crossing a line, especially after he's already ended the interaction. However, his initial comment about her body was the catalyst. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with spam might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She did make him feel bad, but he first made her feel bad with his comment. The key is whether her response was justified. If she was retaliating in a way that's also hurtful, then maybe both have issues. However, the question is about the author specifically. She called him names and sent memes, which could be seen as aggressive. But considering his initial comment was a form of body-shaming, her reaction might be a defensive response. However, sending spam after he blocked her could be excessive. \n\nIn terms of who started it, Aaron made the hurtful comment. The author's response, while understandable, might not be the most mature way to handle it. So, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because she was reacting to a hurtful comment, but her actions (spamming, calling names) could still be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific context. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer could be a mix. But the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many cases, if someone is being body-shamed, the person being shamed isn't the one at fault. However, the author's response might be seen as equally unkind. So maybe both are at fault to some extent. But since the question is about the author specifically, if her actions were a direct response to his comment, perhaps she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, her continued harassment after he blocked her might tip the balance. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because Aaron made the hurtful comment first, and the author's reaction, while perhaps not the best, was a response to being body-shamed. However, her spamming after he blocked her might be a separate issue. Since the question is about making Aaron feel like shit, which he did by his comment, and the author's response was a reaction to that. So she might not be in the wrong.\n"
