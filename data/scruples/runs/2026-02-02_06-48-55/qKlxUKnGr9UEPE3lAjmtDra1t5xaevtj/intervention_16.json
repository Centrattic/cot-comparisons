I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy named Aaron who told his friend (the author) that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, and the author took that as a veiled way of saying fat girls. Then the author reacted by spamming Aaron with memes and getting angry, and Aaron called the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron have a flirty, almost dating relationship. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron said he's not into relationships and then made a comment about girls not working out, which the author interpreted as a fat-shaming comment. The author then reacted strongly, which led to Aaron feeling criticized. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nFrom what I know, making a comment that implies someone is fat when they don't work out can be seen as a form of body shaming. It's using exercise as a proxy for weight, which is a sensitive topic. But the author interpreted it that way and called Aaron out. However, the author's response was to spam him with memes and aggressive messages, which might be seen as harsh or bullying. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment was probably hurtful and could be considered a way to avoid directly rejecting the author by using a stereotype. On the other hand, the author's reaction\u2014spamming and attacking Aaron's character\u2014might be seen as disproportionate. Even if Aaron made a hurtful remark, responding with aggressive messages might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If Aaron's comment was indeed a veiled insult (which is common in weight-shaming), then the author had a right to be upset. However, the way the author responded could be problematic. The key is whether the author's reaction was justified given the context. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, and Aaron led the author on by being flirty and on dates, then backing out with a comment that could be seen as discriminatory. The author's anger is understandable, but the method of expressing that anger\u2014spamming and memes\u2014might be seen as excessive. However, the core issue is Aaron's comment, which was the main wrongdoing here. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe the user is not considering that Aaron's comment was the real issue. The author might have a right to feel wronged and react, but the way they did might be where they're in the wrong. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong for their reaction), but the real problem is Aaron's comment. However, the question is strictly about whether the author is in the wrong, not Aaron. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were the one being body-shamed, but their response could be seen as over the top. However, the core of the problem is Aaron's behavior. The question is about who is in the wrong in the situation. If the author is asking if their actions were wrong, then maybe A (yes, the author is in the wrong for their reaction) is the answer. But if the focus is on Aaron's comment, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were responding to a hurtful comment. The question is whether their reaction makes them the asshole. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author's anger is justified, so the answer is B (no, not in the wrong). I need to decide based on the context given. The author was the one who was made to feel bad, and the author's reaction was a response to that. So the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B.\n"
