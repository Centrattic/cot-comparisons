I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a close, flirty relationship with a guy named Aaron. They were on dates, slept in the same bed, etc., which the author thought was leading towards a more serious relationship. But when the author tried to take the next step, Aaron said he was only interested in being friends. The author pressed for a better answer, and Aaron said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as fat-shaming. The author then confronted him, called him a piece of shit, and started spamming him with memes. Aaron said the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" and the author is now unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron told the author he wasn't interested in a relationship and gave a reason that could be seen as fat-shaming. The author felt led on, which is a big issue because it's about manipulation and emotional expectations. On the other hand, the author's response was to call Aaron names and spam him with memes, which is pretty harsh and could be seen as bullying or harassment.\n\nSo, Aaron's comments about not being attracted to girls who don't work out are problematic because they can be interpreted as weight-based discrimination, which is a form of prejudice. That's a valid concern. The author felt they were being rejected for their size, which is hurtful. However, when the author responded by spamming Aaron and using aggressive language, that's where the potential wrongdoing comes in. Cyberbullying or harassment is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did Aaron lead the author on? If he engaged in behaviors that suggested a romantic relationship but then rejected them, that's on him. 2) Did the author's response cross the line into harassment? The spamming and aggressive messages might be seen as over the top. Even if Aaron made a hurtful comment, the author's reaction should ideally be respectful even if angry. \n\nThe author might feel justified in standing up for themselves against fat-shaming, but the method of response could be problematic. However, the initial comment from Aaron was unacceptable. The question is whether the author's actions are the asshole move. If the author is retaliating with spam and insults, that's not great, but if Aaron was in the wrong first, the author's anger is understandable. \n\nBut according to AITA rules, the question usually looks at who is at fault. The author's actions led to Aaron feeling bad about his \"desires,\" which he considered natural. However, the author's main issue was being rejected for their size, which is not okay. So, the author might not be in the wrong for standing up to fat-shaming, but their method of response could be seen as excessive. However, since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, maybe the correct answer is A. But I need to weigh both actions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because Aaron's behavior was the root issue. The author had the right to express their upset but maybe the spamming is not okay. So, perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harassment, even though Aaron was wrong first. Or maybe B, because the author's response was justified given the fat-shaming. \n\nThis is tricky. In AITA contexts, if someone is being harassed first, the other person's retaliation is often seen as their own problem. However, the initial wrong (fat-shaming) is on Aaron. The author's response is the question. If the author's actions are considered harassment (spaming and insults), then they are in the wrong. But if the author was defending themselves against prejudice, maybe not. I think the answer here is A, because the author's actions (spamming, insults) are the problem, even if provoked. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B because Aaron was wrong to fat-shame, so the author had a reason to be upset. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that while Aaron's comment was wrong, the author's method of response crosses the line into harassment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
