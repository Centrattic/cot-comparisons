I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author had a friend named Aaron, and their relationship was very flirty, with dates and sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were more than friends. Then, during a conversation, Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship and mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, he confirmed it was about her being fat. The author was really upset, called him a piece of shit, and started spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron said she was being an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" Now the author is conflicted, feeling both bad and justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron led her on by having a flirty, quasi-dating relationship, then rejected her based on her size. The author called him out and expressed her anger through spamming messages. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: leading her on by creating a romantic atmosphere without being clear. That's not good. If he wasn't interested in a relationship, maybe he shouldn't have engaged in flirty behavior and dates. So he's at fault there for not being honest.\n\nThen, when rejecting her, he used a comment that could be seen as fat-shaming. Saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out (which implies fat girls) is a problem because it's a judgment based on appearance, which is not okay. So his comment was hurtful and discriminatory.\n\nThe author's reaction: she called him out, told him she was upset, and then spammed him with memes. The memes were about body image, which is a valid topic. However, spamming someone's Facebook could be seen as harassment or not respecting their boundaries. Even if she was hurt, using public shaming or spamming might be crossing a line. But given the context of being led on and then rejected with fat-shaming, her anger is understandable.\n\nSo, Aaron's behavior was wrong in leading her on and then making a derogatory comment. The author's reaction was emotional and maybe a bit excessive (spamming), but her anger stems from being manipulated and fat-shamed. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the balance. If the author's actions were a proportionate response to being wronged, maybe not. But spamming someone with memes could be seen as unkind, even if he was in the wrong.\n\nHowever, considering the context of being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming comment, her reaction is more about defending herself. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she was reacting to his harmful actions. But the spamming might be a problem. But maybe he was the one who was in the wrong, so she's justified in her anger. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
