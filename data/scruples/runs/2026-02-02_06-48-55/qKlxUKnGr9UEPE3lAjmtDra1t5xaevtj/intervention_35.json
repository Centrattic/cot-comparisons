I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author had a flirty, almost dating relationship with their friend Aaron. The author thought they were getting serious, but Aaron said he's happy being friends. Then the author pushes for more, and Aaron says he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a comment on her weight. The author confronts him, and they argue, leading to the author spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is now unsure if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: Aaron said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as being about her weight. She then confronts him, calls him a piece of shit, and spams him with messages. He responds by saying she made him feel bad for his natural desires.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, whether Aaron's comment was okay. Saying he's not into girls who don't work out could be a euphemism for weight, which might be a problem. But maybe he's just into fitness? But using \"work out\" as a proxy for weight can be problematic because it's often tied to body size stereotypes. So maybe Aaron's comment is problematic, but the author's response is to spam him with memes and call him names. \n\nNow, the author's actions. She was hurt and angry, which is understandable. But spamming him with memes, even if they're about body image, might be seen as attacking him for his personal preferences. The author says she told him he was a piece of shit and then kept sending messages. Aaron says she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires,\" which might be his way of defending his comment about her weight. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If Aaron made a hurtful comment about her body, the author's reaction is a response to being insulted. But maybe the author escalated things by spamming him. On the other hand, Aaron's comment was about her physical attributes in a way that's derogatory. So the author had a right to be upset. However, responding with aggression might not be the healthiest way. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If Aaron's comment was a dealbreaker and the author confronted him about it, that's fair. But then continuing to spam him with memes after the conversation might cross a line. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the spamming, but not entirely. But the user thinks she is in the wrong. Alternatively, if Aaron made a comment that was hurtful, the author isn't wrong for reacting. \n\nWait, but the author's actions after the conversation: spamming him with memes. That's probably where the line is crossed. Even if Aaron said something hurtful, responding with aggressive messages and calls could be seen as the author being in the wrong. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she escalated the situation by spamming him and attacking his \"natural desires,\" which he was honest about, albeit possibly in a hurtful way.\n"
