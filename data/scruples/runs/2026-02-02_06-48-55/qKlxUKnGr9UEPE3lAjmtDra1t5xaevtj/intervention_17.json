I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend named Aaron who told the author that she would be his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then also said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author felt led on because their relationship was flirty and they had dates, etc. When the author wanted to take it to the next level, Aaron said he wanted to stay friends. The author confronted him, and Aaron said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a comment on her weight. The author then called him a shit and started spamming him with memes. He called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" Now the author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend Aaron made conflicting statements: saying she's his ideal girlfriend but then stating a preference against girls who don't work out. The author felt Aaron led her on because their interactions were more than friends. When she wanted to escalate the relationship, he rejected her, citing the workout comment. The author then reacted angrily, leading to the conflict.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, Aaron's comments about girls not working out were a veiled insult about her weight, which she took personally. Her reaction was defensive and confrontational. She felt justified in calling him out and spamming him with memes. However, she's now second-guessing if her response was appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron might feel that he was honest about his preferences, even if it came out harshly. He might believe he wasn't the one leading her on, but rather she misinterpreted his signals. His comment about girls who don't work out could be a genuine preference, though it's problematic because it implies a body-shaming attitude. However, he might not see it as a personal attack but as a general statement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions after Aaron's comment could be seen as aggressive. Spamming him with memes, even if humorous, is a form of harassment. Calling him a \"piece of shit\" and being confrontational might escalate the situation unnecessarily. However, the initial dynamic where Aaron gave mixed signals (flirty behavior vs. rejecting the relationship) could be where the responsibility lies more with Aaron for not being clear.\n\nThe author felt led on, which is a common issue in relationships where one person isn't clear about their intentions. If Aaron was indeed leading her on by engaging in flirty behavior and dates without clarifying his feelings, then he might be at fault for not being honest. However, once he rejected her, the author's reaction of anger and spamming could be seen as her taking it out on him, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn terms of the actual question: Is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether her response was justified given the context. If Aaron was indeed leading her on, then her frustration is understandable. However, her method of dealing with it\u2014harassment and insults\u2014might not be appropriate. On the flip side, if Aaron was honest about his preferences, even if it was hurtful, the author's response could be seen as overreacting. But considering that Aaron's comment about girls who don't work out is a form of body shaming, which is offensive, the author's reaction to that might be justified. However, the way she handled it (spamming and insults) is problematic.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but her response was not the healthiest. Aaron's initial behavior and comments were definitely problematic, leading to the conflict. However, the author's reaction could have been handled more respectfully. So, while there's fault on both sides, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the author escalated the situation with her actions after Aaron's comment, she might share some responsibility. But if Aaron was the one who led her on, then he's more at fault. The challenge here is determining who started the conflict. The author's perspective is that she was led on, so her reaction is a defense mechanism. However, her response was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be that she's partially at fault, but not entirely. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. If Aaron was indeed leading her on, then the author's anger is somewhat justified, but her method of handling it is not. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her response was overly aggressive, even if her feelings were hurt. Alternatively, if Aaron's behavior was more to blame, then the answer might be B. But given the way the question is framed, the author's actions (spamming, insults) are problematic, so the answer is A.\n"
