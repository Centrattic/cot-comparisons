I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy named Aaron who's been acting all flirty with the author, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author wants to take things further, he says he's not interested because she doesn't work out, implying she's fat. The author then calls him out and starts spamming him with memes. He responds by saying she's making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is unsure if she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Aaron led her on by being flirty and engaging in activities that suggest a romantic or sexual relationship. When she wants to move forward, he backs out and gives a reason that seems to be about her body image. The author confronts him, which he takes as being shamed for his preferences. She then spams him with memes, which he blocks. She's conflicted about if she was in the wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about whether she's at fault. Aaron's actions of leading her on could be a big part of this. If he wasn't interested in a relationship, maybe he shouldn't have engaged in those flirty behaviors. On the other hand, when she confronts him about his comment, she uses aggressive memes, which might be seen as attacking him. However, he made a derogatory remark about her body, which is clearly harmful. The author's response, while maybe harsh, could be a reaction to being called fat and feeling disrespected. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for calling him out? If Aaron's comment was about her size, that's a form of fat-shaming, which is wrong. Confronting someone about that isn't necessarily the problem. However, spamming him with memes might be crossing a line, even if he was rude. The key is whether her actions were justified in response to his. If he was being cruel, her response might be seen as self-defense, but if she escalated it unnecessarily, maybe she's at fault. \n\nAlso, the part where he says she's making him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" is problematic. His preference is not a natural desire that justifies disrespecting someone. So the author defending herself against fat-shaming is in her right, but her method of response might be questionable. However, considering the initial issue was his comment about her weight, her reaction is understandable. \n\nIn terms of the question: \"Is the author in the wrong?\" If the answer is A, yes (she's wrong), then it's because she should have handled it differently. If B, no, then it's because he was the one who led her on and made a harmful comment. \n\nI think the main issue here is Aaron's fat-shaming. The author was justified in confronting him for that. However, spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive, but given the context, maybe it's a reaction to being hurt. So the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the root issue is Aaron's behavior.\n"
