I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) who got rejected is in the wrong for making their friend feel bad after the friend said they're not attracted to girls who don't work out, implying the author is fat.\n\nFirst, the friend, Aaron, told the author he's happy just being friends but then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out. The author took it as a jab at their weight and responded angrily, calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming his social media with memes about body size. Aaron then blocked the author and accused them of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe author is conflicted: they feel half bad but also think they said what needed to be said. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking another opinion.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a backhanded way of saying he's not attracted to the author's body. That's hurtful and disrespectful. The author's reaction, while possibly harsh (spamming with memes), was in response to being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming comment. \n\nHowever, responding by calling him names and spamming social media could be seen as excessive. But given the context of being emotionally manipulated (led on with flirty behavior, dates, etc.), the author's frustration is understandable. The key point is whether the author's response was justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn relationships where there's a mix of friendship and romantic tension, being rejected after being led on can lead to strong emotional reactions. The author's anger stems from feeling used and then fat-shamed. While their method of expressing that anger might not be ideal, the underlying issue is about respect and honesty. \n\nSo, while the author's response was harsh, it's a reaction to being treated poorly. The real fault lies with Aaron for the fat-shaming comment and leading on. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a right to be upset. However, the way they expressed it could have been more constructive. But given the context, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole, as their actions were a response to being mistreated. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering the context, I think the author's response, while not perfect, was a justified reaction to being fat-shamed and led on. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
