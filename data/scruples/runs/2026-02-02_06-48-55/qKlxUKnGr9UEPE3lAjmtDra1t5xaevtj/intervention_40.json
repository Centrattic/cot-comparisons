I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves Aaron, who led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, making her believe they were moving towards a relationship. Then, when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron rejected her, citing that he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, called him a piece of shit, and then spammed him with memes. Aaron responded by calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was led on by Aaron, which is a form of emotional manipulation. Aaron's rejection was based on her body size, which is a sensitive and potentially discriminatory reason. The author's reaction involved anger and public shaming via memes. While Aaron's behavior was hurtful and disrespectful, the author's response of spamming him with memes might be seen as excessive or retaliatory. However, given that Aaron was the one who was leading her on and then being dismissive, her anger is understandable. The key here is whether her actions were a justified response to being treated poorly. If the author's actions were a direct result of being misled and insulted, that could mitigate her wrongdoing. On the other hand, public shaming can be harmful and unprofessional. But considering the context of being wronged, some might argue she's not in the wrong. Still, the answer might lean towards A if the author's response was overly harsh. But given that Aaron was the one who was rude and dismissive, maybe B is the answer. I'm a bit torn but need to decide based on the balance of both sides.\n"
