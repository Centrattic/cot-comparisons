I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a complicated situation with their friend Aaron.\n\nFirst, the background: The user and Aaron have been friends for a few months, with a flirty dynamic, dates, and even sleeping together. The user felt they were in a relationship and wanted to take it further. Aaron, however, said he's happy just being friends and isn't into a relationship. The key part here is when Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a veiled way of saying he's not into fat women. The author confronts him, and he confirms that he meant they're fat. The author then lashes out, calling Aaron a piece of shit and sending memes about body size. Aaron responds by saying the author is making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author still feels partially responsible but also justified.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Misunderstanding Intentions**: The user thought they were in a relationship and wanted to take it to the next level. Aaron clarified he wasn't interested. The user might feel led on, which could be Aaron's fault for not being clear. But the user also assumed they were in a relationship based on flirty behavior and dates, which might not have been mutual.\n\n2. **Comment on Body Type**: Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (interpreted as fat) is clearly a personal opinion, albeit potentially hurtful. The user confronts him about this, which is understandable. However, reacting by spamming him with memes and aggressive messages might be seen as overly harsh, even if justified in feeling hurt.\n\n3. **Emotional Response**: The user's reaction is intense. While being rejected and called fat is hurtful, the method of response (spamming, using memes that mock Aaron's opinion) could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. Aaron's response about his \"natural desires\" is problematic because it's a way of dismissing the user's feelings, but the user's retaliation might also be seen as crossing a line.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong to confront someone about a hurtful comment? Probably not. But the way the user did it\u2014spamming and attacking\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. However, the user was clearly hurt and angry, so their emotional reaction is understandable. The question is whether their actions were in the wrong, regardless of intent.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics and Fat Shaming**: The situation involves body shaming from Aaron, which is definitely on him. The user's response, while harsh, could be a form of standing up for themselves. But public shaming (spamming Facebook) might not be the best way to handle it. However, the user isn't making Aaron feel bad for fatphobic views; they're responding to being told they're not attractive because of their size.\n\n6. **Communication and Clarity**: Aaron's lack of clarity in their relationship status might be part of the problem. But once he made the comment about body type, the user had every right to be upset. The user's actions, while perhaps impulsive, are a direct response to being personally insulted.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions are a reaction to being rejected and fat-shamed. While the method of response is questionable (spamming), the emotional context is important. The primary wrong might lie with Aaron for his comment, but the user's reaction might also be seen as over the top. However, considering the context of being led on and then being insulted, the user's actions aren't entirely in the wrong. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have some responsibility, but the user's actions were a direct response to being hurt, so the answer might not be a clear 'yes' they're in the wrong.\n"
