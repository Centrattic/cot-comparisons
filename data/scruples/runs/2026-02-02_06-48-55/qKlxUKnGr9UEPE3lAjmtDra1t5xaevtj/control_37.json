I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who had a flirty, almost romantic relationship with the author. The key issue is that Aaron told the author he would be her ideal boyfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. After the author wants to take things further, Aaron backs out, mentions his attraction is to women who work out (implying the author is fat), and they end up in a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author felt led on by Aaron's actions\u2014flirty behavior, dates, sleeping in the same bed. When she wanted a commitment, Aaron didn't want to, and his comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is the main point of contention. The author then responds by spamming his Facebook with memes criticizing him, which he finds offensive and calls her an asshole.\n\nSo, Aaron's comment about attraction based on working out could be seen as fat-shaming. The author is justified in feeling hurt and angry because he essentially dismissed her based on her body size. His statement that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out is a judgment about her body, which is offensive. The author's reaction, while maybe harsh (spamming Facebook), is a response to being hurt. She's calling out his insensitivity, which is fair. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? He said he wasn't attracted to her because of her weight. She reacted by expressing her anger and trying to hold him accountable for his hurtful words. While sending memes might be confrontational, it's a common way people express frustration online. He called her an asshole, but his initial comment was the root of the problem. The author isn't the one being offensive here; she's responding to his fat-shaming. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
