I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend named Aaron who said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a coded way of saying he doesn't like fat girls. The author confronts him, and they have a heated argument. The author then spams Aaron's social media with memes about body size, leading to Aaron blocking them and calling the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a backhanded way of implying that the author is fat, which is a body-shaming remark. The author's reaction is to confront Aaron and then spam him with memes. \n\nThe author's actions after the argument\u2014spamming with memes\u2014could be seen as aggressive and possibly hurtful. However, Aaron's initial comment was also hurtful and discriminatory. The author was in a flirty, ambiguous relationship and felt led on. When confronted, Aaron's response was dismissive and insulting based on the author's body. \n\nOn one hand, the author's right to express their hurt and anger is valid. On the other, using social media to spam might be excessive. However, given that Aaron's comment was a direct insult based on the author's body, which is a sensitive and often taboo topic, the author's reaction is a form of self-advocacy. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are: Did the author overreact? The author's actions were in response to a hurtful comment. Aaron's statement was about the author's body, which is a personal and sensitive issue. The author's retaliation, while aggressive, was a reaction to being body-shamed. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is criticized based on their body, especially in a context where there was prior intimacy, the person being criticized is within their right to feel wronged and to respond. However, the method of response (spamming social media) could be seen as inappropriate. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were justified given the context. Since Aaron made a derogatory comment about the author's body, the author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to that. The fact that Aaron called the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires\" suggests that Aaron is deflecting his own discriminatory behavior. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to a hurtful and discriminatory comment. The answer would be B (No).\n"
