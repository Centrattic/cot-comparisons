I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has been in a flirty, semi-relationship with their friend Aaron for a few months. They've gone on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he was only into friends and clarified that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. She got angry, called him a piece of shit, and then spammed him with memes about body size. Aaron called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" but the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is upset because Aaron led her on by being flirty and engaging in behaviors that suggest a romantic relationship, but when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her based on her weight. That's a problem because leading someone on is generally not acceptable. However, the author's response was to spam him with memes that might be considered hurtful or mocking. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, Aaron's rejection was based on her weight, which is a valid reason to feel hurt and angry. Plus, he had been leading her on, which is manipulative. On the other hand, her response of spamming him with memes could be seen as harassing or not respectful, even if she was upset.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. She was justified in feeling wronged, but her reaction of spamming him might have crossed a line. However, the initial problem was Aaron's behavior. The article is asking if she's the asshole, so if her actions were a reasonable response to being disrespected, then she's not in the wrong. But if her response was excessive, then she might be. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people might argue that while Aaron was wrong to reject her based on her weight and lead her on, the author's retaliation (spamming with memes) could be seen as bullying. However, given that the initial issue was his behavior, some might side with her. \n\nAnother angle: the author was defending herself against a comment about her body, which is sensitive. Calling him a name and reacting strongly might be within her right, especially if she felt disrespected. But spamming him with memes might be seen as taking it too far. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the right because Aaron's actions were the root problem. However, her response could be seen as harsh. But given the context, maybe she's not the asshole. The answer depends on whether the response is considered disproportionate. Since the initial problem was leading her on and making a body-shaming comment, her reaction, while maybe not perfect, is a result of being wronged. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
