I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend named Aaron who told the author that she's his ideal girlfriend but then later mentioned he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him and gets angry, leading to her spamming his Facebook with memes about body size. Aaron says she's making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and now the author is questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. Let's break it down. The author and Aaron had a relationship that was more than friends\u2014flirty, dates, sleeping in the same bed. This suggests that there was some level of intimacy and expectation of a romantic relationship. When the author wants to take it further, Aaron declines, stating he's not into relationships and then specifies he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a comment on her weight.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and respect in relationships. When someone is leading on a partner by acting in a romantic or intimate way but isn't genuinely interested, that's a problem. Aaron might be at fault for leading the author on if he wasn't serious about a relationship. However, when the author confronts him, his response is to say he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out and confirms it's about her being fat. That's a hurtful and potentially discriminatory comment. \n\nThe author's reaction is to call him out, which is understandable given the hurtful comment. She then spams his Facebook with memes that mock his behavior. While confronting someone is okay, spamming with memes might be considered aggressive or unprofessional in some contexts. However, given the context of a personal relationship and the hurt she's feeling, it's a way of expressing her frustration. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong (Option A) or not (Option B). The author is reacting to being rejected and being told she's fat, which is a valid emotional response. However, the way she's retaliating by spamming his Facebook could be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, Aaron's comment was clearly hurtful and discriminatory, so the author has a valid reason to be upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response is justified. If the author is reacting to being insulted about her body, then her anger is understandable. But the method\u2014spamming Facebook\u2014might be excessive. However, in personal relationships, people sometimes act out with strong emotions. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to being hurt and disrespected.\n\nIn conclusion, while Aaron's comment was clearly hurtful and the author has grounds to be upset, the act of spamming Facebook memes might be seen as over the top. But considering the emotional context, it's a reaction to being insulted. The main issue is Aaron leading her on and making a discriminatory comment. The author isn't the asshole here because she was responding to being disrespected and was trying to hold him accountable. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
