I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the key points.\n\nThe author is in a situation where they have a flirty, close relationship with a guy named Aaron. They've gone on dates, slept together, and the author felt like they were more than friends. Then, Aaron tells them they're his \"ideal girlfriend\" but also says he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a code for fat girls. The author confronts Aaron, who confirms he meant that. The author gets angry, calls Aaron a piece of shit, and then spams him with memes related to their size. Aaron responds by saying the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and blocks them. The author is conflicted about whether they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me break it down. First, Aaron led the author on by being flirty and having a close relationship, which could be seen as leading the author to believe there was a romantic possibility. Then, when rejecting the author, he uses a comment that's clearly weight-shaming. The author confronts him, and he admits to the fat-shaming. The author then publicly shames him with memes, which might be excessive and hurtful. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is discriminatory and hurtful. The author has every right to be upset about being fat-shamed, especially after being led on. On the other hand, the author's response of spamming Aaron with memes might be seen as retaliatory and potentially public shaming, which could be hurtful and unprofessional.\n\nBut let's consider the context. Aaron admitted that his comment was about the author's weight, which is a direct insult. The author's reaction is in response to being rejected and then being shamed for their body. The memes are likely related to body positivity or size acceptance, which might be the author's way of standing up for themselves. However, spamming someone with such content, especially after an argument, can be seen as harassment or bullying. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. If Aaron made a fat-shaming comment, the author is justified in being upset. However, publicly shaming him with memes might cross the line into cyberbullying. But given that Aaron admitted to the comment, the author's actions could be seen as defending their self-respect. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, Aaron definitely made a hurtful, discriminatory comment. The author's response, while perhaps excessive, is a reaction to being rejected and then being fat-shamed. The question is whether the author's actions are warranted. If the author is standing up for themselves against weight-based discrimination, that's understandable. But the method of doing so by spamming could be problematic. \n\nHowever, in the context of the situation\u2014being led on, then rejected with a derogatory comment\u2014the author's anger and frustration might be justified. The \"asshole\" comment and the spamming could be impulsive reactions, but the root cause is Aaron's behavior. So, the author might not be entirely at fault, but perhaps there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is held accountable for their own actions regardless of the other person's faults. Here, the author's actions (spamming, calling names) might be seen as the problem, even if Aaron was wrong. But others might argue that the author is defending themselves against a toxic person. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriate. While Aaron's comment was awful, the author's public shaming could be seen as in the wrong. However, given the context, some might argue that the author had a right to be upset. But in terms of traditional AITA, the public shaming and name-calling might make the author the asshole, even if they were wronged. Alternatively, others might side with the author because they were being fat-shamed. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to decide. \n\nGiven that the author took a public and aggressive stance against Aaron's fat-shaming, which is a serious issue, but used methods that could be considered harassment, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, considering that the root problem was Aaron's behavior, and the author was defending themselves, but their actions were perhaps too harsh, there's a case for both sides. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. If the author was wronged first, but then reacted in a way that's also problematic, they might still be considered the asshole for their response. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction, while understandable, was disproportionate. However, others might say B (No) because the author had a right to be angry. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author's public shaming via spamming is problematic, regardless of the reason. So, even though Aaron was wrong, the author's actions might be considered in the wrong because they took it too far. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
