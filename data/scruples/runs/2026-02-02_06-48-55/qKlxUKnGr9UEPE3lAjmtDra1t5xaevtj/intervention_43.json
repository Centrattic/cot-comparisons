I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating situation for a few months. They go on dates, sleep in the same bed, etc. The author thinks they're more than friends. Then, after watching a show, the author tries to take the relationship to the next level. Aaron says he's happy just being friends, but the author wants more. Aaron says he's just not into a relationship and mentions not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on weight. The author confronts him, and Aaron admits it's about being fat. The author gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and starts spamming him with memes. Aaron blocks them but says the author was an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty in relationships, respect, and how both parties handled things. Let's break it down. First, Aaron led the author on by being flirty and engaging in date-like activities, which could be seen as leading them on. The author, believing they had a chance, tried to move things forward, only to be rejected for a reason that seems superficial and potentially discriminatory. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be a form of fat-shaming, which is generally considered inappropriate and hurtful.\n\nNow, the author's response: they were upset, called Aaron names, and spammed him with memes. While the author has a right to feel hurt and express anger, spamming with memes might be seen as crossing a line. However, Aaron's initial rejection was based on a judgment about the author's body, which is problematic. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from being hurt and possibly realizing they were led on. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the actions: Aaron was dishonest about his true feelings earlier, leading the author on. The author confronted him, which is a valid response when someone feels misled. However, the method of response\u2014spamming and using memes\u2014might be seen as immature or aggressive. On the other hand, Aaron's comment about body type is unacceptable, so the author's anger is justified.\n\nIn terms of who's more in the wrong: Aaron led on, made a discriminatory comment, and then blamed the author for being an asshole. The author's actions were a reaction to being rejected for a reason they found offensive. While the author's response could be more measured, the root cause is Aaron's actions. However, the author's behavior also escalated the situation.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (author not wrong). Based on this analysis, the main issue is Aaron's behavior. The author's reaction is a response to being treated poorly. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the author's actions (spamming, calling names) do cross into potentially being an asshole as well. It's a bit of a grey area. However, given that Aaron made a discriminatory comment, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the author's response was overly harsh, maybe A. But given the context of being led on and fat-shamed, B seems more appropriate.\n"
