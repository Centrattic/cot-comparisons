I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a conflict with their friend Aaron. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost romantic relationship for months, going on dates and spending the night together. When the author wants to take it further, Aaron says he's happy being friends and isn't into relationships. Then, when pressed, he mentions not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author confronts him, calls him names, and spams his social media. Aaron says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron led the author on with flirtatious behavior and physical closeness, which could imply mutual interest. When the author wants a commitment, he backs out and gives a vague reason that the author takes as a personal attack. The author then reacts emotionally, which can be seen as justified given the lead-up. \n\nBut wait, the author did send aggressive messages and called Aaron names. That's where things might tip into being in the wrong. However, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a veiled way of expressing body-shaming, which is hurtful. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to being objectified and led on. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and respect are key. Aaron's comment was discriminatory, and the author had the right to be upset. However, how the author expressed her anger\u2014spamming with memes and name-calling\u2014might be seen as unprofessional or overly aggressive, even if justified. Still, considering the context of being led on and then criticized for her body, the author's actions stem from hurt and a defense of self-respect. \n\nThe key points: Aaron's behavior was manipulative and disrespectful, and the author's reaction, while intense, was a response to that. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; the problem is more on Aaron's side. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
