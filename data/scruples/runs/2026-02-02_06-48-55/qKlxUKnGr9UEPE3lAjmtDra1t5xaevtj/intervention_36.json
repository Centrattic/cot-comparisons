I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a friend named Aaron who said the author is his ideal girlfriend but then also made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels that Aaron led her on by being flirty and engaging in date-like activities, which could be interpreted as giving mixed signals. Then, when the author pushes for a relationship, Aaron backs out and makes a comment about her weight. That's definitely hurtful and inappropriate. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic and could be seen as fat-shaming. The author's reaction is to confront Aaron and call him out, which seems justified given the hurtful remark. However, the author did spam him with memes that might be considered aggressive or confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment was the trigger, and the author's response was a reaction to being insulted. On the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, maybe by not spamming him excessively or using harsh memes. But the root cause is Aaron's disrespectful comment. \n\nThe key points are: Did Aaron's comment justify the author's reaction? And was the author in the wrong for reacting the way she did? Since Aaron made a fat-shaming remark, the author's anger and confrontation might be reasonable. However, the method of response (spamming with memes) could be seen as harsh. But overall, the initial wrong was Aaron's comment. \n\nSo, considering that the author was responding to a hurtful statement, even if her response was a bit aggressive, the main fault lies with Aaron. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
