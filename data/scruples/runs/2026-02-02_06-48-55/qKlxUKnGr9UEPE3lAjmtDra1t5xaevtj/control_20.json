I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who told the author he would be her ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. They had a flirty relationship with dates and sleeping together, so the author thought there was a chance for a real relationship. When she pushed for more, he said he's not into it and specifically mentioned working out, leading her to accuse him of being fat-shaming. She then sent memes to him on Facebook and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a way to avoid being direct and hurtful. But the author feels it's a veiled insult about her size. It's possible that Aaron was being honest about his preferences without intending to be mean, but the way he phrased it might have been insensitive. The author's reaction involved spamming him with memes that criticize his comment, which could be seen as aggressive or hurtful. However, she also stood up for herself after feeling led on. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she did confront him and then continued with the memes, which might be considered overreacting. But she had a right to be upset if he was using a euphemism to avoid hurting her feelings. The key points are whether the author's response was justified given the context of being led on and the potential fat-shaming. \n\nOn one hand, responding with spam memes might be seen as venting rather than a mature resolution. On the other hand, she was hurt and felt disrespected, so her reaction could be a result of that emotion. The question is if she went too far. The community often looks at intent and impact. If Aaron's comment was indeed discriminatory, then the author's response might be seen as a valid stand against that. However, if he was just being honest in a tactless way, her reaction could be harsh. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the comment was a polite way to decline or a harmful stereotype. The author's actions were reactive, but is that the right approach? Maybe she should have expressed her feelings without escalating it, but her feelings of being led on are significant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. She had the right to express her hurt and set boundaries. However, her method of spamming could be seen as immature. But given Aaron's possible insensitivity, the answer might be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
