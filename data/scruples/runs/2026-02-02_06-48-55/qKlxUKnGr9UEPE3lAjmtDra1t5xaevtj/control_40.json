I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where a friend, Aaron, led her on and then made a comment about her weight. The key points here are about emotional manipulation and honesty.\n\nFirst, the author and Aaron had a relationship that was more than friends, with dates and physical intimacy. He didn't make his feelings clear, which led her to believe there was a chance for a real relationship. Then, when she pushed for more, he rejected her by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a comment on her weight. She confronted him, and he admitted it was about her being fat.\n\nHe called her out for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is unsure if her reaction was justified. She sent memes about body size, which might be hurtful. But Aaron's comment about his attraction being based on appearance is problematic because it's a superficial reason and could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to being rejected in a hurtful way. However, her retaliation with memes might be harsh. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she was led on and then rejected for a shallow reason, her reaction is understandable. But the way she responded might be disproportionate. However, given the context of emotional manipulation and then a discriminatory remark, she's not entirely at fault. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
