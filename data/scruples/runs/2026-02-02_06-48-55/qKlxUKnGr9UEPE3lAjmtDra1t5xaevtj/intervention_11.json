I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend Aaron who told the author he would be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as fat girls. The author then reacted strongly, called Aaron names, and sent memes. Aaron felt bad and accused the author of making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron led the author on by being flirty and going on dates but then rejected her, citing her weight. The author felt hurt and responded angrily. Now Aaron is defensive, saying his preferences are natural. The author is conflicted between feeling bad and thinking she was right to confront him.\n\nFrom what I understand, the author was in a situation where she felt Aaron was being insincere\u2014flirting and leading her on. Then, when she pushed for a commitment, he rejected her using a comment about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author's reaction was to lash out, which can be seen as hurtful. But Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a euphemism for fat-shaming. \n\nHowever, responding by spamming him with memes and calling him a name might be excessive, even if she was hurt. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and not the most constructive. But Aaron's initial comment was hurtful and disrespectful, so the author might feel justified in standing up for herself. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, Aaron's comment about the author's weight is definitely inappropriate, which might absolve the author from being in the wrong entirely. However, the way she responded\u2014spaming him and name-calling\u2014could be seen as unkind, even if she was hurt. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because she reacted harshly. If B (no), it's because Aaron's comment was offensive, so her response was justified. Given that Aaron made a hurtful comment first, the author's reaction might be seen as a defense, so perhaps she's not in the wrong. But the way she followed up with spamming and name-calling could tip the scales. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that Aaron's comment was the initial wrongdoing, and the author's reaction, while not perfect, is a response to that. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But maybe she overreacted. However, considering the context, her reaction might be understandable. So I'm leaning towards B (no), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
