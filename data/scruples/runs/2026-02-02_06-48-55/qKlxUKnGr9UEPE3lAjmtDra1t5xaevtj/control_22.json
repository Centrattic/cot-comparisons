I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is in a situation where they have a close relationship with a guy named Aaron. They've been spending a lot of time together, doing things that could be considered dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author tries to move things to a more serious level, Aaron says he's not interested in a relationship and specifically mentions he's not attracted to girls who don't work out. The author interprets this as a comment on their weight (being fat). They get angry, tell Aaron to leave, and then spam him with memes about size. Aaron blocks them but says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: He led the author on by having a flirty, close relationship but wasn't honest about his feelings. When the author wanted to take it further, he rejected her, using a comment that could be seen as fat-shaming. That's clearly hurtful and perhaps hypocritical if he was leading her on. However, he did express his feelings, even if in a hurtful way.\n\nThen the author's reaction: They got angry, called Aaron a \"piece of shit,\" and spammed him with memes. This could be seen as aggressive and potentially harassing. However, the author was hurt and felt disrespected by fat-shaming, which is a valid response to being made to feel bad about their body.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. Aaron didn't communicate his lack of interest clearly and used a hurtful comment. The author's response was defensive and emotional, but maybe they were justified in feeling betrayed and disrespected. On the other hand, spamming someone with memes after a confrontation might be considered over the line.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, fat-shaming is widely viewed as inappropriate and harmful. So Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. The author's anger and defense could be seen as a reaction to something offensive. However, the way they responded (spamming) is not ideal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that the author was reacting to being fat-shamed and trying to defend themselves, maybe not. But their response was not the best way to handle it. However, the initial problem was Aaron's fat-shaming. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh, were a reaction to being mistreated. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong because they were responding to an offensive comment. But some might argue that their response was uncalled for. However, given the context, the author's actions might be more about defending themselves against something hurtful.\n"
