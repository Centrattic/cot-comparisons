I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he's not interested in a relationship and made a comment about her not working out, implying she's fat. The author then called him a \"piece of shit\" and sent memes to his Facebook, leading to him blocking her and saying she made him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron had a flirtatious relationship with dates and physical intimacy. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he was only interested in friends and gave a reason related to not being attracted to girls who don't work out. The author confronted him, he admitted it was about her being fat, she expressed anger, and then sent memes that were critical. He blocked her after saying she made him feel bad.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment based on body size, which is problematic. But the author's reaction involved calling him names and spamming him with memes that mocked him. The question is whether her response was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment was hurtful and discriminatory, which is inexcusable. People shouldn't make snap judgments based on appearance. On the other hand, the author's response might be seen as aggressive. While she has a right to express her hurt and anger, spamming him with memes and continuing to message after he left could be seen as escalating the conflict. However, given that he was the one who initially made the offensive comment, his reaction of saying she made him feel bad might be misplaced. He initiated the hurtful remark, so the blame isn't entirely on the author.\n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. They might be considering that even though Aaron said something hurtful, the author's response was overly harsh. However, in such situations, people often react emotionally, especially when they feel led on. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. She had the right to be angry and express that, but spamming him with memes might not be the best approach. However, given the context of being led on and then receiving such a comment, her reaction is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether she is the asshole. If we consider the \"Asshole Index\" (AITA) criteria, sometimes the person who made the hurtful comment isn't the one seen as the asshole if their actions were justified. But in this case, Aaron made a derogatory remark about the author's body, which is a major issue. The author's response, while perhaps inappropriate in delivery, was a reaction to being insulted. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nIn many similar cases, the person who makes the initial hurtful comment is often the one considered the asshole, especially if they're not taking responsibility. Here, Aaron deflects by saying he's just stating his \"natural desires,\" which is a way to justify discrimination. The author's reaction, though perhaps aggressive, was in response to being insulted. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because she's defending herself against a discriminatory remark. However, the method she used (spamming with memes) might be seen as unprofessional or hurtful, but not necessarily making her the asshole.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that he had the right to be honest about his preferences, even if it's harsh. But making a comment about someone's weight or fitness level as a reason for not being interested is a common form of bias. So, while Aaron is not perfect, the author's reaction, while maybe over-the-top, is a response to being insulted. In that case, maybe she's not the asshole. \n\nBut I need to decide between A and B. If the answer is A (she's in the wrong), it's because her response was excessive. If B (she's not in the wrong), because Aaron's comment was the issue. Given that, I think the author's reaction, while not ideal, is a justified emotional response to being insulted and led on. Therefore, she's not the asshole. So the answer would be B.\n"
