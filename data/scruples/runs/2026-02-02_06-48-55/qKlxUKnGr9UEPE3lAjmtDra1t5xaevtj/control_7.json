I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who made some hurtful comments. \n\nFirst, the background: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost romantic relationship for a few months. They've gone on dates and slept in the same bed, leading the author to believe there's potential for a real relationship. Then, in a conversation, Aaron says he isn't interested in the author and mentions he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author confronted Aaron about the comment, and he admitted it was because she's fat. That's a clear instance of weight shaming, which is generally considered wrong. The author then responded by spamming him with memes related to body positivity, which might be seen as harsh but is a reaction to the hurtful comment.\n\nAaron later told the author she was an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is questioning if she was wrong to respond that way. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author overstepped in her response. While the author's initial reaction (calling him out and spamming him) might be seen as aggressive, it's in response to Aaron's harmful and discriminatory behavior. Weight-based comments are not acceptable, and the author is justified in being upset. However, the method of response\u2014spamming with memes\u2014might be considered unprofessional or excessive, even if the intent was to confront the issue. \n\nBut considering that Aaron led her on with flirty behavior and then made a discriminatory comment, the author's frustration is understandable. The question is whether her response was in the wrong. While the spamming might not be the best approach, the core issue is Aaron's behavior. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for herself after being mistreated. So, the answer would be B (No), because the author was defending herself against a discriminatory remark, even if her method was harsh. The responsibility for the situation lies more with Aaron for making the hurtful comment in the first place.\n"
