I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a complicated relationship where there's been a lot of flirting and what the author considers dates. The key issue is when Aaron says the author is his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then adds that he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author feels led on and responds angrily, which leads to Aaron feeling attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was in a situation where she thought there was a romantic relationship forming. When Aaron pulled back, she felt hurt and responded with anger and memes that were critical of him. Aaron, on the other hand, claims that his comment about working out was a \"natural desire\" and that the author's reaction made him feel bad.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if Aaron was being disrespectful, responding with spam and hurtful memes after he tried to end the conversation might be excessive. However, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as fat-shaming, which is definitely problematic. The author had the right to express her hurt, but the method of doing so via spamming social media with aggressive content might have crossed a line.\n\nOn the flip side, Aaron's initial behavior\u2014leading her on with flirty behavior and dates\u2014could have been misleading. If he wasn't interested in a relationship, he might have been in the wrong for not clarifying things sooner. The author's feelings were hurt, and her reaction, while harsh, stems from feeling manipulated. However, the way she responded could be seen as aggressive and not conducive to a respectful resolution.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response was justified. While her feelings were hurt, using memes that are critical of someone's character and spamming them after they tried to end the conversation could be considered over the top. On the other hand, Aaron's comment about her weight was inappropriate, giving her a reason to feel upset. The balance here is tricky. The author's right to feel wronged exists, but her method of expressing that might have been unkind. However, given that Aaron's behavior was also questionable, it's not entirely her fault.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though Aaron's comment was hurtful, the author's response was aggressive and public, which could be seen as unkind. But some might argue that given the context, she has a right to react. The line between expressing hurt and being an asshole is thin here. Given that the question is asking if she's in the wrong, I think the answer leans towards A because the response was public shaming and spamming, which is generally frowned upon, regardless of the provocation. But others might say that since he was fat-shaming, her reaction is justified, hence B.\n"
