I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author (the person telling the story) is the asshole here. So, the key points here are the interactions between the author and Aaron.\n\nFirst, the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating situation. They've gone on dates and slept in the same bed, which makes the author believe they were more than friends. Then, Aaron says he's happy with just being friends, but the author wants more. Aaron then tells her he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a comment on her weight. She gets angry, calls him a \"piece of shit,\" and starts spamming him with memes about body size. He eventually blocks her but says she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn Aaron's side, he might have made a comment about her weight, which is a sensitive topic and could be hurtful. He also ended the relationship, but his reasoning could be seen as body-shaming. Saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out might be a way of avoiding the real issue, especially if it's a veiled comment about her size.\n\nOn the author's side, she reacted strongly, called him names, and spammed him with memes. While the comment about weight was hurtful, responding with aggressive messages and calling him the biggest piece of shit might be seen as overreacting. However, she was in a situation where she felt led on and then rejected based on her body, which could justify her anger. The memes she sent might be a form of expressing her hurt, but spamming someone after being blocked is generally negative.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, honesty, and respect. If Aaron was leading her on and then using body shaming as a reason to break up, he's responsible for not being clear about his feelings and making a cruel comment. The author's reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling manipulated and hurt. However, her response of spamming him and using aggressive language could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of his comments.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Aaron's comment about her weight is definitely problematic, but the author's response, while understandable in terms of hurt feelings, might not be the healthiest way to handle it. So, depending on the perspective, the author might be in the wrong for her reaction, but it's not entirely clear. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that she did take it out on him publicly and aggressively, even if he was wrong, her actions might be seen as making her the asshole here. But some might argue that she was justified in her anger. However, the act of spamming him with memes and calling him names could be seen as the wrong action.\n"
