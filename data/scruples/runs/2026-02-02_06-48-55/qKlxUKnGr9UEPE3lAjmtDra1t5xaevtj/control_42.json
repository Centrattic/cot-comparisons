I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a flirty, dating-like relationship with their friend Aaron. When the author tried to take things further, Aaron said he's only happy being friends and then made a comment about girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, and he confirmed it. Then the author called him out and started spamming him with memes. Aaron got angry and said the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron's comment about girls who don't work out sounds like a backhanded way of saying he's not attracted to the author because of their weight. Making someone feel bad for their body is generally considered rude and harmful. It's a form of body shaming, which is not okay. The author was honest and confronted him, which is a valid response. However, the author then started spamming him with memes, which could be seen as retaliatory and maybe a bit harsh. But given that the author was hurt and felt led on, their reaction might be understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron admitting attraction is conditional on someone's weight or fitness level is problematic. Weight is not a valid basis for attraction in a healthy relationship. The author's response, while maybe a bit aggressive with the spam, was about standing up for themselves. The half feeling bad might be because they overreacted a bit, but the core issue is Aaron's comment. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for calling him out, even if their method could be improved. The main problem is Aaron being attracted to them conditionally and making them feel bad, which is on him. Therefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
