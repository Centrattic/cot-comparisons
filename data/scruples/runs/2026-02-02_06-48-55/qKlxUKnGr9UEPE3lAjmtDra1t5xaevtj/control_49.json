I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, quasi-relationship for a few months, with dates and sleeping in the same bed. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron declined and said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a veiled way of saying she's fat. The author confronted him, he confirmed, and she lashed out, leading to him blocking her and calling her an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, to determine who's at fault. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a common way to subtly express size bias or fatphobia, which is a form of discrimination. By saying that, he's implying that the author's weight is a factor in his lack of attraction, which is hurtful and unfair. The author's reaction was to get angry and send memes that criticize his comment, which could be seen as retaliation. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable given that Aaron led her on with flirtatious behavior and then used a discriminatory reason to reject her. However, her response of spamming him with memes might be considered harsh or vindictive. But considering that Aaron made a derogatory comment based on her body, her reaction is a form of standing up for herself. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is Aaron's fatphobic remark, which is clearly wrong. The author's response, while perhaps aggressive, is a reaction to being mistreated. So, the author isn't the one in the wrong here; the fault lies more with Aaron for his discriminatory comment and leading her on. The author's actions are a response to being hurt, so she's not the asshole in this situation.\n"
