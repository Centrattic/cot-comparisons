I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the author and her friend Aaron have been having a flirty, almost dating relationship. Then, when she wants to take it to the next level, he says he's not into relationships and specifically says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. She gets mad, calls him out, and starts spamming him with memes. He then blocks her but tells her she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is confused because she feels like she did the right thing but also feels a bit bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is the asshole here. Let's break down the key points. Aaron led her on by being flirty and having dates, making her think there's a real relationship. Then, when she wants to commit, he backs out and uses a body-shaming comment as an excuse. The author confronts him, which is a valid reaction to being rejected with such a remark. She calls him out for being a jerk, which is understandable because his comment was hurtful. Then she sends memes that are mocking his comment, which might be seen as aggressive, but given the context, it's a response to his hurtful words.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. The user is asking if her reaction was wrong. On one hand, she was wronged by Aaron's comment and had the right to express her hurt. On the other hand, spamming him with memes could be seen as harassment, even if it's in retaliation. However, considering that Aaron had been leading her on and used a derogatory comment, her response is a justified reaction to being mistreated. The key point is that Aaron was the one who made a harmful comment, and the author was defending herself against that. So, the author isn't the asshole here because she was responding to someone who wronged her first. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
