I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who led the author on by being flirty, going on dates, and sleeping together, but then rejected her romantic advances. The key here is that after the rejection, the author confronted Aaron and learned that his reason for not being interested was because she doesn't work out, implying he's not attracted to women who are fat. The author then responded by calling him a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes, leading to a back-and-forth where Aaron claims she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author felt led on, which is a valid feeling. If Aaron was being flirty and engaging in behaviors that suggest a romantic or physical relationship, then not following through can be leading someone on. That's generally considered inconsiderate. However, the author's response was to lash out and spam him with memes, which could be seen as aggressive or hurtful. The question is whether her reaction was justified.\n\nOn Aaron's side, he admitted that he's not attracted to women who don't work out, which the author took as a comment on her weight. While people have preferences, making someone feel bad for their body image can be hurtful. However, the author's response of calling him names and spamming might have been an overreaction. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: Leading someone on is problematic. If Aaron didn't have romantic intentions but engaged in behaviors that suggested he did, he's partly responsible. The author was hurt and her reaction, while perhaps harsh, might be a result of feeling betrayed. However, the way she responded\u2014spamming him and using aggressive language\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, even if justified in her mind. The line between standing up for oneself and being inconsiderate can be thin here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at her actions\u2014calling him names and spamming\u2014those could be seen as inconsiderate. But if we consider that he led her on, her reaction might be understandable. However, the key point is whether her actions were wrong. The author had the right to express her feelings, but the method of doing so (spamming and harsh words) could be problematic. On the other hand, if Aaron's comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is a harmful double standard or body-shaming, then the author's response might be more about defending herself against his hurtful comment. \n\nIn many cases, both parties might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she was the one who escalated the situation with her response, even if hurt, it's possible she's at fault. However, if Aaron's comment was particularly hurtful, her reaction might be seen as a justified expression of her hurt. \n\nThe answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because she was standing up for herself against someone who led her on and made a hurtful comment. However, the method of her response might be questionable. But the core issue is Aaron's actions leading her on and the body-shaming comment. The author's reaction, while perhaps not ideal, is a response to being treated poorly. So, the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
