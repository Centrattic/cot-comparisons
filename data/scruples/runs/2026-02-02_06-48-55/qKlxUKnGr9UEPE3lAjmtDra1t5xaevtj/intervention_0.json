I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend, Aaron, who tells the author they're his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as meaning fat girls. They had a flirty, dating-like relationship, but when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he's just not into relationships and specifically mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out. The author confronts him, calls him a piece of shit, and then starts spamming him with memes. Aaron says the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: he led the author on with physical intimacy and flirty behavior, implying a romantic relationship but then pulled back when the author wanted commitment. That's a classic case of leading someone on. When the author confronted him, he used a fat-shaming comment as an excuse. That's definitely not okay. However, when the author responded by calling him names and spamming him with memes, which are likely mocking his fat-shaming, that could be seen as a harsh reaction. The author's actions were direct and confrontational, which might be justified given Aaron's behavior, but maybe a bit over the top. \n\nNow, Aaron's response was to call the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" That's problematic because Aaron made a harmful comment, and he's the one who should feel bad for his fat-shaming. The author was defending themselves against that harmful statement. However, the spamming memes might have crossed a line in terms of harassment, even if it's in response to being mistreated. \n\nThe key points here are: Aaron led the author on, used a fat-shaming excuse, and then took the author's confrontation as an attack on his preferences, which are indeed harmful. The author's reaction, while maybe aggressive, is in response to being disrespected and mistreated. So, while the author's actions might not be the most appropriate, the main fault lies with Aaron for his behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
