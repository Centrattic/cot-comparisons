I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a close, flirty relationship with their friend Aaron. They went on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't interested in a relationship. The key part is when Aaron told the author he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on their weight. The author then reacts by telling Aaron off, spamming him with memes, and calling him names.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author feels led on because Aaron had a close, flirty relationship but then rejected them. The author was hurt and expressed their frustration, which included calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes. Aaron, in turn, said the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overreacted. The author's actions (spamming, name-calling) might be seen as aggressive. However, the initial hurt from being rejected after a potentially misleading situation could justify some reaction. The line in the sand is whether the author's response was proportionate. Calling someone a \"piece of shit\" and spamming them could be seen as crossing into unkind behavior, even if hurt or angry. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a fat-shaming remark, is problematic. Aaron's statement might be considered discriminatory or disrespectful towards the author's body, which the author is reacting to. The author might feel justified in pointing out the insensitivity of Aaron's remark.\n\nBut the author's method of expressing their hurt\u2014spamming with memes and using strong language\u2014could be seen as unprofessional or cruel, even if they felt wronged. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to being rejected and fat-shamed. If the author's response was to call Aaron a name and spam him, that's not a healthy or constructive way to handle the situation, which could place the blame on the author for overreacting. However, if Aaron made a fat-shaming comment, the author might feel justified in confronting him, though the method could be questioned.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for their harsh response, even if Aaron's comment was hurtful. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and unkind. However, there's nuance because Aaron's initial comment was problematic. The author's reaction might be an overreaction, so they could be at fault here. Alternatively, if Aaron was indeed being discriminatory, the author might have a point in calling him out, but the way they did it might not be appropriate. The balance here is tricky. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response was proportionate. Since the author called Aaron names and spammed him, which is not a healthy way to handle the situation, they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
