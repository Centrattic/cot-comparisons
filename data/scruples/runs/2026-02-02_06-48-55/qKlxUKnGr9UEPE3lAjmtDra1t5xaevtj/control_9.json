I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Aaron and the author having a complicated relationship. They were friends but had a lot of flirting and dates, which the author thought was leading somewhere more romantic. Then Aaron basically told her he's happy just being friends and not into a relationship. The key point is when Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. She confronts him, he confirms it, and she gets really angry, starts spamming him with memes about body size, and ends up making him feel bad. He calls her an asshole for making him feel like that and blocks her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is the asshole here. Let's break it down. First, Aaron told her he's not into a relationship, then made a comment about her not working out, which she took as being about her weight. She's upset because he led her on, and she feels hurt. Her response was to spam him with memes and call him names. He responds by calling her an asshole and blocking her. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a few angles. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment based on weight, which is a sensitive and often hurtful issue. The author has every right to be angry and express her feelings, especially after feeling led on. She's standing up for herself and her body, which is valid. The memes she used might be seen as a way to assert her self-worth in the face of his judgment, which is a common reaction in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, her response was to spam him with messages and call him names. While she was hurt, the public nature of the spam (Facebook) and the aggressive tone might be seen as crossing a line. However, considering the context\u2014he made a personal and hurtful comment about her body\u2014it's also about the violation of trust and emotional manipulation. If he was leading her on and then used her weight as an excuse, her anger is justified. \n\nThe key here is whether her reaction was proportionate. She was hurt, and he made a derogatory comment. Calling him names and spamming him could be seen as venting, but in a public forum. However, given that he made a personal attack, her response might be a form of self-advocacy. The line between justified anger and being an asshole is thin, but in this case, if he was the one who made the hurtful comment, her reaction is understandable. \n\nAlso, the fact that he told her he's not attracted to girls who don't work out\u2014code for fat girls\u2014highlights his bias. The author's response is about challenging that bias and defending herself. While public shaming can be problematic, in this context, she's responding to personal hurt. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because he initiated the hurtful comment. \n\nAnother angle: if someone makes a discriminatory remark, it's not the victim's fault for reacting negatively. So, if Aaron said something about her weight, her being upset and standing up for herself isn't the fault. The problem lies with Aaron's comment. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
