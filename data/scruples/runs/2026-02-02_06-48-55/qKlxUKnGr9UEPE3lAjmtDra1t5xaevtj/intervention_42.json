I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. They provided their own thoughts, thinking the author might be at fault but are unsure.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The author is in a situation where they had a close relationship with Aaron, which they considered more than friends. When the author wanted to take things further, Aaron rejected them, stating he wasn't into relationships and that he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a reference to weight. The author then reacts by calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and sending memes about body size. Aaron, in turn, blocks the author and calls them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe user is divided, feeling both bad and thinking they said what needed to be said. Now, to determine if the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at Aaron's actions: He led the author on by engaging in flirty behavior and dates, which could be seen as leading someone on. When confronted, he made a comment that's hurtful and possibly discriminatory (using \"don't work out\" as a code for fat), which is problematic. The author's response was to confront Aaron and express their hurt, which is a valid reaction. However, spamming Aaron with memes might be excessive, but it's a reaction to being insulted.\n\nThe key points here are consent, honesty, and respect. Aaron didn't clarify his feelings until the author pressed him, and his comment about not being attracted to certain body types is a judgment. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh (spamming), is a response to being dismissed and insulted. However, the author did confront Aaron directly and express their feelings, which is the right approach. The author's anger is justified given Aaron's insensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's right to his preferences isn't in question, but how he communicated it and the context of leading on the author matters. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves after being hurt. So the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
