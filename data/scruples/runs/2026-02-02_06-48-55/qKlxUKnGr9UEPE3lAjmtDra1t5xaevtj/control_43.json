I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author had a friend named Aaron, and they were in a flirty situation, going on dates and even sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were more than friends. Then, the author tried to take things to the next level, and Aaron said he was happy just being friends. The author felt led on and pushed further, and Aaron then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, he admitted it meant that, and the author got angry, called him out, and started sending memes about body size. Aaron said the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and blocked them. The author feels conflicted: half bad but also thinks they said what needed to be said.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. So I need to look at both sides.\n\nFirst, Aaron's actions. He had a friendly/flirty relationship, led the author on with dates and physical closeness, then rejected her, giving a reason that's clearly weight-based. The author felt hurt and tried to get a straight answer, which Aaron gave. The author's response was to call him out and send memes, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational. But Aaron made a comment that was hurtful and possibly discriminatory. The author might feel justified in expressing their anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was spamming Aaron with memes after he had already left. That could be seen as overreacting or not respecting Aaron's decision to end things. Also, calling him a \"piece of shit\" is pretty harsh. However, the initial comment from Aaron about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a form of body shaming. The author was standing up for themselves after being led on and then rejected with a prejudiced reason.\n\nSo, who's at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If Aaron made a discriminatory remark, the author has a right to be upset. However, the author's response might have been aggressive, but given the context, maybe it's understandable. The key points are Aaron's body-shaming comment and the author's reaction to being led on. The main issue is that Aaron was disrespectful and discriminatory, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The answer might be B (No), because the author was defending themselves against harmful comments, even if their response was a bit harsh. But maybe there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the author's reaction was unwarranted, then A (Yes). But I think the main fault lies with Aaron for his discriminatory remark. The author's reaction is a response to that, so they're not the asshole.\n"
