I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a friend named Aaron who told the author he considers her his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a reference to her weight. The situation escalates with hurtful comments and social media spam.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was led on by Aaron, who engaged in flirty behavior and went on dates with her. When the author wanted to take things further, Aaron backed out and made a comment about her weight. The author took offense, confronted him, and then spammed his social media with memes about body size. Aaron responded by calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, who's at fault here? On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a veiled insult about her weight, which is hurtful and discriminatory. Leading someone on with flirtatious behavior and then using their body as a reason to reject them is not okay. That's a form of emotional manipulation and disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to spam Aaron with memes that could be seen as attacking his character or views. While he made a hurtful comment, the author's retaliation with social media posts might be excessive. However, considering the emotional context\u2014being rejected after being led on\u2014her reaction could be seen as a justified expression of hurt and anger. But spamming someone with memes, even if they're humorous, can be seen as harassment or an attempt to publicly shame them, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. I need to weigh the actions. Aaron's behavior was the initial wrongdoing by being inconsiderate and using weight as a reason for rejection. The author's response, while hurtful, was a reaction to being mistreated. However, publicly shaming someone on social media isn't constructive and could be seen as part of the problem. But given that Aaron dismissed her feelings and made a discriminatory comment, her frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. If she had a right to be upset about being rejected based on her body, then her reaction might be a form of self-advocacy. However, spamming someone's social media is not a healthy way to handle it. So maybe the author is partly at fault for the escalation, but Aaron is definitely wrong for his initial comment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her response was proportionate. Since Aaron's actions were inexcusable, the author's anger is valid, but her method of expressing it might be inappropriate. However, in online contexts, people often use humor to cope, and the memes could be a form of venting rather than harassment. But spamming could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlternatively, the author's actions might be justified given the emotional harm caused. The line between justified anger and being in the wrong is thin here. Since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the context, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Aaron's comment was wrong, then the author's reaction, while perhaps not the best approach, isn't necessarily her fault. The answer might be B.\n"
