I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend (or maybe more than a friend) who said they find the author attractive enough to consider as an ideal girlfriend but then later said they aren't into girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a euphemism for fat girls. The author is upset because they felt led on, and after being rejected, they spammed the person with memes and then confronted them, leading to the person saying the author made them feel bad for their \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy, Aaron, had a flirty friendship with the author, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. When the author wanted to take it further, he rejected her, citing that he's not into girls who don't work out. The author took this as a comment on her weight. Then, she spammed his Facebook with memes related to body positivity and fat-shaming. He responded by saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" and she's now questioning if she was wrong to be angry.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was in the wrong for confronting Aaron and publicly shaming him on social media for making a comment that she interpreted as fat-shaming. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as fat-shaming, especially since \"don't work out\" might imply being overweight. The author has the right to be upset if she felt led on and then rejected based on her body. On the other hand, the author's response of spamming his Facebook with memes and using public shaming could be considered harsh or inappropriate, even if she's hurt.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. Is it okay for someone to be angry and express it publicly, or is that over the line? Also, is Aaron's comment inherently wrong, or is it about personal preferences?\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but sometimes people make comments that can be hurtful. If Aaron was indeed leading her on and then rejected her with a comment that could be seen as discriminatory, the author has a valid grievance. However, the way she responded\u2014spamming Facebook with memes\u2014might come off as aggressive or disrespectful, even if she's upset. Public shaming can escalate conflicts and isn't always the healthiest way to address issues.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions were a justified response. While she was hurt and felt disrespected, her method of expressing that (publicly) might not be the best approach. However, the initial comment from Aaron about not being into girls who don't work out is problematic, especially if he was in a flirty, close relationship with her. It's possible he was being hypocritical or inconsistent.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as a justified reaction to being led on and then rejected based on her body, but her method of response (public shaming) could be considered excessive or unkind. However, societal attitudes are shifting towards supporting people who speak out against fat-shaming. So, there's a balance here. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal opinions on how to handle such situations.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If I think the author's actions were a reasonable response to being fat-shamed and feeling led on, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). If the author overreacted, then A (in the wrong). Given that the author took the comment as fat-shaming and was upset about being led on, her reaction is understandable, even if the method of response was not ideal. However, the question is about being the \"asshole,\" which often relates to moral judgment. If the person being criticized (Aaron) was the one making the discriminatory comment, then the author isn't the asshole for responding angrily. But if the author's public shaming was uncalled for, maybe she is. It's a bit of a tightrope. \n\nIn many cases, people who are fat-shamed and then respond publicly are often seen as justified, especially if the person making the comment was in a close relationship. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I have to evaluate based on the details.\n"
