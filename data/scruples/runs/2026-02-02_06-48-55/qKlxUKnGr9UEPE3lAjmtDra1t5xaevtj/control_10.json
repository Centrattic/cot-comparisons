I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who had a flirty, almost dating relationship with the author. They were on dates, slept in the same bed, etc., but when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron backed out, saying he's not into relationships with girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a comment on her weight. The author then called Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spammed his social media with memes related to body positivity. Aaron responded by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and then blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overreacted. Aaron's statement about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a polite way of avoiding a direct comment on her weight, which might be considered a sensitive topic. The author took it directly as a fat-shaming comment, which is valid because body shaming is wrong. However, the way she responded\u2014calling him a name and spamming his accounts\u2014might be excessive. While it's understandable to feel hurt, the author's actions could be seen as aggressive and hurtful, even if justified by the initial comment. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. Aaron might not have intended to body shame, but the author's interpretation is reasonable. The author's half-feel bad suggests some self-awareness, but the actions still crossed a line. So, there's a mix of right and wrong here. However, the main issue is that the author's response was not appropriate, even if the initial comment was hurtful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the aggressive retaliation, even if motivated by valid feelings.\n"
