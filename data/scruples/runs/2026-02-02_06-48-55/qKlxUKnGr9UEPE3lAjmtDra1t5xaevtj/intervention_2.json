I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves the author and their friend Aaron. They've been in a flirty, almost dating situation for months, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. Then the author wants to take things further, but Aaron says he's only happy being friends. The author argues, and he says he's not into relationships with women who don't work out, which comes across as fat-shaming. The author confronts him about it, leading to an argument. The author then spams him with memes related to body positivity, and Aaron claims she made him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. Aaron told the friend he's his ideal girlfriend but then immediately said he's not into girls who don't work out, implying that she's fat. That's a problem because he led her on by being flirty and treating it like a potential relationship but then rejected her based on her body, which is fat-shaming. The author was upset and confronted him, leading to an argument. Then she spammed him with memes. He called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the author's actions: She confronted him when he made a hurtful comment about her weight. She expressed her feelings, which is reasonable. However, after he left, she spammed him with memes, which might be seen as aggressive. But the initial comment from Aaron was the main issue. He was being discriminatory and then criticized her for calling him out.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault: Aaron made the hurtful comment, leading her to defend herself. Her response, while perhaps harsh (spamming), was a reaction to his fat-shaming. However, his statement about \"natural desires\" might be excusing prejudice, which is problematic. The author's actions were a reaction to being disrespected. The question is whether her response was justified. She had a right to feel hurt and to challenge his comments. However, spamming could be seen as overreacting. But given that he led her on and then made a discriminatory remark, her response is understandable. The key is whether her actions crossed a line. The answer hinges on whether his comment was more offensive than her response. Since he made the initial hurtful remark, and her reaction was to call him out, even if it was aggressive, the main fault lies with him. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
