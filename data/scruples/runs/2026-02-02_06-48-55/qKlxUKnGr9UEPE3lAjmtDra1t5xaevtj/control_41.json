I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who is leading the author on with flirtatious behavior and dates, then when the author wants to take it further, he says he's not into relationships and that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author reacts angrily, calls him out, and then spams him with memes. He responds by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and she's conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron were in a close, flirty relationship that the author considered more than friends. When she wanted to commit, he backed out. Then he made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as fat-shaming. She confronted him, called him out, and then bombarded him with messages. He then told her she was an asshole for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was led on by Aaron, and his comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a negative comment on her body, which is hurtful. His behavior\u2014flirting, leading her on, then making a derogatory comment\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The author's reaction was to confront him and express her anger, which is understandable. However, she then spammed him with memes, which might be seen as aggressive or harassing.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be a personal preference, but it's offensive when directed at someone's weight. The author's response of calling him out for making her feel like he's fat-shaming is valid. However, her subsequent spamming of him with memes might be excessive, even if her initial confrontation was justified.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped in her response. Confronting him about the hurtful comment is reasonable. But spamming him with messages, especially after he's already left, could be seen as harassment. However, given the context that he led her on and made a derogatory comment, her anger is justified. The line between defending oneself and being an asshole can be thin here. \n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if she's the asshole. The answer depends on whether her actions were proportionate. Confronting someone about a hurtful comment is not the issue. The problem might be the spamming. But in the context of being led on and then fat-shamed, her reaction could be seen as a justified stand. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the spamming was excessive, that could tip the scales. However, considering the emotional context and that he had been leading her on, her response might be understandable. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong), but I need to check if her actions cross into harassment. The initial confrontation is okay, but the spamming could be problematic. However, given the circumstances, her anger and desire to stand up for herself are valid. The answer is B.\n"
