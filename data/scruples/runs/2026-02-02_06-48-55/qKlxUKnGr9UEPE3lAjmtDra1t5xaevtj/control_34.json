I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their friend Aaron. They've been in a flirty, date-like relationship, and the author wanted to take it further. Aaron said he's not into relationships and isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then responds strongly, calling Aaron a piece of shit and spamming him with memes. Aaron says the author made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is unsure if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron led the author on by being flirty and going on dates, which might have given the author the impression that there was a possibility of a relationship. Then, when the author wants to move forward, Aaron rejects them and uses a comment that's clearly about the author's weight. That's pretty hurtful and seems like a backhanded way to reject someone. The author's reaction is to express anger and send memes that are critical of Aaron's comment. The author is justified in feeling hurt because Aaron's comment was not only a rejection but also a personal attack on their body.\n\nHowever, the author's response of spamming Aaron's Facebook with memes could be seen as aggressive. While Aaron's comment was rude, the author's retaliation might be over the top. But considering the context of being led on and then being insulted, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. The key point is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. The author is asserting their worth and calling out Aaron's hypocrisy or insensitivity, which is reasonable. On the other hand, public shaming via social media could be seen as harsh. However, given that Aaron used a body-shaming remark, the author's memes might be seen as a justified form of self-advocacy rather than just making him feel bad for his beliefs. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly the more offensive part. The author's anger is a reaction to being rejected and insulted. Even though the author's response was strong, they were defending themselves against a personal attack. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
