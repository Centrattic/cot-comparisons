I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who made some comments that the author found hurtful. \n\nFirst, Aaron called the author his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. They had been in a flirty, almost dating situation, and when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron pulled back. The author confronted him and got a response that was clearly about her weight, which upset her. She then sent him angry messages and memes, leading to Aaron saying she made him feel like an asshole. \n\nThe author is conflicted: she feels she did the right thing but also feels a bit bad. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. So, Aaron's comments about attraction based on workout habits could be seen as body-shaming, especially since the author points out it's a code for weight. His behavior of leading her on with flirty dates and then pulling back when she pushes for a relationship is definitely problematic. He's not being honest about his reasons, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author, when confronted with this, expresses her anger through spamming him with memes. That's aggressive and might be considered harsh. But considering the context\u2014being led on and then being told she's not attractive because of her weight\u2014her reaction is understandable. The question is whether her response was justified. \n\nIf Aaron's behavior was the root issue, then the author is reacting to his hurtful remarks. However, spamming someone with memes, even if it's in response to being treated poorly, could be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, Aaron also said she made him feel like an asshole, which is a bit of a cop-out because he was the one who made the hurtful comment. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who acted inconsiderately or unkindly. The author was hurt and expressed her feelings in a way that might be seen as retaliatory, but the initial wrongdoing was Aaron's. However, the author's response might not be entirely without fault. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that Aaron led her on and then made a hurtful comment about her body, the author's anger is justified. Her response, while perhaps aggressive, is a reaction to his actions. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
