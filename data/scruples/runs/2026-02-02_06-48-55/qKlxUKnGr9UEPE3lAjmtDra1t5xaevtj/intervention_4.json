I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend named Aaron who had a flirty, almost romantic relationship with the author. The key points are that Aaron told the author he would be her ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as code for fat girls. Then, when the author confronts him, he says he's not into a relationship and implies the author is fat. The author then calls him names and spams his Facebook with memes, and Aaron blocks her and calls her an asshole.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. The task is to answer A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, author is not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. Aaron's actions: he led the author on with flirty behavior, dates, and sleeping together. Then, when confronted, he dismisses her feelings and uses a backhanded compliment that's actually an insult. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a veiled insult about her weight, which is hurtful and disrespectful. \n\nThe author's reaction is to confront him directly, express her anger, and then send memes that are related to body positivity. While spamming someone with messages can be seen as aggressive, the context is that Aaron made a derogatory comment about her body. The author's response is a defensive reaction to being insulted. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Aaron's behavior is problematic because he led her on and then used a hurtful comment to reject her. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most constructive, is a response to being treated disrespectfully. However, spamming someone with messages after being blocked could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut considering that Aaron's comment was a direct insult, the author's anger is justified. The memes she used are about body positivity, which align with the issue at hand. The key here is whether the author's response was disproportionately harsh. \n\nOn one hand, spamming with memes might not be the best way to handle it. On the other, she was defending herself against a derogatory remark. The question is whether her actions make her the asshole. \n\nI think the main issue is Aaron's behavior. He was in the wrong for using a backhanded insult and leading her on. The author was justified in feeling hurt and responding, but her method of spamming might not be the best approach. However, given that he called her fat in a dismissive way, her anger is valid. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the primary fault lies with Aaron. The author's response, while perhaps not the most mature, is a reaction to being insulted. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B. I think the answer is B (No) because Aaron was the one who made the hurtful comment, and the author's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is understandable given the context. The author isn't entirely at fault here. So the answer is B.\n"
