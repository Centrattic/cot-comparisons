I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl who had a flirty, almost romantic relationship with her friend Aaron. He told her he's her ideal girlfriend but then said he's not into girls who don't work out, which is code for fat girls. She was hurt, called him out, and then started spamming him with memes. He left her Facebook, and she's now wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Aaron led her on by being flirty, going on dates, and sleeping together, which makes her feel like they were more than friends. Then, when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her and implied she's fat. She confronted him, he admitted it, and she called him out. Then she spammed him with memes, which he found offensive and blocked her. He said she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires,\" and she's conflicted about whether she was right to respond that way.\n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron was disrespectful by using weight as a reason for rejecting her. That's hurtful and discriminatory. On the other hand, the author responded by spamming him with memes, which could be seen as attacking his character and mocking his views. While his comments were offensive, her response might be excessive, especially if she continued after he had already admitted his mistake. However, given that he was dismissive of her feelings and called his actions \"natural desires,\" her reaction could be a justified expression of hurt and frustration.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she was responding to his hurtful remarks, then maybe not. However, spamming someone with memes after they've already addressed the issue might be seen as crossing a line. The line here is between expressing valid anger and being an asshole by continuing the conflict in a disrespectful way.\n\nWeight-based discrimination is a serious issue, and calling someone out for that isn't inherently wrong. But her method of response\u2014spamming\u2014might be problematic. However, if she was genuinely hurt and he dismissed her feelings, her reaction could be seen as a defense mechanism. \n\nSo, is she wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether her response was proportionate. If he was making a derogatory comment and she's standing up for herself, maybe not. But if she's escalating the conflict unnecessarily, maybe. However, the context of being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming comment adds to the emotional complexity. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She was defending herself against a hurtful remark, and while her method could be improved, the core issue is Aaron's behavior. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
