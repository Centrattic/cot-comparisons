I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they confronted a friend, Aaron, who led them on but then criticized their weight. \n\nFirst, Aaron claimed they were just friends but had a flirty dynamic, dates, and even slept together. That suggests he might have been leading her on. Then, when she wanted to take it further, he said he's happy with being friends and isn't into girls who don't work out, which she interpreted as a jab at her weight. She confronts him, he confirms it's about her being fat, she gets angry and calls him out, leading to a back-and-forth where he says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The key points are whether Aaron was in the wrong for leading her on and making a comment about her weight, and if the author's response was appropriate. \n\nFrom what's described, Aaron's actions seem to be the main issue. He engaged in a flirty, physical relationship but then rejected her based on her body, which is clearly discriminatory and hurtful. The author's response is defensive and confrontational, which could be seen as justified given the betrayal and disrespect. \n\nHowever, spamming him with memes was probably not the best approach. But considering the context, the author was reacting to being led on and then criticized. So while the method might be questionable, the underlying issue is Aaron's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
