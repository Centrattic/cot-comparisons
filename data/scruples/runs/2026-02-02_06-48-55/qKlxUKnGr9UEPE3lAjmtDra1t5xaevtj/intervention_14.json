I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend, Aaron, made some hurtful comments. The author and Aaron had a relationship that was more than just friends, with flirty behavior and dates. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship and specifically mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author got angry, called him a \"piece of shit,\" and then spammed his Facebook with memes related to body acceptance. Aaron responded by calling the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted about whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. **Aaron's Behavior**: He led the author on by having a flirty, date-like relationship without being clear about his feelings. Then, when asked to clarify, he made a derogatory comment about her body type. This is problematic because he was using the friend's feelings to his advantage and then made a hurtful comment. Leading someone on and then being disrespectful is generally considered wrong.\n\n2. **Author's Reaction**: The author was hurt and angry. She expressed her feelings by calling him names and spamming his Facebook with memes. While it's understandable to be upset, using spam and harsh language might be seen as overreacting. However, given the context of being led on and then insulted, her reaction could be seen as a justified emotional response. The memes she sent are about body acceptance, which is a valid message, but the method (spamming) might be excessive.\n\n3. **Mutual Accountability**: Both parties have some responsibility here. Aaron led on and made a hurtful comment, which is definitely inconsiderate. The author's response, while not the best approach, stems from being hurt. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was the one who took the action (spamming, harsh words), but Aaron initiated the emotional manipulation and insult, the fault isn't entirely on her.\n\n4. **Context of the Relationship**: The relationship was more than friends, so Aaron's decision to end it without being upfront and then making a derogatory comment is worse. The author's reaction, though not ideal, is a reaction to being mistreated. \n\nConsidering all these factors, while the author could have handled her anger in a more constructive way, the primary fault lies with Aaron for leading her on and making the hurtful comment. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but the question is whether she is \"in the wrong.\" Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), and the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure, the correct answer here would be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, this is a nuanced situation where both have some responsibility, but the main issue is Aaron's behavior.\n"
