I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation with their friend Aaron. The key points are that Aaron told the author he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which is code for fat girls, and the author felt led on because they thought their relationship was more than friends. \n\nFirst, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment about the author's body. The author directly asks if he means because she's fat, and he confirms it. That's a pretty clear case of size discrimination, which is a form of prejudice and can be hurtful. \n\nThen, the author responds by spamming his Facebook with memes from bloggers about size, which is a way to express her hurt and anger. Aaron then blocks her and calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, Aaron initiated the hurt by making a comment that was discriminatory. The author's reaction, while maybe aggressive, comes from being hurt and standing up for herself. However, spamming someone's Facebook might be seen as overreacting, depending on how it's done. But the main issue is Aaron's inappropriate comment. The author isn't wrong for standing up for herself, even if her response was harsh. The problem is more on Aaron's side for the sizeist remark and leading her on. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
