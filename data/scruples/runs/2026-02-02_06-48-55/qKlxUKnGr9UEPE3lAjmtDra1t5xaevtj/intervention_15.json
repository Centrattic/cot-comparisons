I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who the author was having a flirty, almost dating relationship with. They spent time together, went on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. Then, when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he was just happy being friends and wasn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a comment on her weight.\n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty in relationships. Aaron led the author on by maintaining a flirty, intimate relationship without clear boundaries. When the author made a move, he rejected her, but his reasoning was a bit underhanded, using a vague comment about working out as a euphemism for her weight. The author then reacted strongly, called him out, and spammed him with memes, leading to a confrontation where Aaron felt insulted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Aaron's behavior was leading her on, which is dishonest. He didn't clearly communicate his feelings until she made a move, which is manipulative. On the other hand, the author's reaction might have been harsh. She did call him out for his comment about weight, which is a valid issue, but the way she handled it (spamming him with memes) could be seen as aggressive. However, considering that Aaron had been leading her on, her frustration is understandable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The main issue is Aaron's dishonesty and making a comment that could be seen as body-shaming. The author's reaction, while perhaps excessive, was a response to being led on and then insulted. In terms of who is the asshole, the question is whether the author acted unreasonably. Since Aaron was the one who made the hurtful comment and led her on, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
