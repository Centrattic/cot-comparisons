I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their friend Aaron had a relationship that was more than just friends, with flirting and dates. The author wanted to take it to the next level, but Aaron said he's not interested in a relationship. He mentioned he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for being fat. The author confronts him, and after a back-and-forth, the author starts spamming Aaron with memes and eventually blocks him. Aaron then calls the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior. He was in a situation where there was a lot of flirting and dates, leading the author to believe there was a romantic interest. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron rejected them, giving a reason that seems to be a bit of a backhanded compliment. Saying he's not into girls who don't work out might imply body-shaming, which is hurtful. The author was direct in pointing that out, which could be justified. But then the author starts spamming him with memes, which is aggressive and possibly hurtful. The line \"if you can't handle my size...\" is a meme that's often used to confront body-shamers, but spamming someone with memes after they've rejected you might be excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's response of calling the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his desires is problematic. If his comment about not being into girls who don't work out is a form of prejudice or bias, then the author has a right to be upset. However, the author's response of spamming and blocking might be seen as retaliatory. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and how each handled the situation. Aaron led the author on with flirtatious behavior and then rejected them with a comment that could be seen as offensive. The author confronted him and then escalated by spamming. While the author's actions were in response to being hurt and feeling used, the method of response might be seen as the problem. However, the initial issue is that Aaron made a derogatory comment, which the author is justified in addressing. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for confronting Aaron's comment, but their method of retaliation (spamming) could be seen as an asshole move. However, the main issue here is Aaron's insensitivity and leading the author on. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from being hurt. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. Maybe the answer is B (No) because the author's actions were a reaction to being hurt and confronted a harmful comment, even if their method wasn't the best.\n"
