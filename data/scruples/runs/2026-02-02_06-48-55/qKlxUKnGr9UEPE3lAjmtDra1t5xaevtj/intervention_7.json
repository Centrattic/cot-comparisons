I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who told the author he's not interested in a relationship because she doesn't work out, implying he's not attracted to fat girls. The author responded by calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes, leading to Aaron saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt led on by Aaron, who engaged in flirty behavior and dates but then rejected her when she wanted a relationship. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a fat-shaming remark. That's a problem because it's discriminatory to base attraction solely on body type, especially when it's tied to a health-related activity like working out.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to spam Aaron with memes and call him names. While Aaron's comment was hurtful, the author's actions of harassment (spamming) are inappropriate regardless of the situation. The author's reaction might be justified in feeling hurt, but responding with aggressive behavior can also be harmful. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their response.\n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment was definitely wrong. On the other, the author's response was confrontational and possibly harassing. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to being fat-shamed. However, even if the initial comment was wrong, the author's actions could still be considered in the wrong if they crossed the line into harassment. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance.\n\nIn some contexts, standing up against fat-shaming is commendable, but the method here was spamming and name-calling, which might not be the best approach. The author might be justified in feeling angry but not in how they expressed it. Alternatively, if the author was defending herself against a harmful comment, her reaction could be seen as defending her self-worth. But spamming someone with memes is more about public shaming, which complicates things.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportionate. While Aaron's comment was deplorable, the author's actions could be seen as retaliatory in a way that's also inappropriate. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for her response, even if Aaron's initial comment was wrong. The question is whether the user thinks the author is in the wrong, and based on the options given (A for yes, B for no), the answer might be A. But I need to be careful here.\n"
