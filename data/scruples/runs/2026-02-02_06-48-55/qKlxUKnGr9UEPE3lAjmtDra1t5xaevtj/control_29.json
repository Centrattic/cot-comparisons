I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who made a comment about the author not being attractive because she doesn't work out, which the author interprets as a veiled way of saying she's fat. The key points here are about honesty, consent, and how both parties handled the situation.\n\nFirst, Aaron and the author were in a flirty, almost dating situation. He led her on with actions like going on dates and sleeping in the same bed, which could imply a romantic relationship. Then, when she wants to take it further, he backs out and says he's not into her because she doesn't work out. That seems like a double standard or a way to avoid hurting her feelings without being straightforward. The author confronts him, he's honest (though maybe not kindly) about his attraction preferences, and she reacts strongly by calling him out and spamming him with memes. He then blocks her and accuses her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, Aaron was leading her on, and when she expresses her feelings, he makes a judgment based on her body. That's hurtful, and the author has every right to be upset. On the other hand, her reaction\u2014spamming him with memes and being aggressive\u2014might be seen as harsh, even if she's justified in her anger. But considering that Aaron was the one who led her on and then made a derogatory comment, the author's reaction could be a valid expression of her hurt and anger. The story seems to highlight issues of respect and honesty in relationships. Since Aaron was the one who created the ambiguity and then made a comment about her body, the author's actions might be defensible. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
