I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario involves a friend named Aaron who told the author that she's his ideal girlfriend but then followed up with a comment implying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a jab at her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, quasi-dating relationship. When the author wants to take things further, Aaron backs out, citing a lack of attraction tied to not working out. The author confronts him directly, and he admits it's about her weight. She responds angrily, sending memes about body size and calling him a jerk. He retaliates by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and blocks her.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about the perspective. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a sensitive topic. If he led the author on by flirting and creating a romantic atmosphere, then pulling back with a comment about her body, that's a problem. The author's reaction\u2014calling him out and expressing frustration\u2014could be seen as justified if she felt disrespected or led on. However, sending memes that are potentially hurtful might escalate the situation. On the other hand, Aaron's comment about \"natural desires\" could be seen as making excuses for his judgment.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. If Aaron's comment was hurtful and dismissive, then the author's response might be a valid reaction to being rejected in a demeaning way. However, if she responded with spam messages and aggressive memes, that could be seen as unreasonable. The line between standing up for oneself and being confrontational is thin here.\n\nAnother angle: if Aaron was being honest about his preferences, does the author have a right to be upset? People often have preferences, but bringing up weight can be particularly sensitive. The author might feel that Aaron was using a backhanded way to reject her, which is hurtful regardless.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might have some responsibility. Aaron for using body-shaming language and leading her on, and the author for responding with spam and aggressive communication. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key is whether her reaction was disproportionate.\n\nI think the author's reaction is understandable given the context of being led on and then rejected with a comment about her weight. However, the method of response\u2014spamming social media with memes\u2014might be crossing a line. That said, the initial rejection from Aaron was inappropriate, and the author is within her rights to express her hurt feelings. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because Aaron's comment was the root issue, and her reaction, while maybe harsh, was a response to being insulted. But others might see it as A, considering the author's response as overly aggressive. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because Aaron's comment was the main problem.\n"
