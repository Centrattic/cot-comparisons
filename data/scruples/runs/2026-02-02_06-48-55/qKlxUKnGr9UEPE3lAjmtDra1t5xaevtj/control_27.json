I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Aaron, who told them they're his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as code for fat girls. They had a flirty, almost romantic relationship, and when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron declined, citing the fitness comment. The author called him out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author felt led on, which is a valid feeling if there were dates and sleepovers. When Aaron said he's not into girls who don't work out, the author took it as a fat-shaming comment. That's a big deal because making someone feel bad about their body is hurtful. The author then confronted Aaron, called him a \"piece of shit,\" and spammed him with memes. Aaron responded by calling the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did express their feelings, which is okay. But how they expressed it\u2014using harsh language and spamming social media\u2014might be crossing a line. However, Aaron's comment was clearly hurtful and discriminatory. The author had the right to be upset and confront the issue. The line between justified anger and overreaction is thin here. The key points are whether Aaron's comment was inconsiderate and if the author's response was reasonable. Since the author was made to feel fat and then dismissed, their reaction, while strong, might be seen as a response to being hurt. On the other hand, name-calling and spamming could be seen as aggressive. But given the context, the author might not be the asshole here because they were defending themselves against a hurtful comment.\n"
