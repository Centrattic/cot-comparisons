I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating kind of relationship. The author wanted to take it to the next level, but Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship and mentioned he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him, calls him a piece of shit, and starts spamming him with memes. Aaron blocks her but says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but thinks she did what needed to be done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron told the author he wasn't interested in a relationship and gave a reason that the author feels is about her weight. That's pretty hurtful, especially if it's true. The author's reaction is to be angry and lash out, which is understandable given the context. People often react emotionally when they feel rejected or insulted.\n\nOn the other hand, the author admits they were in a flirty situation with dates and sleeping together, which could be seen as leading each other on. If Aaron didn't want a relationship but was engaging in these activities, maybe he did lead her on. However, when the author confronted him, he gave a specific reason that hurt her, which she took as a personal attack.\n\nNow, Aaron's response was to call her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" That's interesting because it's possible Aaron was trying to shift the blame. His comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out could be his way of ending the relationship without directly hurting her, or it could be a genuine but hurtful statement. If it's the latter, the author's reaction is justified. However, if Aaron was just trying to end the relationship and the author is now retaliating with spam and harsh words, that's where the issue might lie.\n\nThe key points here are consent in the relationship, the honesty of both parties, and whether the author's response was proportionate. Leading someone on by being flirty and having dates when you don't want a relationship could be seen as inconsiderate. The author felt wronged and responded emotionally, which is human, but whether that makes her the asshole depends on the context. If Aaron was being cruel or discriminatory, the author's anger is valid. But if she took it too far by spamming and attacking him, that's where she might be in the wrong.\n\nI think the main issue is Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a fat-shaming remark. If that's true, then Aaron was the one in the wrong initially. However, the author's reaction of spamming and harsh words could be seen as over the top. The question is whether her response was justified. Since the author felt led on and then insulted, her anger is understandable, but the way she handled it might have been unkind. However, given the context, maybe she had a right to be upset. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were proportionate. If she was already hurt and felt disrespected, then her response could be seen as a natural reaction rather than being in the wrong. So, maybe she's not the asshole here because Aaron's comment was the initial problem, and her reaction, while harsh, was in response to being insulted.\n"
