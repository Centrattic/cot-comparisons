I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to their friend Aaron. \n\nSo the situation is that the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating situation. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship. Then he mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a veiled insult about her weight. \n\nThe author confronted him, and he admitted it was about her being fat. The author then called him a \"piece of shit\" and sent memes about body size. Aaron retaliated by blocking her, calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron made a comment that could be seen as discriminatory or hurtful. He admitted to being biased against people based on their weight. That's not okay. The author's reaction was angry, which is understandable given the context. But did she overstep? She called him names and sent memes, which might be seen as aggressive. However, she was addressing the hurtful comment he made.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's response of calling her an asshole and blocking her might not be justified, but the initial problem was his comment. The author was defending herself against a derogatory remark. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect honesty in relationships, but making a comment about someone's body in a way that's discriminatory is problematic. The author had every right to be upset. While her reaction was strong, it's in response to being insulted. The key issue is that Aaron made the hurtful comment first, and the author was reacting to that. So, while the author's response was harsh, the root cause is Aaron's behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
