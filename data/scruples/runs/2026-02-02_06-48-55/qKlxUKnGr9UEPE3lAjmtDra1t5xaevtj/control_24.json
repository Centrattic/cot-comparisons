I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who led the author on, making her think they were more than friends. He was flirting, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, but then when she wanted a commitment, he rejected her by saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she took as a comment on her weight.\n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior is questionable. Leading someone on by being flirty and having physical closeness, then rejecting them for a superficial reason like weight could be seen as manipulative. The author called him out for being a \"piece of shit,\" which is harsh, but maybe justified given the lead-up. He then called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" That's a bit odd because his comment about not being attracted to non-exercising girls (implying fat girls) is problematic. The author's response with memes about body size is a reaction to his hurtful comment.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Aaron led her on, used a weight-based reason to reject her, and she reacted with frustration. The author's actions were in response to being hurt. While her reaction might be seen as aggressive (spamming him with memes), it's a common reaction to hurt and feeling disrespected. Aaron's excuse of \"natural desires\" is problematic because it's using a personal preference to hurt someone. The author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against a discriminatory comment. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
