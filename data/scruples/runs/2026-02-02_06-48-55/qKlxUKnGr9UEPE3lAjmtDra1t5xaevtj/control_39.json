I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship for a few months. They've been on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron said he's just happy being friends. Then, when the author presses him, Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author calls Aaron out, gets angry, and then starts spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron responds by saying the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and blocks her.\n\nThe author is conflicted: half feels bad but thinks she said what needed to be said. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a judgment about the author's weight. That's clearly hurtful and a form of body shaming. The author had every right to be upset. However, when the author started spamming him with memes, that's where things might tip into being the asshole. Harassment, even if in response to something hurtful, can be problematic. The author was trying to make a point, but using spamming and public mockery (Facebook) might cross a line. \n\nBut wait, Aaron first led her on by being flirty, going on dates, sleeping over, then suddenly saying he's not interested. That's leading someone on, which is on him. So when the author confronts him and tells him off, it's understandable. The spamming part might be excessive, but the initial response to Aaron's comment about weight is justified. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response or if they escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, the author was in a position where she was hurt and wanted to stand up for herself. Body shaming is a serious issue, and calling out the comment is valid. However, using spam and public shaming (Facebook) could be seen as aggressive, even if it's in response. But considering the context that Aaron had been leading her on, maybe her reaction is within the bounds of self-respect.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the main issue is the harassment via spamming. But the initial confrontation was a valid response to being body-shamed. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be that she's not the asshole because Aaron's behavior was the real problem. But some might argue that her response crossed a line. But considering the context of being led on and then body-shamed, her actions were a reaction to his inappropriate comments. The harassment could be seen as her way of defending herself, even if it's not the best approach. Alternatively, she could have addressed it privately without public spamming. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (Not the asshole) because Aaron's comments were the main issue, and the author was reacting to being led on and body-shamed. The spamming, while not ideal, might be seen as a result of her hurt feelings and trying to assert herself.\n"
