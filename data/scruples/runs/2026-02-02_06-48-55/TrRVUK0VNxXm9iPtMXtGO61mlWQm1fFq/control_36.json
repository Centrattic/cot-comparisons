From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepson being kicked out after a blowup during a family trip discussion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The stepson has been with them since he was 13, and there's a history of resentment towards the stepmother because of her ex not providing. The stepmom worked hard to take care of him, but he was resentful. Now he's 19, in college, living with them, and they funded his education. When they asked him to join a family trip, he refused and lashed out with really harsh words towards the stepmom. The parents decided he has to move out in 30 days and stop financial support.\n\nSo the question is whether the parents are at fault. Let's break it down. The stepson is an adult now, 19, but still living at home. He's in college, part-time job, but the parents are covering most of his expenses. The outburst was clearly inappropriate\u2014calling his stepmom a bitch, whore, making derogatory comments about the daughter. That's a serious breach of respect and shows deep-seated issues.\n\nThe parents' response was to cut off financial support and require him to move out. They gave him 30 days to find a job and leave. They're also making him pay for his own trips now. The stepson's behavior, especially the direct verbal abuse towards the stepmom, seems like the main issue here. \n\nThe parents might be doing this to set a boundary, especially since the stepson is an adult. But they're also providing for him, so cutting off support might be a tough love approach. However, considering he's 19 and in college, maybe the parents have a right to expect maturity. The stepson's actions were disrespectful and harmful, so the parents' reaction could be seen as necessary to protect their family and teach responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have considered alternatives before kicking him out. Maybe counseling or having a heart-to-heart? But given the history of therapy not working, they might feel that this is the only option left. Also, the stepson's outburst was a breaking point after years of resentment. The parents had to protect their daughter and wife from such toxic behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The stepson's behavior was clearly wrong, but the parents' response might be too harsh if they didn't give enough support. However, since the stepson is an adult, the parents aren't obligated to support him financially indefinitely. They might be within their rights to set this boundary, especially after such disrespectful actions. \n\nThe key factors are the stepson's age, his adult status, the nature of his outburst, and the parents' efforts to support him. The parents might not be in the wrong here because they're enforcing consequences for unacceptable behavior. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
