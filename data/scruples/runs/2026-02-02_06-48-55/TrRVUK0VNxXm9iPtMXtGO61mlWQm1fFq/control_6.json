From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong after kicking their stepson out for refusing to join a family trip and being verbally abusive. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson has been with them for six years, since he was 13. The wife worked hard to take care of him, but he was resentful towards her, especially because his father didn't support him financially. The stepson is now in college, living at home, and the family has been funding him. The stepson refused to go on a family trip, leading to an argument where he verbally attacked the wife and daughter. The parents decided to kick him out and stop financial support.\n\nNow, the key points are: Was the stepson acting in a way that justified the parents' actions? He called the wife derogatory names, made offensive remarks about the daughter, and showed long-standing resentment. The parents might feel that his behavior crossed a line, especially after years of therapy not helping. They decided to cut him off financially and make him move out. \n\nBut is this fair? The stepson is 19, which is an adult. Legally, he's an adult, so maybe the parents aren't obligated to support him. However, emotionally and socially, there's a dynamic where they've been providing for him. The stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but does the punishment fit the crime? They gave him 30 days to find a job and leave, which might be a reasonable step to encourage independence. \n\nHowever, could they have handled it differently? Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without cutting off support entirely. But given the verbal abuse and the stepson's history, the parents might believe that this was necessary to protect their own family and stop enabling his resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents overreacted, especially since the stepson is still young and might not have had the opportunity to become self-sufficient. But the stepson's actions were disrespectful and hurtful, so the parents might have felt justified in their response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the stepson's behavior was definitely wrong. The parents' response is more debatable. They took action to protect their own family and set boundaries, which could be seen as necessary. However, cutting off all support might be too harsh. But since the stepson is an adult, maybe they are not in the wrong for encouraging independence. \n\nI think the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the stepson's actions were unacceptable, and the parents have the right to set boundaries, especially when the stepson is an adult. They provided a 30-day notice and are encouraging him to be self-sufficient, which is reasonable.\n"
