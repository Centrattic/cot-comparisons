From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, let me recap the situation. The person is married to their stepson's mother, who had been raising him alone with little support from his biological father. The stepson, now 19 and in college, refused to join the family's planned trip to Disney. When confronted, he lashed out at the wife with very harsh words, calling her names and expressing resentment that she didn't provide for him when she could have. The couple decided to kick him out, giving him 30 days to move out and stop financial support unless he gets a better job.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author and their spouse are in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the stepson's behavior: he was openly insulting his step-parent, using derogatory terms, and expressing deep resentment. That's clearly unacceptable. No matter the age, attacking someone with such language is wrong, especially a parent figure. The couple's reaction was to remove their support and ask him to move out. They mention he's 19 and an adult, so expecting him to be independent now makes sense. They had been providing financial support beyond what a typical parent might, since he's their stepson, not their biological child.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepson's resentment stems from past neglect by his biological father and possible feelings of being undervalued. The wife tried her best as a single parent but couldn't provide the same as a two-income household. However, the stepson's response was disproportionate and hurtful. The couple's decision might seem harsh, but they are setting boundaries after being insulted and needing to protect their daughter's environment.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The stepson definitely acted wrong by his outburst. The couple, by removing support, are trying to enforce accountability. Since the stepson is an adult, they aren't obligated to support him financially. They might have been too lenient before, but now they're setting limits. The guilt they feel could be because they care, but their actions are a response to his abuse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action to protect their family and enforce independence. The answer should be B, No.\n"
