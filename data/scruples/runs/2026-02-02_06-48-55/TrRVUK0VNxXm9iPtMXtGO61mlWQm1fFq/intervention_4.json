From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after kicking their 19-year-old stepson out for refusing to go on a family trip. The story is pretty detailed. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the stepson has been with them since he was 13, so that's six years. The stepson's father was a deadbeat, not paying child support but sometimes showing up with gifts. The stepmom worked hard, even sacrificing her own needs. The stepson became resentful, which is understandable given his background. He went to therapists but it didn't help. Now he's in college, still living at home, and the family is paying for him.\n\nThey planned a Disney trip and asked him to come. He refused and then exploded with verbal abuse, calling the stepmom names and saying their daughter was a \"do over.\" The parents decided he had to move out in 30 days and cut financial support. Now they're questioning if they were too harsh.\n\nThe author's position is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are the stepson's behavior, his age, and the parents' response.\n\nThe stepson is 19, an adult, and was given a chance to improve his job and move out. The verbal abuse was severe and targeted the mother and daughter. The parents are providing support but now are cutting off because of the outburst. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, if the stepson is an adult, they might not have an obligation to support him indefinitely. However, he's still in college, so financial support could be a factor. The parents might feel he needs to become independent, especially after such a hostile reaction.\n\nBut was kicking him out immediately and cutting all support too harsh? He's 19, but still young. The parents might have given him an ultimatum, which is a form of holding him accountable. However, cutting off all support (even for school) could be seen as cruel, especially if he's still a student. \n\nOn the other hand, the verbal abuse was egregious. The parents have a right to set boundaries. They might be protecting their own daughter and the wife's well-being. \n\nI think there's a middle ground here. Maybe they could have given him more time to adjust or sought further counseling. But given the circumstances, the parents might feel justified. However, cutting off all support immediately might be too severe, especially if he's still in school. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the response was too harsh for a young adult who's still in college, even though his behavior was unacceptable. Alternatively, if they set a clear boundary for him to become independent, it's not wrong (B). \n\nBut considering he's 19, still in college, and they're cutting all support including school, that's a big leap. Maybe the answer is B because they're holding him accountable for his actions, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
