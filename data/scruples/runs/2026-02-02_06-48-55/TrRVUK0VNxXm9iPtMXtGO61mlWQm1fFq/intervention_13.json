From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson after he refused to come on a family trip and had a hostile outburst. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The stepson is 19, in college, and has been living with the author and his wife. The background mentions that the stepson had long-standing resentment towards the wife, stemming from his mother's inability to provide due to her ex's deadbeat behavior. The author and wife have been supporting him financially, but after an argument where the stepson insulted the wife and their daughter, they decided to kick him out and cut financial support.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The stepson is an adult, 19 years old. Legally, he's an adult, so the obligation of the parents to support him isn't a given unless there's some legal agreement. However, they chose to support him, which is their choice. The stepson's outburst was clearly inappropriate\u2014using derogatory language and showing hostility towards the wife and daughter. The parents felt hurt and decided to set boundaries.\n\nBut the question is whether they were wrong. From a legal standpoint, the parents aren't obligated to support their stepson once he's an adult. So kicking him out isn't illegal. However, morally, it's debatable. The stepson had been struggling with resentment for years, and therapy didn't help. The parents might have felt that this outburst was the breaking point. They gave him a deadline to get a better job and move out, which could be seen as a reasonable ultimatum.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the parents should have given him more support, especially since they've been funding his education and living expenses. The stepson's mental health issues were mentioned, so cutting off support might leave him in a difficult situation. However, the parents also have their own daughter to consider, and their emotional well-being was affected by the stepson's behavior.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the facts. The key factors are the stepson's age, the nature of his outburst, and the parents' decision to set boundaries. Legally and in terms of personal responsibility, the parents have the right to make this decision. Emotionally, it's a tough call, but given the stepson's disrespectful behavior and the parents' efforts to improve their family's dynamics, their actions might be justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's more nuance. Did they give him enough warning? They had been dealing with his resentment for years, and the outburst was the catalyst. It's a judgment call, but the parents are not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
