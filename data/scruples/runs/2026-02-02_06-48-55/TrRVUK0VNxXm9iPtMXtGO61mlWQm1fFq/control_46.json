From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let's break it down.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for kicking their stepson out after he refused to go on a family trip. The stepson has been living with them since he was 13, and there's a history of resentment towards the stepmom because she couldn't provide the things his ex-father did. The stepson is now 19, in college, and still living with them, being funded by them. After the stepson insulted the stepmom and the daughter, the couple kicked him out and cut financial support.\n\nFirst, I should consider the stepson's age. At 19, he's an adult, so they might expect him to be more responsible. But he's in college, which sometimes requires some level of support. However, if he's been living with them for years and they're fully funding him, maybe they expected him to start being independent. The stepson's behavior was definitely disrespectful and abusive, especially towards the stepmom and the daughter. That's a big issue. The parents might have felt that his actions warranted consequences to protect their family's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking him out and cutting off all support might be seen as extreme. Maybe they could have had a conversation, set boundaries, or given him a chance to address his feelings through therapy. But given the stepson's history of resentment and the explosive outburst, the parents might have felt that removing him was necessary to stop the toxic environment.\n\nThe stepson's resentment seems rooted in past experiences, which therapy hasn't resolved. The parents might be trying to protect their daughter and wife from his negativity. However, cutting off all support might have long-term negative impacts on the stepson. He might struggle to find housing and financial stability at 19.\n\nI need to weigh the stepson's abusiveness against the parents' right to protect their family. The parents did give him opportunities (therapy, financial support) but he reacted with hostility. Their response was to set a strict ultimatum, which could be seen as justified given the abuse, but maybe the severity of the punishment is too harsh. The answer likely depends on whether the punishment fits the offense. The stepson's actions were unprovoked and harmful, so the parents might feel justified. However, the stepson is still young, and completely cutting off support might be seen as too severe. But considering the abuse, maybe it's necessary. The answer is probably B (they're not in the wrong) because the stepson's behavior was inexcusable, and the parents set boundaries to protect their family.\n"
