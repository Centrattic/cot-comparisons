From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking out their 19-year-old stepson after he insulted them during a planned family trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepson has been with them for six years, from age 13. The stepmother worked hard to provide, but he was resentful, comparing her to his absent father. Now in college, still lives at home, gets financial support. The family planned a trip, the stepson refused to go, then lashed out with insults towards the stepmother and the daughter. The parents decided to make him move out and cut support unless he pays himself.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. The parents might feel they've done their part, and the stepson is now an adult with responsibilities. His behavior was disrespectful and harmful, especially to the stepmother. The parents giving him a chance to get a better job and move out could be seen as a necessary step to set boundaries. However, he's 19, very young, and maybe the parents should have given more support or sought other solutions first. But the stepson's actions were severe\u2014publicly insulting a family member, being rude to a child. The parents might have felt it was the only way to protect their daughter and themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off support completely might be harsh. He's in college, so losing financial help could impact his future. But maybe he needed to learn responsibility. The parents had tried therapists before. The stepson's resentment was long-standing, and this was the breaking point. \n\nI need to consider if the punishment fits. The parents gave a 30-day ultimatum, which is a clear boundary. They're not cutting him off entirely but setting conditions. Was their reaction proportional? The stepson's behavior was inexcusable, so the parents acting to protect their family might be justified. However, the age of the stepson is a factor. At 19, he's still young, and maybe the parents could have handled it differently. But given the abuse the stepmother endured, their decision to set a firm boundary might be seen as necessary. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents' response was reasonable given the abuse and disrespect. The stepson's actions were clearly wrong, and the parents might have acted in self-defense and for the well-being of their family. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
