From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for kicking their stepson out after he refused to go on a family trip and insulted them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The stepson has been with them for 6 years, since age 13. The stepson was resentful because his ex-dad was a deadbeat, and the wife worked hard to provide but couldn't afford things like the ex did. The stepson is now in college, living at home, and being funded by the couple. When asked to join the Disney trip, he refused and lashed out with harsh insults towards the wife and the daughter. The couple then told him to move out in 30 days and cut financial support.\n\nNow, considering whether the author (and wife) are in the wrong. Let's break it down. The stepson is 19, an adult. The couple provided a lot of support, but he's been resentful for years, and this time escalated to direct insults and disrespect. The couple's decision to cut him off might be seen as a response to his behavior. \n\nPossible angles: The couple is protecting their family and setting boundaries. The stepson is an adult and should take responsibility for his actions. However, some might argue that cutting off support so abruptly is harsh, especially given his age and college status. The couple might have considered other consequences first, like temporary grounding or financial adjustments. But given the severity of his outburst and the ongoing resentment, the couple might feel justified in their decision to enforce accountability. \n\nAlso, the stepson's behavior was abusive, targeting the wife and their daughter. The couple's reaction could be seen as necessary to protect their family's well-being. Since he's an adult, the couple isn't legally obligated to support him, so cutting off financial support is their right. However, the emotional impact on the stepson and potential lack of a safety net could be a concern. \n\nIn the end, whether they're in the wrong depends on the perspective. The story presents the couple as acting in self-defense and to protect their family after years of resentment. The stepson's actions were clearly wrong, and the couple's response is a boundary-setting measure for an adult. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
