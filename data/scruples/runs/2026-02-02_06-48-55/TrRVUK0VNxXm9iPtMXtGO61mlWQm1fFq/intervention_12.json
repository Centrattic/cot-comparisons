From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the stepson has been in the author's family for six years, since he was 13. The wife worked hard to support him, even going without food sometimes. The ex-husband was a deadbeat, giving gifts but no support. Now the stepson is in college, living with them, and they're funding him. The problem started when he refused to join a family trip, and then exploded with insults. The parents decided to kick him out, giving him 30 days to move out and stop supporting him financially.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. Calling his stepmother names and blaming her for past hardships is not acceptable. The parents provided support, and his reaction was disrespectful. They might have felt it was necessary to set boundaries, especially since he's 19 and an adult.\n\nBut on the other hand, the stepson has been struggling with resentment for years. Therapy didn't help, and maybe he's acting out because of deep-seated issues. The parents might not have addressed the root causes, and kicking him out could be seen as a harsh reaction. The stepson is still young, and cutting off all support might impact his ability to finish college. Also, the parents are providing for him, so maybe they expected more maturity, but perhaps they could have handled the situation differently, like having a more open conversation or giving him a chance to explain himself before taking such drastic action.\n\nThe key points here are the stepson's abusive behavior and the parents' response. While the parents have a right to protect their family from abuse, the decision to cut off all support might be too severe. They could have allowed him to stay but made him pay for his own college expenses or contribute more around the house. However, since the stepson is an adult, the parents aren't obligated to support him indefinitely. They did give him a chance by providing for years, and his behavior crossed a line. The 30-day ultimatum might be appropriate as a firm boundary, but they might have considered other consequences first. Overall, the decision seems harsh but perhaps justified given the stepson's actions. The parents might be in the right because the stepson's behavior was unacceptable, but there's a gray area in how they handled it.\n"
