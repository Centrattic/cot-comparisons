From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepson being kicked out by the stepfather and his wife after a confrontation during a planned family trip.\n\nFirst, the stepson has been with them for six years since he was 13. The stepfather mentions that the stepson was resentful from a young age, especially because the wife (his stepmother) couldn't provide the same things as his biological father, who was a deadbeat but gave gifts. The wife worked hard, even sacrificing her own needs. The stepson went to therapy but still resents the stepmother. Now he's in college, living with them, and they've been funding him. Then, when they ask him to join a family trip, he refuses and lashes out with insults, calling the stepmother a bitch, a whore, and making derogatory comments about the stepfather's daughter. The parents respond by giving him 30 days to move out and stop financial support.\n\nSo, the key points here are the stepson's behavior\u2014publicly insulting his stepmother and the daughter, showing ingratitude for the support he's received. The parents feel hurt and decide to cut him off. Is their reaction justified?\n\nOn one hand, the stepson is 19, which is an adult. The parents might feel that he's acting immaturity and not taking responsibility. They've provided financially, which is a big commitment, and his behavior is disrespectful and ungrateful. Cutting him off could be seen as holding him accountable for his actions, especially to protect their daughter and wife from emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents could have handled it differently. Therapy wasn't effective, but maybe there were other avenues to address the resentment. Also, cutting off support abruptly at 19 might be harsh, considering he's still in college and might not have the means to move out immediately. The parents might not have considered alternative solutions, like setting boundaries before completely evicting him.\n\nHowever, the stepson's outburst was a direct attack on the stepmother and daughter, which is a serious issue. The parents have the right to protect their family from abuse. The stepson's behavior shows a lack of respect and gratitude, which justifies the parents' decision to set firm boundaries. They might not be in the wrong for defending their family's well-being.\n\nSo, considering the context, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). The parents are protecting their family from disrespect and holding the adult stepson accountable for his actions.\n"
