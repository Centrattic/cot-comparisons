From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking their stepson out after he refused to go on a family trip and was rude. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the stepson has been in therapy for years but still holds resentment towards the stepmom. The stepmom worked hard to take care of him when he was younger, but he resents her. Now he's in college, living at home, and they've been funding his education. The stepson says no to the family trip, leading to an outburst where he insults the stepmom and the daughter.\n\nThe author's decision is to give him 30 days to move out and stop financial support. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the stepson's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful. He's a grown adult now, 19, so maybe he's responsible for his actions. The parents might be right to set boundaries after years of resentment. They provided support, but his outburst crosses a line.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off support completely might be too harsh. He's in college and might not have the means to move out immediately. The parents could be using this as a wake-up call, but is it fair? Also, the stepson's mental health issues might play a role. Therapy didn't help, so maybe he needs more help rather than punishment.\n\nThe key points are the stepson's behavior, the parents' response, and the stepson's age and situation. The parents had a right to be upset, but the stepson's actions were clearly wrong. However, the decision to kick him out might be a necessary boundary. The stepson needs to learn responsibility, but the parents should consider his circumstances. Maybe a middle ground would be better, but given the extreme nature of the insult, the parents might be justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents set boundaries after the stepson's unacceptable behavior. However, there's a nuance here. But based on the question, the answer is B.\n"
