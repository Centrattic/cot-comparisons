From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking their stepson out after a confrontation about not joining a family trip. The stepson had been showing resentment for years, and this time he lashed out with insults. The parents decided he has to move out and pay for his own stuff if he wants to go on trips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson has been with the family since he was 13, which is a long time. The wife worked hard to provide, but the stepson was resentful because his ex-parent gave him gifts while she couldn't. Even after they got married and things improved financially, the resentment remained. He's in college now, so he's 19, which is an adult. The parents are supporting him with funding, but when he refused the trip and insulted the wife, they kicked him out.\n\nNow, the key points: Is 19 too old to be supported? The parents gave him a job to get a better paying job and move out. They cut off financial support unless he pays his own way. The stepson's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful. The parents might feel they need to set boundaries. But is kicking him out harsh?\n\nOn one hand, the parents are trying to enforce independence. At 19, it's reasonable to expect some self-sufficiency. On the other hand, he's still in college, and moving out suddenly might be difficult. Also, the stepson's mental health is a factor\u2014therapy didn't help, so maybe there's deeper issues. The parents might have handled it more gradually, offering support while setting boundaries.\n\nBut they did give him a job and time to move out. They didn't make it a sudden eviction. The main issue here is the disrespectful behavior towards the mother and sister. That's a serious matter. Parents have the right to protect their family's emotional well-being. So maybe they're justified in cutting off support after that.\n\nSo considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries after the stepson's outburst. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the stepson's behavior was inexcusable. The parents responded proportionally by cutting financial support and requiring him to move out. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
