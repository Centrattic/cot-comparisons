From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepson who was kicked out after a confrontation during a family trip discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The stepson has been resentful for years towards the husband's wife (now his stepmother). She worked hard to support him, even going without food, but he resents her for not providing things others had. He's in college, living at home, funded by them. The stepson refused to go on a family trip, then lashed out with insults. The parents decided he had to move out and stop supporting him financially unless he gets a better job.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. The stepson's behavior was clearly unacceptable\u2014insulting his stepmother, calling her names, attacking their daughter. That's a serious issue. The parents have been supportive, providing for him, but he's 19 now, an adult. Setting boundaries makes sense here. Kicking him out could be seen as necessary to protect their family and stop enabling his resentment.\n\nHowever, maybe the parents should have tried more to address the underlying issues before taking such a drastic step. Therapy didn't work, but maybe other approaches? Also, the stepson is still in college, so cutting off financial support might affect his education. But the parents might feel he needs to become independent.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepson's outburst was inexcusable. The parents were trying to be a family, and his behavior was disrespectful and harmful. They have a young daughter; the environment needs to be positive for her. \n\nThe user says they think the author is wrong, but maybe they're just feeling guilty. But objectively, the parents had a right to set a boundary after such an outburst. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a tough decision to stop enabling toxic behavior.\n"
