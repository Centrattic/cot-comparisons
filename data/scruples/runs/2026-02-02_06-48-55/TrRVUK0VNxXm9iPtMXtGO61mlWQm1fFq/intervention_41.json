From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after kicking out their stepson for refusing to join a family trip. The stepson was 19, in college, and had been living with them. The stepson had a history of resentment towards the stepmom, and this incident was the breaking point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the story. The stepson has been resentful for years, the parents tried therapy, and the stepson made offensive comments. The parents decided he had to move out and stop financial support. The question is about whether the parents are in the wrong here.\n\nThe parents' actions seem harsh, but they might be justified given the stepson's behavior. At 19, he's an adult. The parents might feel they've given him chances and that his behavior is unacceptable. However, cutting him off completely could be seen as extreme. They are providing support but setting a boundary after abuse. The stepson's insults were directed at the mother, which is a serious issue. The parents might be within their rights to enforce boundaries, especially if the stepson is capable of working and moving out. But the age and the fact that he's in college might make some people think it's too harsh. Also, the stepson's mental health could be a factor\u2014therapy didn't help, but maybe more support is needed. However, the parents have a right to protect their family and set limits on abuse. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are enforcing boundaries after the stepson's unacceptable behavior. But others might argue they're being too strict given his age and college status. However, the parents can choose to support or not support as they see fit, especially after the stepson's outburst. So probably B.\n"
