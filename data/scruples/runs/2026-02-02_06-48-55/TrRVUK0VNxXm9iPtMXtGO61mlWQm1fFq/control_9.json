From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepson being kicked out for refusing to go on a family trip after being rude to the stepmother. \n\nFirst, the stepson has been in their lives for six years since he was 13. He was resentful that his stepmom, a cosmetologist, couldn't provide the things he saw others have. She worked hard, even going without food sometimes, but the ex was a deadbeat who gave big gifts when he visited. After they married, the stepson's life improved with two incomes, but he's still resentful and ungrateful. They've sent him to therapy multiple times, which didn't help.\n\nNow he's in college, still living with them, and they're funding him. They planned a Disney trip. He refused to come, then when confronted, he exploded with insults towards the stepmom, calling her a bitch, whore, etc., and made comments about the daughter. The parents decided he had to move out in 30 days, cut financial support, etc. They're now wondering if they were too harsh because he's young (19) but also an adult.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parents were wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe parents provided support and opportunities. The stepson, despite being in college, is still acting out with resentment. His behavior is clearly disrespectful and inappropriate. The parents set boundaries by cutting support if he doesn't get a better job and move out. \n\nBut he's 19, which is a young adult. However, in many places, the age of majority is 18, so he's legally an adult. The parents might feel responsible for his well-being, but his behavior crossed a line. They had to enforce consequences for the safety and well-being of their family, especially the wife and daughter. \n\nThe resentment and verbal abuse directed at the stepmom and daughter are serious. The parents had to protect their family from toxic behavior. By setting the 30-day ultimatum, they're giving him a chance to find his own way instead of continuing to enable his resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents could have handled it differently, like giving him more time or additional support. But given the long-standing issues and the recent outburst, the parents' decision seems justified. They\u2019re not forcing him to leave immediately but giving a deadline. \n\nSo overall, the parents aren't in the wrong. They're protecting their family from abuse and holding the stepson accountable for his actions. The answer is B.\n"
