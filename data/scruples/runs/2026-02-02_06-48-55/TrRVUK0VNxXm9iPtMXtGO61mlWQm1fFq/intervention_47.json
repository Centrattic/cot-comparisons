From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The story is about a stepson who's been resentful for years, and after a confrontation during a family trip discussion, the parents decide to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' actions. The stepson is 19, which is an adult. The parents provided financial support and housing, but now they're cutting off support after he lashed out with anger and insults. The stepson has been in therapy for years, but the problem seems unresolved. The parents might feel they've given him chances and that his behavior was unacceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off support abruptly might be harsh. The stepson is still young and in college. Moving out and getting a better job in 30 days is a tight deadline. The parents might not have considered other options, like setting boundaries without full eviction. Also, the stepson's resentment could stem from past neglect, which the parents tried to compensate for after marrying. \n\nThe key points: The stepson's behavior was inexcusable, but the parents' response might be overly punitive. The age is a factor\u201419 is an adult, but still young. The parents might feel justified in stopping support due to his disrespectful behavior. However, the sudden decision without allowing him time to adjust could be seen as too harsh. \n\nI think the parents had a right to set boundaries after the outburst, but the method might be questionable. Maybe they should have given more time or discussed alternatives. However, the stepson's actions were definitely wrong. The balance here is tricky. The parents might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their daughter and wife, but the response's harshness could be an issue. Still, considering the context, the parents' actions might be seen as justified. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
