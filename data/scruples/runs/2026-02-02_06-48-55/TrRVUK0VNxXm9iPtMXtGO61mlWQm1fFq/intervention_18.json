From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is married to his wife, who has a stepson. The stepson has been living with them, and they've been supporting him financially while he's in college. The stepson is 19 now. The problem arises when the stepson refuses to go on a family trip to Disney, and then verbally attacks the wife during a discussion about it. The stepson calls her derogatory names, accuses her of not providing for him, and makes cruel comments about the daughter. The parents then kick him out, giving him 30 days to move out and stop supporting him financially. They're now wondering if they were too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the stepson's behavior. He's been resentful for years, but this time he crossed a line by being openly disrespectful and abusive. That's pretty serious. The parents have been providing for him, and his reaction seems ungrateful and hurtful. The wife is clearly emotionally affected, as she cried for hours. The parents decided to cut him off, which is a significant punishment, especially since he's in college and likely not set up to live independently yet.\n\nNow, considering the parents' actions. They gave a 30-day notice, which is a reasonable period for him to find a job and move out. However, they're also cutting off financial support for his school, which he's partway through. That could be problematic because he's still a student and might not be able to get a better-paying job quickly. They might be punishing him for his behavior, which is understandable, but is this fair?\n\nThe parents are both feeling some guilt afterward. They might be questioning if they were too strict, especially since he's still young. But at 19, he's an adult. The question is whether the punishment fits the crime. The stepson's verbal abuse is inexcusable, and the parents have a right to set boundaries. However, removing all financial support might impact his education and future, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, they had already tried therapists, and it didn't help. Maybe they felt this was the only way to enforce respect. But taking away his housing and financial support could have long-term consequences for him. The parents might need to consider if there's a middle ground, like giving him some support while he finds his feet instead of cutting him off completely.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong: the stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate, so the parents had a reason to act. However, their response might be disproportionate. Kicking someone out when they're in college and dependent on you is a big step. They might have handled it differently, like reducing support but not cutting it entirely, or giving him a chance to apologize. The parents might be justified in wanting to stop enabling his behavior, but the punishment could be too severe given his age and circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the punishment matches the offense. The parents were in a tough spot, but their reaction could be seen as too harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their decision on the stepson's future.\n"
