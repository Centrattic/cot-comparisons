From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson after he refused to go on a family trip and was verbally abusive. The stepson is 19, in college, and the author and his wife are providing financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The stepson has shown resentment towards the wife for years, even after living with them for six years. He was abusive, calling the wife names and making derogatory comments about their daughter. The parents decided to cut off financial support and require him to move out. The stepson is an adult, 19 years old, so maybe they feel he should be more independent.\n\nBut wait, is 19 old enough to be on their own? The parents have been funding his education and living expenses. They might have expected him to contribute or be respectful. However, the trigger was the family trip refusal and subsequent outburst. The parents might feel that his behavior was unacceptable and that they can't support someone who's disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off support entirely might be harsh. He's in college, which is a significant investment. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting consequences that require him to address his behavior without full eviction. Also, considering his mental health history with therapy not helping, maybe they should have sought more help instead of immediate punishment.\n\nBut the stepson's actions were extreme. He was verbally abusive, which is a serious issue. The parents have the right to set boundaries, especially in their own home. If he's an adult, they might be justified in pushing him towards independence. However, the timing and the method of cutting him off could be questioned. Was giving 30 days reasonable? Could they have offered support to find a job or housing?\n\nThe parents' emotional reaction is understandable. The wife cried for hours, and the stepson's comments were hurtful. But was kicking him out the best solution? Maybe not. Could there have been a way to address the resentment without full eviction? Possibly. However, after such an outburst, the parents felt compelled to act, and their decision might be seen as a necessary boundary.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The parents might not be in the wrong because they have the right to their home and safety. The stepson's behavior was inexcusable. But the severity of the punishment could be debated. However, given the context, the parents' actions might be justified. Answer B.\n"
