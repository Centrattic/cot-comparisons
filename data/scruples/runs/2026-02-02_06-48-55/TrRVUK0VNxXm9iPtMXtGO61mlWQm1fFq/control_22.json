From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if the person (the author and their wife) is the asshole for kicking their stepson out after he refused to go on a family trip and verbally attacked them. The stepson was 19, in college, living with them, and they've been funding his education. The stepson has a history of resentment towards the stepmother (the author's wife) because of past financial struggles. The conflict escalated when the stepson called the wife derogatory names, made hurtful comments about the daughter, and expressed his anger openly. The parents decided to give him 30 days to move out and stop financial support. They're now feeling guilty but wondering if they were too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepson is 19, which is considered an adult. However, he's still in college and living at home, so maybe expectations vary. The parents have been supporting him financially, which might have set certain expectations. The stepson's resentment seems deep-rooted, possibly due to past experiences with his biological father not providing and the stepmother's financial sacrifices. The outburst was significant, involving verbal abuse towards the mother and the stepdaughter. The parents' response was to cut off financial support and require him to move out within a month.\n\nNow, evaluating their actions. They gave him a 30-day notice, which is a reasonable time frame to find a job and move out. They're also cutting off financial support, which is logical if he's an adult. The stepson's behavior was abusive, so the parents might feel justified in setting boundaries. On the other hand, the stepson is still in college and might need support. The parents might have considered alternatives, like counseling, but they mentioned they've already sent him to multiple therapists without success. If therapy didn't work, their options are limited. \n\nThe parents' actions could be seen as necessary to protect their current family and set boundaries after a hurtful outburst. However, cutting off support completely might be harsh, but given the stepson's disrespectful behavior and the fact that he's an adult, perhaps it's a fair response. The guilt they feel is understandable, but they're also trying to protect their daughter and wife from further emotional harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents aren't in the wrong. They set boundaries after abuse and are encouraging the stepson to take responsibility as an adult. The stepson's actions were unacceptable, so their response is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
