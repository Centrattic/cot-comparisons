From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a stepson who was kicked out after refusing to go on a family trip and getting verbally abusive. The stepson is 19, living with his stepdad and stepmom, who've been supporting him through college. The stepmom is a cosmetologist who worked hard to provide for him when he was younger, but he was resentful because he thought she didn't give him enough, especially compared to what his dad (the ex) gave. Now, when they plan a trip to Disney, he refuses to come and then yells at them, calling them names and showing deep resentment. The parents decide he needs to move out and stop supporting him financially unless he gets a better job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, 19 is an adult, so the parents aren't legally obligated to support him anymore. However, in some cases, if the child is still in school, parents might choose to help. But the parents here are providing financial support beyond what's typical, especially since they have their own child now. The stepson's behavior was disrespectful and abusive. The parents might be justified in setting boundaries, especially after years of resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that kicking out an 18-19-year-old who's in college could be harsh, especially if they're not ready to be independent. The stepson might need support even with a job. But the parents were providing more than just basic needs\u2014they were cooking, buying necessities, paying for school. If he's not willing to contribute or respect them, cutting off support might be necessary for their own well-being. Also, his verbal abuse was severe, which could justify the parents' reaction to protect their family, especially their daughter.\n\nThe key points here are the stepson's age, his behavior, and the parents' right to set boundaries. Since he's an adult, they can choose to stop supporting him. The abuse he directed at the stepmom is a significant factor. The parents might have handled it correctly by giving him a timeline to become independent. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
