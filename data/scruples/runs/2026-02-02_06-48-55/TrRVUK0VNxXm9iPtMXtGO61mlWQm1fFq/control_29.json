From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the stepson's been difficult for years. The wife took care of him when he was younger, even though she couldn't provide the same things as his deadbeat dad. Now, even with financial support, he's resentful and lashing out during a family trip discussion. The stepson called the wife some terrible names and made hurtful comments about the daughter. The parents decided he had to move out and stop supporting him financially.\n\nSo, the key points: the stepson is 19, an adult. He's been in therapy but still has extreme resentment. The parents provided a lot, but he's acting out. The stepson's behavior was disrespectful and abusive. \n\nThe question is whether the parents overstepped. On one hand, they offered support, but he's an adult and should be responsible. On the other hand, maybe they were too quick to cut him off. But the stepson's actions were really hurtful and ungrateful. The parents are also protecting their daughter. Maybe they had to set boundaries to prevent further harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the parents might not be in the wrong. They gave him time and resources, but after such a disrespectful outburst, it's reasonable to expect him to leave. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Like, is 30 days too short? Or is moving out at 19 realistic? Well, the parents are giving him a chance to find a job. Maybe it's fair. So, I think B is the correct choice.\n"
