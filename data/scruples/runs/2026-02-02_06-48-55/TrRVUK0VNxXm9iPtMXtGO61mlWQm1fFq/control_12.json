From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a stepson who was kicked out of the family home after a confrontation during a planned family trip. The stepson has been living with them while going to college, and the parents have been financially supporting him. Now, when he refuses to go on a family trip, he lashes out verbally at the stepmother and the family, leading the parents to decide he must move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson has been resentful towards the stepmother for years, stemming from his childhood when his biological father wasn't supportive. The stepmother worked hard to provide for him, but he's still holding onto that resentment. Now that he's 19 and in college, he's acting out. The parents felt he was being disrespectful, using harsh language, and making personal attacks. They decided to cut off financial support and require him to move out.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for doing this? Well, as an adult, the stepson is 19, which is considered an adult in most legal contexts. The parents have been supporting him financially, but if he's acting this way and not being respectful, maybe they have a right to set boundaries. However, college students often rely on their families for support, so cutting it off might be harsh. But the stepson's behavior\u2014calling his stepmother a bitch and a whore, attacking the daughter, and being verbally abusive\u2014seems like a major issue. The parents might feel that his behavior is unacceptable for someone living under their roof and being supported financially.\n\nBut could they have handled it differently? Maybe given him a warning first, or tried to talk to him without cutting off all support immediately. However, the parents might have felt that the emotional abuse was too much, especially after years of passive resentment turning into active hostility. The stepson's actions were not just disrespectful but harmful to the family's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents did give him a chance to get a better job and move out in 30 days. If he's 19, maybe he should be more independent. But if he's in college, finding a better job might be challenging. There's a balance between accountability and support. The parents might be doing what they think is necessary to protect their family's emotional health and to enforce respect.\n\nI think the key factors here are the stepson's adult age, his disrespectful behavior, and the parents' right to set boundaries. While kicking him out is a significant step, given the abuse and the stepson's age, it's a decision that could be seen as justified. However, some might argue it's too harsh given his age and educational status. But considering the verbal attacks and the parents' need to maintain a respectful household, it's a tough call. I might lean towards the parents not being in the wrong because they're enforcing respect and independence, even if it's difficult.\n"
