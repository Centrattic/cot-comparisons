From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out their 19-year-old stepson after he insulted their wife and showed resentment. \n\nFirst, the stepson has been living with them and being supported financially. He's in college, but they're funding him. The stepson's behavior is a key point here. He called the stepmom derogatory names, made a comment about the daughter being a \"do over,\" and his resentment is longstanding, even after their support. \n\nThe parents decided he has to move out and stop getting financial support. The question is whether this was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the stepson is an adult and should be responsible for himself. At 19, he's old enough to leave, and the parents might feel they've given him enough support. Their decision to stop funding his college and move out makes sense if he's not showing gratitude or respect.\n\nBut on the other hand, they've been supporting him for years, and maybe cutting off support abruptly is harsh. The stepson might have underlying issues from his past, like the father's absence and lack of support. The parents also mention guilt, which suggests they might feel conflicted about their decision. \n\nHowever, considering the stepson's disrespectful behavior and the fact that he's an adult, the parents' actions could be seen as necessary to set boundaries. They might be protecting their own child and wife's well-being. The stepson's actions were not just disrespectful to the parents but also to the daughter, which adds to the justification.\n\nSo, balancing the stepson's age, his disrespectful behavior, and the parents' efforts to support him, the decision might be seen as justified. They\u2019re holding him accountable for his actions, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
