From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a stepson who's 19, living with his step-parents, and they kicked him out after he insulted them during a planned family trip.\n\nFirst, the stepson has been resentful for years because his mom (the wife in the story) couldn't provide as much as the dad's ex did, even though she worked hard. The stepson is now in college, and the family is funding him, but he's not grateful. When asked to join a trip, he refuses and then yells at them with harsh words. The parents decide he has to move out and stop getting their support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (and wife) were wrong. Let me break down the key points:\n\n1. **Resentment history**: The stepson had a hard past, maybe justified some resentment, but he's acting out now as an adult. The parents tried therapy, which didn't help.\n2. **Adult responsibilities**: At 19, he's an adult. Should he be expected to manage his life without parental support? The parents are giving him an ultimatum to get a better job and move out, which might be setting boundaries.\n3. **Insults and behavior**: The stepson's outburst was extremely disrespectful, including calling the wife a \"bitch and whore\" and attacking the daughter. That's a serious breach of respect.\n4. **Parents' response**: They gave him 30 days and are cutting financial support. Is this too harsh? Maybe he needs to learn responsibility, but they had been funding him through college, so suddenly cutting off might be abrupt.\n5. **Emotional impact**: The wife cried for hours, which is understandable. But the stepson's behavior was inexcusable. The parents might be protecting their own family's well-being.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the punishment fair? The stepson was living with them, and they were funding him. If he's an adult, maybe they were right to set boundaries. But cutting off support entirely could affect his education. On the other hand, his behavior was unacceptable, and the parents had tried to be supportive for years. They might feel justified in protecting their marriage and their daughter's environment.\n\nI think the key here is that the stepson crossed a line with his verbal abuse, and the parents are enforcing consequences. Even though they might feel guilty, it's about maintaining their own family's peace. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. However, given the options, B seems correct.\n"
