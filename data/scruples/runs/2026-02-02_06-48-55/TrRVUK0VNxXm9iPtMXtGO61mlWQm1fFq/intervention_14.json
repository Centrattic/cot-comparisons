From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after kicking out their 19-year-old stepson for refusing to go on a family trip and being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The stepson has been resentful for years, the stepmother worked hard to support him despite financial struggles, and he's been in therapy but not improved. He's in college and living with them, getting financial support. The trip was planned, he declined, and then lashed out with insults towards the wife and the daughter. The parents decided he has to move out and pay his own way now.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate. He called his stepmother a derogatory name, insulted her sacrifices, and belittled the daughter. That's abusive and disrespectful. The parents might feel they need to set boundaries, especially since he's 19 and should be responsible. They could argue that enabling his behavior by supporting him financially without consequences is harmful in the long run. They might also be protecting their daughter and wife from his negativity.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking him out at 19 might be too harsh. He's still in college, which is a time when many students rely on family support. Cutting off all support suddenly could be seen as extreme, even if he deserved consequences. The parents might not have considered alternatives, like reducing support but not cutting it off completely, or giving him a chance to reflect and apologize. Also, the initial refusal to go on the trip might not have been a valid reason for such a drastic action unless the trip was a significant family event they expected his participation in.\n\nAnother angle: the parents have been providing for him, but his resentment might stem from deeper issues. If therapy hasn't helped, maybe another approach is needed. However, the outburst was a breaking point. The parents might feel that they can't allow such behavior to continue, especially after years of passive resentment.\n\nI should also consider legal aspects. At 19, he's an adult, so the parents aren't legally obligated to support him. They can choose to stop providing financial help. But emotionally and socially, is it fair? It depends on the circumstances. If he's capable of getting a better job, maybe it's pushing him towards independence. However, if he's still in college, finding a better job might be challenging.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think the stepson's outburst was a one-time event and the parents overreacted. Or they might think the stepson's behavior justified the action. But given that the resentment was long-standing and the outburst was severe, the parents might have had enough.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' actions might seem harsh, the stepson's behavior was inexcusable. However, cutting off support entirely could be seen as too extreme, especially without considering other consequences. The answer hinges on whether the parents' reaction was proportionate. If the stepson was abusive and ungrateful, setting a boundary is reasonable. But if the trip refusal was the main trigger, then the punishment might not fit the action. However, given the history, the parents might feel justified.\n"
