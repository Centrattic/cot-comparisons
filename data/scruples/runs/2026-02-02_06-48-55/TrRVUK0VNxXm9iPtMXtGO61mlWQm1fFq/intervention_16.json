From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after kicking out their stepson for refusing a family trip. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out my own opinion based on the details.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The stepson, now 19 and in college, has been living with his stepmother and the author (the stepfather) for 6 years. The stepmother tried her best to provide for him as a single mom, even though her ex was a deadbeat. The stepson was resentful because he didn't get the things others had, like big gifts from his dad. Now that he's living with them, he's been ungrateful and had therapy that didn't help. When the family planned a Disney trip, he refused to go, then lashed out at the stepmother with insults, calling her names, and making derogatory comments about the daughter. The parents decided he had to move out in 30 days and cut off financial support.\n\nSo, the parents are upset because of the rude behavior. The stepson's outburst was clearly inappropriate. He's an adult, but still in college. Now, the parents are wondering if they were too harsh, especially given his age. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nLet me consider the factors. The stepson's behavior was abusive and disrespectful. The parents provided support, and he was ungrateful, even after years of their efforts. They set boundaries, which is their right as parents. However, he's 19, which is legally an adult, so there's a balance between being a parent and respecting his autonomy. \n\nBut maybe the parents were too hasty. They gave him 30 days to find a job and move out. Is that reasonable? Well, considering he's in college, finding a job might be challenging, especially if he's a student. The stepmother and author might have expected him to contribute more, but they were funding him. However, the stepson's outburst was a trigger for the decision. The key is whether the punishment fits the offense.\n\nThe stepson's actions were inexcusable. The parents were within their rights to set boundaries. However, cutting off all support immediately might be harsh. But given the abuse he directed at the stepmother, maybe it's justified. Also, the stepson was in a better position financially, so the parents might have the right to ask him to support himself now. \n\nAnother angle: the stepson was in therapy, but it didn't help. The parents tried to give him opportunities. The outburst was the last straw. They might be protecting their daughter and wife's well-being by removing him. So the decision to kick him out could be a necessary step to maintain family harmony. \n\nBut considering his age, maybe the parents should have given him more time or sought other solutions before cutting him off completely. However, the stepson's behavior crossed a line. The parents have the right to enforce consequences for such disrespect. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
