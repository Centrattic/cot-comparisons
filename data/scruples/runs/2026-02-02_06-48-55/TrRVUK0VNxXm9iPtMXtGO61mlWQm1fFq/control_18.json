From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the stepson being kicked out after refusing to go on a family trip and lashing out. The stepson has been resentful for years because his stepmother couldn't provide the same things as his dad's gifts. The stepmom worked hard, and they've funded his college, but he's 19 and still living at home.\n\nFirst, the stepson called his stepmom a bitch and a whore, which is pretty severe. He also insulted the daughter. That kind of behavior is definitely not acceptable. The parents decided to give him 30 days to move out and stop financial support. The stepson is an adult, 19, so maybe the parents expect him to be more independent. But he's in college and has part-time work. \n\nOn one hand, the parents are trying to set boundaries after years of resentment and a sudden outburst. They've been funding him, but he's not grateful and is acting out. On the other hand, he's still in college, so maybe he's not yet fully independent. The parents might have been too quick to cut off support, but the stepson's behavior was inexcusable. \n\nThe parents did try therapists before, but it didn't help. The stepson's resentment might be deep-rooted, and this outburst was a breaking point. The parents are also taking into account their 3-year-old daughter's well-being. However, giving him 30 days to move out might be harsh considering he's still a student. Maybe there could have been a middle ground, like setting clear boundaries but allowing gradual independence instead of immediate eviction. \n\nBut the stepson's actions were abusive towards his stepmom and sister. The parents have the right to protect their family and set consequences. Since he's an adult, it's also reasonable to expect him to take responsibility for his behavior. So, maybe the parents are justified in their decision. However, the immediate eviction without considering his educational status might be a point against them. \n\nOverall, the stepson's behavior was unacceptable, and the parents needed to take action. But the timing and method of their response might be questioned. However, given the context, the parents aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B.\n"
