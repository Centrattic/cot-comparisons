From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepdad and his wife kicking their stepson out after he refused to join a family trip and lashed out verbally.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The stepson, now 19 and in college, has been living with them for years, funded by them. The stepdad and wife have two incomes, which improved the stepson's life. However, the stepson is resentful, especially towards the stepmom, and this culminated in a confrontation where he called her names and expressed anger. The parents then gave him 30 days to move out and stop financial support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The parents have the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel disrespected. Also, the stepson is 19, an adult, so maybe they are justified in cutting him off to encourage independence. However, is 30 days too short? Did they give him a chance to reflect or seek help? The parents had already tried therapists before, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like having a longer conversation or more support.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents provided a lot of support, and the stepson's resentment might have roots in past neglect. The sudden cutoff might be harsh, especially since he's in college. But the author's actions were a response to the stepson's abuse. The parents might be protecting their daughter and wife from further harm.\n\nThe question is whether the parents overstepped. The stepson's actions were inexcusable, and the parents have the authority to set consequences. However, the stepson is young and might not be ready for independence. The parents might be right in cutting ties, but could they have found a middle ground? Maybe a longer transition period or encouraging him to seek more help. But given the severity of the stepson's outburst, the parents might have felt justified in their decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The stepson's behavior warranted consequences, and the parents are within their rights to set those, especially as he's an adult. The answer is B.\n"
