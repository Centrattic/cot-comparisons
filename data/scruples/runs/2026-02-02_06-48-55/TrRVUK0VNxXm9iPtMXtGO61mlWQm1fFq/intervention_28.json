From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for kicking their stepson out after he refused to come on a family trip. The stepson had a history of resentment towards the stepmom, and during the confrontation, he lashed out with harsh words. The parents decided to set boundaries, giving him 30 days to move out and stop financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate. Insulting his stepmother in front of the father and making derogatory remarks about the daughter shows a lack of respect and emotional maturity. The parents had been supporting him financially despite his behavior, which they tried to address through therapy. The explosion happened when the stepson was 19, which is technically an adult, but still young.\n\nThe decision to cut him off financially and force him to move out might be seen as a consequence for his actions. However, there's a question of whether the punishment fits the offense. The stepson refused to go on a trip, which seems like a relatively minor issue compared to the consequences. But the underlying issue was his long-standing resentment and the verbal abuse, which justified stricter measures.\n\nAlso, the parents are responsible for their own child (the three-year-old) and need to protect her environment. Allowing the stepson to remain under the same roof after such a display could affect the daughter's well-being. The parents might be trying to set a boundary that the stepson needs to respect their household rules and treat everyone with dignity.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off all support might be too harsh, especially if the stepson is still in college and lacks the means to support himself. They had been funding him, which could be a significant financial burden if he has to pay for his own school now. However, since he's an adult, the argument could be made that he should take responsibility for his education and living expenses, especially after displaying such disrespect.\n\nThe parents' guilt after a few days suggests they might be reconsidering their decision. But given the stepson's behavior, their actions were a response to protect their marriage and their daughter. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were enforcing boundaries after repeated issues and a severe outburst. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
