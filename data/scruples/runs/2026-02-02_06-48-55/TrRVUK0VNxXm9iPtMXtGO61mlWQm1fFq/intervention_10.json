From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a stepson being kicked out after refusing to go on a family trip and lashing out. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The stepson has been resentful for years towards the stepmother, leading to therapy. Now, he's 19, in college, and lives with them. When asked to join a family trip, he refuses and attacks the stepmother. The parents kick him out, saying he has to move out in 30 days and can't rely on them anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here: the stepson's behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014he called the stepmother names and made hurtful comments. The parents decided to cut off financial support and make him leave. The user questions if the parents were too harsh, considering his age. \n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the stepson's actions were disrespectful and hurtful, and the parents might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, the stepson is 19, still in college, and hasn't been working a better-paying job yet. Kicking him out might leave him in a difficult position financially. \n\nBut the parents have been supporting him, and he was given opportunities. The stepson's outburst was a direct attack on the stepmother, which is a serious issue. The parents might believe that his behavior was unacceptable and that continued support would enable his resentment. \n\nHowever, considering his age and educational status, is cutting him off entirely fair? Maybe they could have given him a chance to address his behavior with consequences, but not full eviction. The stepson's mental health is another factor\u2014therapy hasn't helped, so maybe there's an underlying issue that needs attention. \n\nThe parents might have felt that their patience has run out, but there's a line between setting boundaries and being overly harsh. The stepson might need to find his own path now, but being 19 and suddenly having to leave and get a better job could be a significant challenge. The parents could be seen as cutting the apron strings, which is a common transition for young adults, but the way it was handled might be seen as too abrupt given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepson's actions were disrespectful and hurtful, and the parents have the right to set limits, especially if they're no longer willing to tolerate the negative behavior. They might be encouraging him to become more independent, which is appropriate as he's an adult now. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents' response is considered too harsh, then the author would be in the wrong. However, if the stepson's behavior was the catalyst, then the parents might be justified. It's a tough call. The parents did give him multiple chances with therapy, so their decision might be seen as a last resort. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents' actions were proportionate to the stepson's behavior. The stepson's outburst was severe, but the parents' response might be seen as too strict given his age and situation. However, since he's 19 and supposed to be becoming independent, maybe it's appropriate. \n\nIn AITA terms, these stories often depend on public opinion. The community might side with the parents because they were standing up for themselves after years of resentment, but others might think they were too quick to kick him out. But considering the stepson's attack and the parents' efforts, they might be seen as justified. The user initially thought the author is wrong, but maybe the community would say different. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the stepson's actions were worse, and the parents are setting boundaries for their own well-being. However, some might argue the parents were too harsh. But in AITA, often the person who stands up for themselves against toxic behavior isn't considered the asshole. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
