From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the stepson is being kicked out of the family trip and eventually given 30 days to move out after a blowout argument. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, looking at the stepson's behavior. He's 19, in college, and still living with the family. He's been resentful for years, had therapy that didn't help, and now he lashed out with really hurtful comments towards the stepmom and the daughter. Calling his stepmom a bitch and a whore is pretty severe, especially in front of others. He also made derogatory remarks about the daughter. That's not just disrespectful but cruel. So the parents felt justified in setting boundaries after that.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have been supporting him financially, providing for his education and basic needs. They took him in after his father was a deadbeat, and the stepmom worked hard to take care of him. The stepson's resentment might stem from legitimate feelings of neglect in the past, but expressing it through anger and insults isn't acceptable. The parents had to draw a line when he crossed it with his outburst.\n\nThe parents gave him a chance to improve, 30 days to find a better job and move out. That seems reasonable, considering he's an adult. They're cutting off financial support, which they have the right to do since he's no longer a child. The trip was a family event, and kicking him out of it was a way to enforce that he needs to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? Like, could they have had a different approach? Maybe given him a stern warning first? However, given the severity of the outburst, the parents might have felt that immediate action was necessary to protect their family's well-being and their own emotional health. The stepmom was in tears, which shows the impact of his words. The parents' reaction is about enforcing respect and holding him accountable for his behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents' actions seem to be a response to the stepson's unprovoked aggression and disrespect. They're holding him responsible for his adult actions, which is fair. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
