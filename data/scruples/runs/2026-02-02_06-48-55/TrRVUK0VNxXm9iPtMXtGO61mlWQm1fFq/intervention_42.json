From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson after he refused to join a family trip and said some hurtful things. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The stepson is 19, in college, and has been living with the couple. The stepson has a history of resentment towards the stepmother, which has been ongoing for years. The couple provided for him, funded his education, etc. When they planned a family trip, he refused to go and lashed out with insults. The couple then decided he had to move out in 30 days and stop receiving support.\n\nSo, the key points are: the stepson's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful, especially towards the stepmother. The couple has been supporting him financially despite his attitude. They set a boundary after this incident. The stepson is an adult, which complicates things because he's supposed to be independent, but he's still living at home and using their resources.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate. Is setting a boundary after abuse and disrespect justified? The couple gave him multiple chances, including therapy, which didn't work. The stepson's behavior escalated to direct verbal abuse. The parents (or step-parents) might feel they can't continue supporting someone who is so disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the stepson is young and may not have the means to move out immediately. But he's 19 and in college; maybe they expected him to start becoming independent. The couple is giving him 30 days to get a better job and move out, which is a reasonable timeframe for an adult to start taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off all support might be harsh. They are stopping cooking, buying essentials, and paying for school. If he's in college and already has a part-time job, maybe he can manage with additional work. But the financial support might have been crucial for his education. \n\nSo, was the couple wrong? It's a tough call. They had to set a boundary after abuse, which is understandable. However, the stepson's age and circumstances might mean they should have found another way to address the behavior without cutting him off entirely. \n\nBut considering the stepson's actions\u2014calling his stepmother a bitch and a whore, attacking their daughter, and showing no gratitude\u2014maybe the couple had no choice but to enforce consequences. They had tried therapy and other methods. The stepson's behavior was not justified, and the parents have the right to protect their family's well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, while the decision might seem harsh, given the context of ongoing resentment and the verbal abuse, the parents might not be in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
