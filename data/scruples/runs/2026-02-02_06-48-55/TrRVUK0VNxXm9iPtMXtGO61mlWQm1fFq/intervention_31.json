From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepson being kicked out for refusing to go on a family trip. The parents and stepson have a history of tension, with the stepson being resentful towards the stepmother. The stepson is 19, in college, and still living at home. He was disrespectful, called the stepmother names, and made hurtful comments. The parents decided to give him 30 days to move out and stop financial support unless he pays for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They've been supporting him financially, providing for his education, and they were hurt by his outburst. They might feel that he's an adult and should be more responsible. They could argue that he's been given opportunities but is ungrateful and hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepson is 19, which is still young. College students often rely on family support. The stepson's behavior was clearly wrong\u2014he was rude and expressed deep resentment. However, cutting off all support might be too harsh. Maybe there could have been a middle ground, like setting boundaries without completely evicting him. Also, the parents might be overreacting out of hurt and anger, leading to a decision they might regret later.\n\nBut considering the stepson's actions\u2014publicly humiliating the stepmother, calling her names, and making derogatory remarks about the daughter\u2014it's understandable that the parents felt the need to protect their family. They might have felt that this was a line he shouldn't cross. However, giving him 30 days to find a better job and move out might be a way to encourage independence, but at 19, is that too abrupt? Also, cutting off financial support for school and necessities might impact his education and future.\n\nAnother angle: the parents sent him to therapy multiple times, but it didn't help. Maybe they tried to address the issues before. The stepson's resentment might stem from valid feelings of neglect or comparison with others. However, expressing that through insults is unacceptable. The parents have a right to set boundaries, especially after such behavior.\n\nBut is kicking him out without considering his educational needs and age appropriate? Maybe the parents could have given him a chance to reflect, set a specific ultimatum related to his behavior, or find a way to address his resentment through counseling again. However, given the severity of the outburst, the parents might feel justified in their decision to protect their own family's well-being.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the decision might be seen as harsh but understandable given the circumstances. The parents are trying to enforce boundaries and stop the toxic behavior. However, some might argue that the stepson is still young and the punishment is too severe without a more nuanced approach. But given the extreme nature of the stepson's behavior, the parents' response could be seen as necessary. Therefore, the author (the parents) might not be in the wrong.\n"
