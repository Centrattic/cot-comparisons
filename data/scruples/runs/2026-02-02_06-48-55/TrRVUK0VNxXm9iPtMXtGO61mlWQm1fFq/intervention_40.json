From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson after he refused to join a family trip and had a meltdown. The stepson called the wife terrible names and showed resentment towards her. The author and their wife gave him 30 days to move out and cut off financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson has been living with them, funded by them, since he was 13. His behavior seems to stem from deep-seated resentment towards the wife for not providing the same as his absent father. The author and wife have tried therapy, but it didn't help. The stepson is now 19, an adult, and still acting out.\n\nThe key points are: the stepson is an adult, the author and wife made a decision together, the stepson's behavior was unacceptable (verbal abuse), and the authors are cutting financial support. The question is whether kicking him out is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the stepson's actions were disrespectful and hurtful. The parents have the right to set boundaries, especially since he's an adult. They are not obligated to support him financially if he's not contributing. On the other hand, some might argue that cutting off support abruptly could be harsh, especially if he's not ready to be independent. However, the stepson's behavior was inexcusable, and the parents are trying to enforce maturity.\n\nI think the parents are in the right here. They provided for him, he's an adult, and his actions were unacceptable. They're giving him a chance to get his act together. So the answer is B.\n"
