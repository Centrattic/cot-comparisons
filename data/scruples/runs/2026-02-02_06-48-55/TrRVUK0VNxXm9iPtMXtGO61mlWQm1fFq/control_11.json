From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their 19-year-old stepson after a confrontation. The stepson had been with them since he was 13, and there's a history of resentment towards the stepmom. The stepson was funded through college, but when asked to join a family trip, he refused and lashed out with insults. The parents decided he had to move out and stop financial support.\n\nFirst, consider the stepson's age. He's 19, which is over 18, so legally an adult. It's reasonable to expect him to contribute and eventually become independent. However, the parents have been supporting him through college. The stepson's behavior was extremely disrespectful, using harsh language towards the stepmom and the daughter. That's a big red flag. The parents had given him resources and opportunities he hadn't shown gratitude for, which led to their decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have escalated the situation too quickly by giving only 30 days. Maybe a longer timeline or some form of mediation could have been better. But the stepson's actions were inexcusable. The parents were trying to protect their own daughter and spouse from toxic behavior. They also had their own child to care for, so their decision could be seen as necessary for the household's well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the stepson's mental health. He's been in therapy, but it didn't help. The parents might not have known how to handle his long-term resentment. However, the outburst was a direct attack, which justifies their reaction.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the stepson's adult age, disrespectful actions, and the parents' need to set boundaries for their family, it's likely the parents aren't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
