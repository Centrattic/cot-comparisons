From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for kicking out their stepson after he refused to come on a family trip and insulted the wife. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepson was 13 when the wife married the author. They've been supporting him for 6 years, but he's resentful, especially towards the wife. The wife worked hard, even sacrificing her own needs, but the stepson's resentment didn't fade. Now he's in college, still lives with them, and they've been funding him. They planned a family trip to Disney, and the stepson refused to come. When confronted, he insulted the wife, called her a bitch, a whore, and made comments about the daughter. The author and wife decided to give him 30 days to move out and cut financial support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion. The key points here are: the stepson's age (19), his behavior, the family's support, and the consequences given.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider. The stepson is an adult, so maybe the family had the right to set boundaries. However, cutting off support entirely because he refused to go on a trip and made a single outburst might be harsh. But the stepson's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful, especially towards his step parent who had been supporting him. The family might feel that after years of resentment and finally an explosion, they needed to enforce consequences. On the other hand, maybe there's room for understanding, given his mental health issues and the therapist visits. But the stepson's actions were unacceptable, and the family's response might be a necessary step to protect their own well-being.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified. But is it too harsh? The stepson is still in college, so being thrown out could disrupt his education. However, he's 19, an adult, and the family might feel they've done enough. The answer hinges on whether the punishment fits the offense. The author's decision could be seen as appropriate for setting boundaries after the stepson's disrespectful behavior. Alternatively, maybe they could have handled it differently, like cutting financial support but allowing him to stay temporarily. But the immediate reaction after such insults might be understandable.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their wife and daughter, and addressing the disrespectful behavior. The stepson's actions were unacceptably cruel, and the family had the right to enforce consequences. So the answer would be B.\n"
