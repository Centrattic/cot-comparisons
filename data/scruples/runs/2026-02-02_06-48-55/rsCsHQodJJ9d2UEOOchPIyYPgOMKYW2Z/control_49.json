I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for avoiding sitting next to mentally challenged people on the bus. The person describes their behavior of placing a bag on the seat or spreading out to take up space when they see someone coming from a facility for the mentally challenged. The reasons given are loudness, hygiene issues, being unpleasant, and taking up space. Someone called them out, saying they shouldn't block seats with bags.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The key here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory or just self-preservation. The author is trying to avoid discomfort by using a common bus etiquette trick (placing a bag to reserve a seat). However, the problem is that they are doing this based on the passenger's disability status. That could be seen as discriminatory because they're avoiding people because of their mental challenges, not because the person is actually causing a problem at that moment.\n\nThe author mentions that these individuals might be loud or have hygiene issues. But those are stereotypes or assumptions. Not everyone with a mental challenge is going to be loud or have poor hygiene. By preemptively avoiding them, the author might be contributing to stigma and prejudice. Also, using space in a way that blocks others, even if with a bag, could be considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to manage their own comfort in a public space. Public transport can be challenging, and people often use similar tactics to avoid uncomfortable situations. However, the targeting of a specific group (mentally challenged individuals) for this avoidance could be problematic. It's important to differentiate between avoiding someone who is currently causing a disturbance versus avoiding someone based on their perceived characteristics.\n\nThe person who called them out is advocating for others' rights to sit wherever there's space. The author's actions, while perhaps intended to avoid discomfort, could be seen as infringing on the rights of others to sit as they please, especially if those others are not causing any immediate issue. The key here is intent and whether the action is based on prejudice.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, discrimination based on disability is generally not allowed. Even in public transport scenarios, people should not be denied space because of their disability. The author's behavior could be considered discriminatory because they are avoiding people solely based on their mental challenges, not because of any actual behavior problem at that moment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they are engaging in behavior that discriminates against a vulnerable group based on stereotypes and assumptions, rather than addressing actual issues as they arise.\n"
