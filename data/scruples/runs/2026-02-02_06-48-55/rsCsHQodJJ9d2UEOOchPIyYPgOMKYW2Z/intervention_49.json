I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to avoid sitting next to people with mental challenges on the bus. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is trying to avoid having mentally challenged individuals sit next to them by using their bag to block seats or sitting wide. They mention reasons like loudness, personal hygiene issues, taking up space, and ignoring exit cues. But someone called them out for it.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory or inappropriate. The author is specifically targeting people based on their mental condition. Even if the reasons they list are common complaints in public transport, intentionally avoiding these individuals by reserving seats could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe author's actions might not be illegal, but from an ethical standpoint, it's about treating people with respect regardless of their circumstances. The person who called them out is pointing out that it's unfair to blame the mentally challenged individuals and that reserving seats is against the purpose of public transport. \n\nAlso, the author's justification for their behavior (hygiene, noise, etc.) doesn't necessarily make it right. It's important to consider that people with mental challenges might have rights and deserve consideration in public spaces. The author's approach might be a form of ableism, which is a form of discrimination. \n\nHowever, the author does mention that they move their bag if asked. That shows some level of respect for others' needs, but the initial action of blocking seats based on someone's mental state is still problematic. \n\nIn summary, even if the author's intentions are to avoid discomfort, deliberately avoiding certain groups based on their mental condition is ethically wrong. Public transportation should be accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their circumstances. The author's behavior, while perhaps understandable in terms of personal space concerns, is discriminatory and thus in the wrong.\n"
