I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about avoiding sitting next to mentally challenged people on the bus by placing their bag on the seat or sitting wide. The person is 6'1\", so space is an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is trying to avoid discomfort due to loudness, hygiene, or space issues. But is it right to discriminate based on someone's mental challenges? That's a key point. Legally, in many places, people with disabilities have rights to access public transportation, and using space in a way that prevents them from sitting might be against anti-discrimination laws. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they move their bag if asked. That might show they're not being inconsiderate, but still, proactively blocking seats based on someone's disability is problematic. The other person called them out, which could be because they perceive it as discrimination. \n\nSocially, even if it's not illegal, it's a moral question. Is it acceptable to avoid people because of characteristics they can't control? The author's reasons are understandable, but the method might be seen as prejudiced. \n\nI should check if there are laws against this. For example, the ADA in the US requires reasonable accommodations. Blocking seats based on someone's disability could be a violation. But if the author isn't physically blocking the seat but just using their own space, maybe it's different. However, the perception is that they're avoiding the person, which is where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, the person's actions could be seen as contributing to stigma. Even if they aren't legally wrong, socially it's frowned upon. The answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because it's about discrimination and accessibility. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if it's framed as personal space. But the consensus in AITA forums usually leans towards considering discrimination and stigma, so probably A.\n"
