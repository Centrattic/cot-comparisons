I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about avoiding sitting next to mentally challenged people on the bus by using their bag to block the seat or sitting wide to limit space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is trying to avoid discomfort due to loudness, hygiene issues, or space concerns. But is that justifiable? Public transportation is a shared space, so everyone has a right to sit where there's space. Blocking a seat with a bag is a common tactic to reserve space, but is it ethical?\n\nThe key points: the author's reasons are based on personal discomfort. However, using a bag to block a seat isn't illegal, but it's a bit of a gray area. The person who called them out might be right in pointing out that others need that space too. However, the author isn't actually blocking the seat permanently; they're just making it harder to sit next to them. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are tall and take up space, which might make others uncomfortable. But the main issue is their intentional avoidance of a specific group. Even if the group is causing some issues, it's about treating everyone fairly. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory if they're targeting a specific group based on their disabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't refusing to sit next to them entirely; they're just using a common tactic to manage personal space. The problem might be more about the attitude towards the group rather than the action itself. If the author's actions are causing others to be uncomfortable, especially if the mentally challenged individuals are being excluded from seating, that's an issue.\n\nBut legally, there's no rule against placing a bag on a seat. However, ethically, it's about whether they should be doing that for the reasons stated. The person who called them out is advocating for fairness, which is a valid point. The author's reasoning could be seen as making assumptions about the group's behavior, which might not be fair either.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions are ethically questionable because they're avoiding a specific group based on stereotypes, even if their actions aren't illegal. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
