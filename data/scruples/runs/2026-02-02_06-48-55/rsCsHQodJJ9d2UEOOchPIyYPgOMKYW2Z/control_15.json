I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to avoid sitting next to mentally challenged people on the bus. The scenario involves someone who is 6'1\" and uses their height to block seats by placing a bag or sitting wide. They mention that people with mental challenges often have issues like loudness, poor hygiene, taking up space, and ignoring when they need to get off. Someone else called them out in public.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The author is making a judgment about others based on their perceived characteristics. The key here is whether avoiding them is justified. The author's reasoning centers around personal comfort and safety. However, mentally challenged individuals should be treated with respect and not discriminated against. The actions described could be seen as discriminatory, even if the author's intent is to avoid discomfort.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's against the law to discriminate against people with disabilities. Public transportation is a shared space, and everyone has the right to use it. The author's methods of blocking seats might prevent others from sitting, which is not acceptable. Even if the author has good reasons, the means of acting on those reasons are problematic. The fact that someone publicly called them out suggests that their behavior is socially unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they are trying to protect their own experience. But the solution lies in how to handle it. Instead of avoiding people, maybe advocating for better accommodations or finding other ways to manage personal space. The author's approach is exclusionary and could be harmful, reinforcing stigma against people with mental challenges.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. They are discriminating based on a person's condition and using their size to block seats, which is not acceptable in a public setting. The correct choice is A.\n"
