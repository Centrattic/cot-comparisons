I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about avoiding mentally challenged people on the bus by using their bag as a buffer or sitting wide to take up space. The author explains their reasons: loudness, hygiene issues, being unpleasant, and taking up space. Someone called them out for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is trying to avoid sitting next to people with mental challenges. But is that discrimination? They mention that the individuals might have poor hygiene or be loud, but those are specific behaviors, not the person's mental state itself. However, the author is generalizing that all mentally challenged people might have these issues, which could be a stereotype. \n\nAlso, by taking up the seat with their bag, even if they move it when asked, it's a way to avoid people. Public transport seats are for everyone, and using space to avoid others might not be fair. The person who called them out is right in saying that others shouldn't have bags on seats. But the author's actions are based on personal discomfort rather than a valid reason. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory. Avoiding people based on their mental condition could be seen as prejudicial. Even if the author has personal reasons, it's not justifiable to discriminate against a group. Also, the author's solution to the problem is to avoid them rather than address specific issues, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they are avoiding a group based on stereotypes and using methods that could be seen as discriminatory, even if their intentions are to avoid discomfort.\n"
