I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for trying to avoid sitting next to mentally challenged individuals on the bus. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is commuting on a bus that picks up people from a facility for the mentally challenged. The author notices these individuals getting on and takes actions to prevent them from sitting next to them, like putting a bag on the seat or spreading out. They mention reasons like loudness, hygiene, and space issues. However, when they get called out by someone else for doing this, they're questioning their actions.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. The key points here are discrimination, disability rights, and public transportation etiquette. The author is deliberately avoiding people with mental challenges, which could be seen as discriminatory. Even if their reasons are about personal comfort, treating people differently based on their disabilities is generally considered wrong. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the US, for example, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, which includes transportation. But this might vary by country.\n\nAlso, the author's methods\u2014using a bag to block seats\u2014could be seen as taking an empty seat, which is against standard bus etiquette. However, the ADA allows for reasonable accommodations. If the mentally challenged individuals are using the bus facility, they have the right to do so, and others can't prevent them from sitting in available seats. The author's actions might be infringing on their rights to equal access.\n\nBut there's the aspect of personal discomfort. The author mentions valid concerns like loudness and hygiene. However, these are challenges of shared public spaces. One has to tolerate a certain level of discomfort unless there's a direct threat to safety. The author's actions aren't about safety but personal preference, which isn't a valid legal or ethical justification for discrimination.\n\nThe person who called them out is pointing out that using bags to block seats is inappropriate and that others shouldn't be excluded based on such actions. The author's behavior might also contribute to a hostile environment for individuals with disabilities, making them feel unwelcome in public spaces.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't physically preventing anyone from sitting next to them. They are using available space (their own seat and personal items) to manage their own comfort. However, in public transport, the space is shared, and actions that interfere with others' access (like blocking seats) are generally frowned upon.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory and against public transportation policies that ensure equal access for all. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
