I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for avoiding sitting next to mentally challenged people on the bus. The author is trying to block seats by putting their bag there or spreading out because they find these individuals loud, have bad hygiene, take up space, and maybe ignore exit cues. They had someone call them out for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are the author's actions and their justification. The author feels uncomfortable, which is understandable, but the method they're using to avoid sitting next to others could be seen as discriminatory. Using a bag to block a seat is a common tactic people use to save space, but when it's specifically to avoid certain people, it might be problematic. \n\nMentally challenged individuals should have equal access to public transportation without being discriminated against. The author's actions could be seen as excluding them from available seating, which is not fair. Even if the author's reasons are based on personal discomfort, intentionally making space unavailable for certain people is not acceptable. \n\nHowever, the author does mention they move their bag if asked. That shows some consideration. But the initial act of blocking the seat is still an issue. The person who called them out was trying to advocate for others, which is a valid point. The author's behavior might be infringing on the rights of others to sit where they choose. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using their size and belongings to exclude others based on their mental condition. Discrimination, even if not malicious, is still wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
