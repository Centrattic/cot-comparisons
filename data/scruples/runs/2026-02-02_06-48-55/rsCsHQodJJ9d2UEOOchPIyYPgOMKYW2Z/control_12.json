I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for avoiding mentally challenged people on the bus. They live near a facility and often see people getting on. They move their bag or sit wide to take up space, maybe to avoid sitting next to someone. They mention reasons like loudness, hygiene, being unpleasant, and taking up space. Someone called them out today.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Is it wrong to avoid people because of their mental challenges? That seems discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, protects against such discrimination. So maybe the person is in the wrong for treating others differently based on their mental condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the person is trying to protect their own comfort. They're tall and use their bag to take a seat, which is a common but maybe not the best approach. If they're blocking a seat, others might need it. Also, the person who called them out was vocal, which might have been rude, but the user's actions could be seen as excluding others. \n\nBut is it their right to choose who sits next to them? In public spaces, you can't choose your neighbors, but you can occupy space. However, using a bag to block a seat is against bus rules in many places. Also, avoiding people based on their disability is not acceptable. The person's reasons (hygiene, noise) can be addressed with general courtesy, not by targeting a specific group. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their actions are discriminatory and based on stereotypes about mentally challenged individuals. They should treat everyone equally and handle any specific issues (like loudness) without avoiding an entire group.\n"
