He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was too. He speaks Italian and cooks Italian food, but the author feels like he's appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people define ethnicity through blood, others through upbringing. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, so he might feel Italian culturally. But the author is uncomfortable with him claiming Italian heritage without direct ancestry. \n\nThere's a difference between cultural appreciation and appropriation. If he's genuinely part of the community and respects the culture, it's more appreciation. But if he's just using it without connection, that's appropriation. The boyfriend's case seems a bit in between. His mother was adopted into an Italian family, so maybe he has a cultural connection through her, but not through blood. \n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. She might feel that without being ethnically Italian, he's not entitled to claim that identity. But cultural identity isn't just about blood. Some cultures value lineage, others don't. The boyfriend might see his upbringing as part of his Italian identity. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's mother being raised Italian and him growing up in an Italian neighborhood adds to his cultural exposure. He might feel it's legitimate to identify as Italian. However, the author's perspective is valid if she believes ethnicity should be based on ancestry.\n\nThe answer depends on how society views cultural identity. If the boyfriend is part of the Italian community and respects it, maybe he's not wrong. But if the author feels it's appropriative, her anger is justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing and not just superficial aspects, then maybe not. But if the author values ethnic heritage, her reaction is understandable. The key is whether the boyfriend's identity is genuine. Since he was raised in that culture, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But the author's feelings are valid. \n\nHmm, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because cultural appropriation is a real issue, but also A if considering cultural identity through upbringing. But the question is if the author is wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is legitimate in his context, then the author is wrong. If not, then she's right. It's a bit of a nuanced case. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so maybe he has a valid connection. But the author's perspective is that it's not about blood. It's a cultural issue. I think the answer is B because the boyfriend's upbringing gives him a cultural identity, so the author is not in the wrong for being upset. Wait, but the boyfriend's mother was Italian, so he's not ethnically Italian. Maybe the answer is B because the author's reaction is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
