He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their boyfriend claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian. She was bilingual and immersed in Italian culture, even living in Italy some. The boyfriend was raised in a similar household, with Italian meals, culture, and even mandatory Italian classes at school. He doesn't act stereotypically Italian but takes pride in the culture, which he was raised in.\n\nThe author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood, so they feel he's appropriating the culture. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian makes him Italian culturally. The author thinks that just speaking the language or cooking Italian food doesn't make someone Italian by blood. \n\nI need to consider cultural identity here. Some people define ethnicity by blood, others by culture. The boyfriend's case is a mix: his mother was culturally Italian through adoption, and he was raised in that environment. Culturally, he identifies as Italian because of how he was raised. But the author is focused on biological heritage. \n\nIs it valid to feel that cultural adoption isn't enough? It's a nuanced issue. Some people might argue that ethnicity is about culture and upbringing, not just genetics. Others might say that claiming an ethnicity without blood ties is appropriation. However, in this case, the boyfriend's entire upbringing and the influence from his adoptive mother's Italian background could justify his cultural identity. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from a strict view of ethnicity as blood-based. But in many cases, people adopt cultures they grow up in, especially if they're surrounded by it. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian for attention; he was raised in that culture. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. If he's genuinely part of the community and respects the culture, it might not be appropriation. \n\nSo, the author might be in the right if they believe ethnicity should be based on blood. However, the boyfriend's situation is a bit of a mix. The adoption aspect complicates things. The mother was fully immersed, and the boyfriend grew up in that environment. Culturally, he's part of Italian heritage through upbringing. Therefore, the author could be misunderstanding the concept of cultural identity. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if they value biological heritage, but the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing. The answer depends on how one defines Italian identity. Since the author is upset about the lack of blood ties despite cultural immersion, the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, considering the boyfriend's upbringing, maybe the author is being too strict. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identity is valid through culture, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. But if the author's stance is valid, then they're not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author is not in the wrong because they feel their boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage, even if that's a cultural perspective.\n"
