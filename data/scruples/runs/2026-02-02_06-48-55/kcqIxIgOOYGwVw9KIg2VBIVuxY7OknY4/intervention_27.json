He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, so he was raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing and cultural environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People can identify with a culture even without ethnic background if they were raised in that culture. The boyfriend learned Italian, cooks Italian food, and grew up in an Italian community. So, he's embracing the culture, which is different from just claiming ethnicity without any connection.\n\nThe author is upset because they think cultural appropriation is happening. But cultural appropriation usually refers to adopting elements of a culture in a harmful or insensitive way. Here, the boyfriend is part of the Italian culture in his household and community. It's more about cultural affiliation than appropriation.\n\nThe author might feel that cultural identity should be based on blood. But many cultures have people who adopt them through upbringing. For example, someone can be part of a culture through marriage or adoption. The boyfriend's identity is shaped by his environment, not just genetics. So, the author's argument that you can't be Italian without blood might be too narrow.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend clarifies he's not by blood but was raised Italian. That transparency is important. He's honest about his background but still identifies with the culture he was immersed in. The author's issue is more about personal values on cultural authenticity, which might be a matter of perspective.\n\nSo, the key points are: cultural identity can be shaped by upbringing, the boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture, and there's no harm in identifying with a culture you were raised in. The author's frustration is valid if they value ethnic ties, but the boyfriend isn't appropriating; he's part of the culture through his environment. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. Wait, the initial thought was the author is in the wrong, but after analysis, maybe not? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. Let me re-examine. The boyfriend's identification is based on his upbringing, which is a legitimate part of cultural identity. The author is upset about being ethnically Italian versus culturally. The boyfriend isn't claiming ethnic Italian heritage but cultural. So, the author's argument is based on a different definition of Italian identity. If the author believes that cultural identity requires ethnic roots, then they might feel the boyfriend is faking it. But culturally, it's acceptable to identify with a culture you were raised in. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong to feel this way, but the boyfriend isn't in the wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making a judgment about cultural authenticity based on blood, they might be misunderstanding cultural identity. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because their feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's actions aren't necessarily wrong. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is upset over something that's a matter of cultural identification, maybe they aren't wrong to feel that way, but they are in the wrong if they're being judgmental without understanding cultural nuances. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend isn't wrong either. The situation is a matter of differing perspectives on cultural identity.\n"
