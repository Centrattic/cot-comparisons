He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being blood-related. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend grew up in the same kind of environment, even with Italian education in school. He cooks Italian food, knows the language, and is part of the Italian community. But the author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian and is appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I should consider cultural identity. People often define their culture through upbringing, traditions, and environment, not just blood. If someone is raised in a specific culture, does that make them part of that culture? For example, there are cases where adoptees are raised in different cultures and identify with them. Similarly, people can adopt aspects of a culture through their environment. So the boyfriend might genuinely see himself as Italian because of how he was raised, even without the ethnicity.\n\nBut the author's issue is about cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is when someone from a dominant culture adopts elements of a marginalized culture, often without understanding or respecting it. But in this case, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture from a young age, so it's more about cultural identity than appropriation. He's not just taking bits and pieces; he was raised in it. So maybe it's not appropriation but rather cultural affiliation through upbringing.\n\nThe author is bothered because they feel he's falsely claiming an identity. But if the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and he was raised in that culture, does that make him culturally Italian? It's similar to how some people identify with their adoptive culture. However, some people might argue that ethnic identity is tied to ancestry, so even if you're raised in a culture, without the blood, it's not the same. That's a point the author is making.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"cultural legitimacy.\" Can someone be considered part of a culture if they were raised in it? For example, a child adopted into a different culture might identify with that culture. So the boyfriend's case is similar if he was raised by his adoptive mother's Italian family. However, the father is not Italian, but the mother's adoption is key here. Since his mother is part of the Italian culture through her upbringing, maybe the boyfriend's claim is more justified.\n\nBut the author's discomfort is valid. They might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry. However, the boyfriend is not pretending to be something he's not in a harmful way; he's embracing a culture that was part of his upbringing. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. The boyfriend isn't mocking or stereotyping but is living the culture as it was taught to him.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the boyfriend's identity is legitimate through upbringing, then the author's anger might be unfounded. But if the author believes that cultural identity must have ethnic roots, they have a valid point. The answer depends on the perspective of cultural identity. In many discussions, cultural identity includes both ancestry and upbringing. Since the boyfriend's upbringing was deeply Italian, his claim might be acceptable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being angry about this.\n"
