He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he's not. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author feels that even though he was raised that way, he doesn't have Italian blood and is appropriating the culture.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about cultural identity. The boyfriend is claiming Italian identity based on upbringing and environment, not blood. The author argues that just because he can cook and speak Italian doesn't make him Italian. But culture isn't always about blood. People can adopt cultures through upbringing, environment, and personal connection.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because he's presenting himself as Italian when he doesn't have heritage. But if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, especially through family and community, it's common for them to identify with that culture. The boyfriend's case is a bit of a grey area. His mother was raised Italian, so he was too. The father's background isn't known, but the mother's adoption into an Italian family is significant. \n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. They feel he's not genuine in claiming the culture. But cultural identity can be complex. If someone grows up in a culture, they might feel a legitimate connection to it. However, there's also the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. If he's taking the culture without the heritage, some might see that as appropriation. But others might argue that if he was raised in that culture, it's part of his identity.\n\nSo, where does the blame lie? The author is upset, but is that valid? It could depend on context. If the boyfriend is being insincere or mocking, that's different. But here, he seems to have grown up in an Italian environment. The author's anger might be about the lack of biological ties, but cultural identity isn't solely about biology. So, the author might be overstepping by judging his cultural identity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not accepting his cultural upbringing as legitimate, even if it's not through blood. Answer B.\n"
