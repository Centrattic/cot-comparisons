He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether their boyfriend is appropriating Italian culture because he doesn't have Italian blood, even though he was raised in an Italian household. The author is upset that he claims to be Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions here. Cultural appropriation is generally when someone adopts elements of a culture that is not their own, especially from a marginalized group, often in ways that are disrespectful or dismissive of the original culture. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household. His mother was adopted into an Italian family and grew up Italian. The boyfriend was also raised in that environment, learned Italian, and has Italian friends. So he's been immersed in Italian culture since childhood.\n\nNow, does cultural identity require biological heritage? I think many people identify with a culture based on upbringing rather than blood. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with that culture. So, if you're raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks the food, and has the cultural practices, it's reasonable for them to identify as Italian culturally, even if they don't have Italian ancestry. \n\nThe author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. But nationality and ethnic identity can be complex. In many countries, you can be considered part of the culture based on how you were raised. For instance, in Italy, someone's citizenship might not make them Italian by culture, but cultural identity can be adopted. So if he was raised Italian, he might consider himself Italian by cultural upbringing.\n\nHowever, the key point is the authenticity of his claim. If he's presenting as ethnically Italian or claiming ancestry he doesn't have, that's different. But if he's saying he was raised Italian and has the cultural practices, that might be acceptable. The problem arises if he's pretending to have ancestry for some reason. But according to the story, his mother's adoption into an Italian family led to his upbringing. So the boyfriend's parents are not Italian by blood, but he was raised in that culture.\n\nThe author is upset because he's appropriating the culture. But if he was raised in it, is that appropriation or genuine cultural identification? Cultural appropriation is more about taking elements from a culture without being part of it, often in a way that's offensive or trivializing. In this case, he's been part of the culture his whole life, so it's more like cultural identity based on upbringing rather than appropriation. \n\nAnother angle: the author might feel that being Italian is about bloodline. But many cultures have people who adopt the culture without being of that ethnicity. So maybe the author is being overly rigid about what it means to be \"Italian.\" If the boyfriend has a strong connection to Italian culture through his upbringing, then it's valid for him to identify with that culture. The author's issue is more about authenticity in terms of heritage versus cultural practice.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he's not by blood but by upbringing. That seems reasonable because cultural identity isn't solely about blood. However, if the boyfriend is using this to claim something he isn't, like ethnic heritage, then that's different. But the story doesn't indicate he's pretending to be ethnically Italian, just culturally. The author might be overreacting because the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is similar to an Italian upbringing, even if the bloodline isn't there.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid based on his upbringing. The author's anger could stem from a misunderstanding of what constitutes cultural identity. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend is appropriating a culture he isn't part of ethnically, but wait, if he was raised in it, is it appropriation? Wait, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the boyfriend's identification is based on upbringing, which is legitimate. But the author is upset because he doesn't have blood ties. But cultural identity isn't about blood. So the author is in the wrong for being upset about something that's not necessarily appropriation if he was raised that way. Hmm, this is tricky. I need to decide whether cultural identity based on upbringing is sufficient for claiming that culture, even without blood ties. If so, the author is in the wrong for being angry. If not, then the author isn't. But in many cases, people do identify with a culture they were raised in, even if not by blood. So maybe B is correct because the author is wrong to be upset.\n"
