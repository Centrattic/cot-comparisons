He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author is upset with their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood, learned Italian in school, and was raised with Italian culture. He cooks Italian food, socializes with Italians, and identifies as Italian, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture because he has no actual Italian ancestry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People often identify with the culture they were raised in, even if they don't have direct ancestry. The boyfriend's mother was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, so it's part of her identity. Her son was raised in that environment, so he's been surrounded by Italian traditions, language, and customs. That seems like a legitimate basis for cultural identity.\n\nThe author is upset because they think you can't be Italian without blood. But cultural identity isn't always about genetics. Many people adopt the culture of their upbringing. For example, someone raised in a Korean household might identify as Korean even if they have no Korean ancestors. The boyfriend's case seems similar. He's not trying to erase others' experiences but is part of a cultural environment that shaped him.\n\nAppropriation is a sensitive topic. Cultural appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, often in a harmful or stereotypical way. Here, the boyfriend is deeply involved in Italian culture\u2014speaking the language, cooking the food, living in an Italian community. This seems more like cultural affiliation through upbringing rather than appropriation.\n\nThe author's main issue is with the claim of being Italian without blood. However, many people's identities are based on heritage, not just DNA. The boyfriend's mother's story is that she was raised Italian, so her son naturally grew up with that. The author's frustration might stem from a strict view that ethnicity is determined solely by ancestry, which isn't how cultural identity works in many cases.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way; he's just being proud of the culture he knows. The author might be projecting their own strict definition onto the situation. The boyfriend's identity is valid because it's based on lived experience. The author's anger could be about something deeper, like not valuing cultural identity beyond bloodlines, which might be a personal issue rather than the boyfriend being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're dismissing the boyfriend's cultural identity based on a narrow definition that doesn't account for upbringing and environment. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no\u2014wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but the analysis suggests the opposite. Wait, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The analysis suggests the author is wrong to be upset. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, the options are A for Yes (author in the wrong) and B for No (not in wrong). If the author is wrong to be angry, then A is correct. But I need to make sure.\n\nThe key points: The boyfriend's cultural identity is valid because he was raised in that culture. The author is being judgmental about what constitutes being Italian. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
