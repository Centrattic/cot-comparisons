He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian, even though he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and was taught Italian. He identifies as Italian culturally, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset because he's claiming a cultural identity without biological ties, and she feels it's appropriation.\n\nNow, the key points here are cultural identity versus ethnic origin. Cultural identity can be formed through upbringing, language, traditions, etc., even without biological ties. The boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture and identifies with it, which some might argue is valid. However, the author's issue is with the appropriation aspect\u2014when someone adopts elements of a culture without being part of it, potentially disrespecting the culture or its people.\n\nBut cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It often involves power dynamics and insensitivity. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in that culture by his adoptive Italian family, so it's more of a cultural upbringing rather than appropriation. The line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If he's genuinely part of that culture through upbringing, does it count as cultural identity?\n\nThe author feels wronged because he's claiming Italian identity without blood. But cultural identity isn't always about blood. However, if the boyfriend is not actually of Italian descent, is it misleading? The author might feel he's taking credit for a heritage he doesn't have, which could be seen as insincere.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's identity is shaped by his environment and upbringing. People can identify with cultures they're raised in. The question is whether the author's anger is justified. If the boyfriend is respectful and part of the culture through his upbringing, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the boyfriend is using it in a way that's superficial or inauthentic, then the author might have a valid point.\n\nCultural identity is complex. Some argue that you can have a cultural identity without ethnic ties if you were raised in that culture. Others might say that biological heritage is necessary. The boyfriend's case is a mix of both\u2014his mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he grew up with Italian traditions but doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community would look at whether the author is being unreasonable. If the boyfriend is living the culture and identifying with it, the author's anger might be seen as petty. However, if the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage for some benefit, that's different. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, so he might feel that's valid.\n\nI think the author's right to be upset is debatable. Cultural identity can be self-determined, but there might be a boundary when someone is using it in a way that's not authentic. However, since the boyfriend's upbringing is deeply immersed in Italian culture, it's a gray area. The answer would depend on cultural sensitivity and whether the boyfriend's claims are in good faith. Since the boyfriend isn't acting stereotypically and is respectful, maybe the author is being too strict. But the author's feelings are valid too. However, in AITA contexts, if the person is not harming anyone and is culturally immersed, the answer might lean towards the author being the asshole. Alternatively, if the author's issue is about blood-based identity, that's a personal issue. So, the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) or A (author is in the wrong). Hmm, I need to decide.\n"
