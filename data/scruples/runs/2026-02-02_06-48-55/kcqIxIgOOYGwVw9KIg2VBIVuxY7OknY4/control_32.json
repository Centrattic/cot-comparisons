He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family, and she was raised Italian. He grew up in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian in school. The author is upset because he says he's Italian without any blood relation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. If someone is raised in a culture, even without biological ties, do they have the right to identify with that culture? Like, if a person is adopted into a culture and grows up with its traditions, language, and practices, is that enough for them to be part of that culture?\n\nThen there's the concept of appropriation versus appreciation. The author feels it's appropriation because he doesn't have Italian blood. But if he's been immersed in the culture his whole life, maybe it's more about cultural appreciation. However, the line between the two can be blurry. Appropriation often has negative connotations when someone takes elements of a culture without respecting its origins or when it's done insensitively.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which could mean that his cultural upbringing is significant. But the author argues that blood relation matters here. There's a debate about whether cultural identity should be based on heritage or lived experience.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically Italian, which might mitigate the issue. He's not mocking or caricaturing, just identifying with a culture he grew up in. But the author's issue is that he's claiming an identity that isn't biologically rooted, which might be a personal boundary for her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Some might say cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing, others might think bloodline is necessary. The author's feelings are valid if she values ethnic heritage, but the boyfriend's experience as being raised in that culture is also valid. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way. Since cultural identity can be complex and personal, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having that perspective. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check the nuances again.\n\nWait, but if the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian cultural community through upbringing, even without blood, maybe it's not appropriation. Cultural appropriation often involves using aspects of a culture without understanding or respecting it, which doesn't seem to be the case here. He's immersed and takes pride in it. The author's issue is more about biological heritage, which might not be the main point. So the author's anger might be based on a personal preference rather than the boyfriend doing something objectively wrong. Therefore, the answer could be B.\n"
