He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household. The author is upset because he says he's Italian even without blood ties.\n\nFirst, I need to think about cultural identity. People can identify with a culture even if they don't have blood. For example, someone raised in a certain culture might adopt the language, traditions, food, etc. So the boyfriend might see himself as Italian because of his upbringing. But the author feels he's appropriating the culture because there's no blood relation. \n\nBut wait, cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. Appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, especially when it's a dominant group taking from a marginalized one. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and participates in the culture. That's more like cultural integration than appropriation. Maybe the author is conflating identity with ethnicity. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's family has deep ties to Italian culture, even if biologically he's not Italian. His mother was raised that way, and he grew up in it. So he might genuinely identify as Italian culturally. The author is upset about the blood relation, but in many cultures, cultural identification isn't solely based on genetics. \n\nThe author's issue seems to be about authenticity of identity. But if someone is immersed in a culture from childhood, isn't that a valid way to identify? The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language, living in an Italian neighborhood) support his cultural connection. The author's anger might stem from a belief that ethnicity is only about bloodline, which isn't always how identity works. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong for invalidating his cultural identity based on biology when he has a strong cultural connection. Alternatively, maybe not, if she feels he's misrepresenting himself. But the line between cultural pride and appropriation can be blurry. Since the boyfriend was raised in the culture, it's more about personal identity. Therefore, the author's anger might be misplaced. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know. Let me recheck. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend's identity is valid, then the author is wrong to be angry. If the boyfriend is faking it, then the author has a point. But the scenario says his mother was raised Italian, so his upbringing is genuine. So he's not faking it. Hence, the author is in the wrong for thinking he's faking. Therefore, answer A? Wait, the options are A for author in the wrong, B for not. If the author is wrong to be angry, then A is correct. \n\nWait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But maybe that's the opposite of what's right. Let me think again. The author is upset that the boyfriend claims to be Italian without blood. If cultural identity is valid, then the author is wrong to be angry. So the author is in the wrong for being angry. Therefore, answer A. But maybe the answer is B. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is whether cultural identity can be claimed without blood. If yes, then the author is wrong. If not, the author is right. In many cases, cultural identity isn't about blood. So the boyfriend's identification is valid. Therefore, the author is wrong to be angry. Answer A.\n"
