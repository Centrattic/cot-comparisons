He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. So, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, and he was raised in an Italian household. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in even if they don't have blood ties. So, the boyfriend sees himself as Italian because of his upbringing. But the author is upset because she thinks you need blood to claim the culture. \n\nNow, I should consider both sides. On one hand, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people adopt and identify with cultures different from their ethnic background. The boyfriend's family was immersed in Italian culture for generations, so it's part of his heritage. On the other hand, the author feels it's appropriation because there's no biological connection. But cultural appropriation usually involves power imbalances and disrespect, which might not be the case here. He's celebrating the culture he grew up in.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, being part of the community\u2014show a deep connection. The author's issue is about authenticity based on blood. However, cultural identity can be about lived experience. The boyfriend's identity is shaped by his environment and upbringing, not just genetics. \n\nBut is the author justified in being upset? Maybe she feels that without blood ties, he's not fully part of the culture. However, many people in similar situations identify with the culture they were raised in. Unless the boyfriend is mocking or disrespecting the culture, it's more about personal identity. The author might feel her perspective is valid, but it's a cultural sensitivity issue rather than a right or wrong.\n\nIn the end, the boyfriend is expressing his cultural identity as he sees fit. The author's anger might stem from a different view on what constitutes cultural belonging. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because her feelings are valid, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong in claiming his cultural identity based on upbringing.\n"
