He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their boyfriend claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels that he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to understand cultural identity. Cultural identity can come from various sources like upbringing, language, traditions, etc. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. So even without blood, he's immersed in the culture. But the author thinks that just because he can cook Italian doesn't make him Italian. \n\nBut then, cultural identity isn't just about blood. Many people identify with a culture through upbringing. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture even if they have no genetic ties. So the boyfriend's claiming Italian identity based on his upbringing could be valid. \n\nThe author is upset because they think he's faking it. They argue that without blood, it's appropriation. But cultural appropriation is usually about using elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, often from a dominant group taking from a marginalized one. Here, the boyfriend was raised in that culture, so it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's family history is complicated. His mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he has a connection through her. The fact that his mother was raised Italian and he was too might give him a legitimate claim to the culture, even if not by blood. \n\nThe author's issue is more about authenticity and blood relation. But cultures are diverse and can be adopted through various means. So, the boyfriend's claim to being Italian based on upbringing and environment is a valid form of cultural identity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting that cultural identity isn't strictly tied to genetics. However, it's a nuanced issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, the author's anger might be misplaced. Alternatively, if the author feels it's inauthentic, but the boyfriend's identity is real to him, then the author's perspective is problematic. \n\nI think the key point is that cultural identity isn't solely determined by blood. So the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the validity of cultural identity through upbringing. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because maybe there's a valid point in the author's concern about appropriation versus genuine cultural connection. Wait, no. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture, then the author's issue might be unfounded. Hmm. I need to decide between A and B. \n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author isn't. The scenario is complex. The boyfriend's connection is through upbringing. The author is upset that he's claiming a culture without blood. But many people identify with a culture through upbringing. So the author's anger might be based on a misunderstanding of what constitutes cultural identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because they're dismissing a valid cultural identity. Or maybe not. Maybe the author has a right to feel that the boyfriend is being dishonest. It's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of cultural identity, the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. So the author is wrong to be upset. Therefore, answer B (the author is not in the wrong) or A (author is in the wrong). \n\nWait, the options are: A for Yes (author is in the wrong), B for No (author isn't in the wrong). If the author is in the wrong, that means the answer is A. If the author is not in the wrong, then B. \n\nSince cultural identity can be based on upbringing, the author is wrong to be upset. So the answer would be A. But wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Let me recheck. \n\nThe user's reasoning: The author is upset because the boyfriend claims to be Italian without blood. But if the boyfriend was raised in Italian culture, then his identity is valid. Therefore, the author is wrong to be angry. So answer A (author is in the wrong). But the options are A for \"Yes (author is in the wrong)\" and B for \"No (author is not in the wrong)\". So if the author is in the wrong, answer A. If they are not, answer B. \n\nIn this case, the author is in the wrong because they're invalidating the boyfriend's cultural identity. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
