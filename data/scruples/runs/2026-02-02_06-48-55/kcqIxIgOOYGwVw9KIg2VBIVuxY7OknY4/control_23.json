He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household. The key points here are about cultural identity and appropriation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's family raised him in an Italian environment, with language, food, and traditions. He doesn't act stereotypically, but he does identify as Italian. The author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood. \n\nCultural identity isn't solely based on ancestry. Many people adopt cultures through upbringing, even if they don't have blood ties. For example, adopted children take on their adoptive family's culture. So the boyfriend's claim as Italian could be valid because he was immersed in that culture from a young age. \n\nHowever, the author is upset because she believes only those with Italian heritage can claim the culture. This is a common debate around cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, it's appreciation. But if he's using it to fake an identity without the background, it could be seen as appropriation. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which might be true. But the author feels he's claiming it without the blood, which is a valid concern. The line between cultural connection and appropriation can be blurry. The boyfriend's actions, like cooking and speaking Italian, might be seen as embracing the culture he was raised in, not just appropriating it. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. She might feel that cultural identity should be based on heritage. But in many cases, especially with adoption and multicultural upbringings, identity is more about how you were raised. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's claim could be legitimate, making the author in the wrong for being angry. But if the boyfriend is using it to deceive or for superficial reasons, the author's concern is justified. The situation hinges on intent and the boyfriend's genuine connection to the culture. Since he was raised in it, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the boyfriend is exploiting the culture without a deep connection, then the author has a point. \n\nI think the key is whether the boyfriend's identification as Italian is authentic. If he's been part of that culture his whole life, then it's not appropriation. The author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of cultural identity. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is valid due to upbringing, then the author is in the wrong. But if cultural identity requires blood ties, which it often doesn't, then the author's feelings are valid. This is tricky. \n\nIn many cases, especially in multicultural contexts, people can adopt a culture's identity without blood. So the boyfriend's assertion as Italian is acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. Answer A. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: cultural appropriation is when someone from a dominant culture adopts elements from a marginalized culture. If the boyfriend is part of the culture through upbringing, it's not appropriation. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
