He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was raised similarly, even though he has no actual Italian ancestry. He takes pride in the culture, cooks Italian food, and uses the Italian identity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity versus blood relation. In many cases, people identify with a culture they were raised in, even without genetic ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. However, the author feels that without a drop of Italian blood, he's appropriating the culture. The boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, which is a valid way to identify.\n\nNext, the question is about appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If someone is genuinely part of a culture in terms of upbringing and community, it's not the same as someone who uses aspects of the culture superficially without connection. The boyfriend seems deeply embedded in the Italian culture through his upbringing, language, and community. So maybe the author's issue is more about blood relation rather than cultural identity.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language, being part of the community) show a strong cultural connection. The author's frustration comes from the lack of \"blood\" connection. But culturally, identity is often about how you were raised and how you live, not just genetics. However, some might argue that claiming a heritage without biological ties could be seen as misleading, especially if it's important to others.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend isn't caricaturing the culture; he's genuinely living it. The key here is whether the author's issue is about the right to identify with a culture based on upbringing versus blood. If the boyfriend grew up in an Italian household and identifies that way, it's a legitimate cultural identity. The author might be conflating ethnicity (which is often tied to ancestry) with cultural identity (which can be adopted). \n\nBut some people place importance on blood ties for ethnic identity. The author might feel that the boyfriend is being deceptive in claiming an Italian heritage when he has none, even if he was raised in that culture. This could lead to feelings of being misrepresented or disingenuous. However, others might say that cultural identity isn't about blood and that the boyfriend is being authentic to his upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the boyfriend's identity is based on upbringing and community, then he's not in the wrong for identifying as Italian. The author's issue is more about genetic heritage, which might not be the right basis for cultural identity. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if we prioritize cultural appropriation and blood ties, but if we consider cultural upbringing as valid, then maybe A (Yes). However, given that the boyfriend was raised in the culture and isn't superficially appropriating, the answer leans towards B.\n"
