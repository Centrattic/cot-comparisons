He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian but isn't of Italian descent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in that environment, learned Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and is appropriating the culture.\n\nSo, the main question is whether cultural identity can be based on upbringing rather than blood. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian is enough for him to claim that identity. The author disagrees, thinking that just speaking the language or cooking the food doesn't make someone Italian.\n\nHmm. I know that identity is complex. Some people might feel that cultural affiliation isn't solely about blood but about how you were raised and how you connect to the culture. On the other hand, the author's frustration is valid if they feel the boyfriend is pretending to be something he's not, which could be seen as cultural appropriation in some contexts.\n\nBut cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It's not always about race or ethnicity. In this case, the boyfriend is white and raised in an Italian household. Some might argue that if he's embraced the culture and lives it, he has a right to identify as Italian. Others might think only those with heritage can claim that identity.\n\nI should consider the boyfriend's perspective. He was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, so he might genuinely identify as Italian. The author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But in many cases, people identify with a culture they were exposed to without biological ties. For example, someone raised in a multicultural household might identify with multiple cultures.\n\nHowever, the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If the boyfriend is being respectful and has a deep connection to the culture, it's more appreciation. But if he's using it to pretend to be part of a group he's not ethnically connected to, the author's discomfort makes sense.\n\nThe key here is the intent and the impact. The author feels wronged because the boyfriend is claiming an identity that the author doesn't believe he can authentically hold. The boyfriend's justification is that upbringing is enough. \n\nI think the author's feelings are valid. Cultural identity can be personal, and if one person's cultural background is fabricated in a way that the other finds offensive, that's a legitimate issue. But whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on how we view cultural identity. If society allows people to identify with a culture they were raised in, even without blood ties, then the author might be overreacting. However, if the author feels it's deceptive or disrespectful, that's a different angle.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The boyfriend's claim to Italian identity might be based on lived experience, but the author has a right to be upset if they feel he's appropriating a culture. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong, but the author's perspective is valid, so answer B (No).\n"
