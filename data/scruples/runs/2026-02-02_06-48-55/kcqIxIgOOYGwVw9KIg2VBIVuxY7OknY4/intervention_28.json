He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and grew up in an Italian household. The boyfriend was raised in a similar environment, learned Italian, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian and even speaks the language. The author feels that since he doesn't have Italian blood, he's appropriating the culture.\n\nI know that cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have direct blood ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household by his mother, so he might see himself as Italian culturally. But the author disagrees, thinking that cultural identity requires blood relation.\n\nBut wait, in many cases, culture isn't just about blood. It's about upbringing, language, traditions, etc. The boyfriend's family environment and education (mandatory Italian until grade 8) shaped his identity. So, if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, isn't that a valid way to identify?\n\nHowever, the author is upset because they think you need blood to be part of the culture. That might be a misunderstanding. Cultural appropriation is usually about someone from a dominant culture adopting elements of a marginalized culture in a way that's disrespectful. But here, the boyfriend was raised in that culture, so maybe it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian. The author thinks that's not enough. So the conflict is about what defines cultural identity. If the boyfriend's upbringing and environment are enough for him to identify as Italian, then the author's anger might be misplaced. But if the author values blood relation, they might feel he's faking it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to feel this way. But is it wrong to be angry about it? Maybe not. However, the boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian for superficial reasons but because of his upbringing. The author might need to accept that cultural identity can be formed through environment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend's identity is legitimate due to his upbringing, then the author might be overreacting. But if the author's perspective is that only blood matters, they might not be wrong in their feelings, but their reaction could be based on a narrow view of cultural identity.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be based on upbringing rather than blood. Since it can, the author might be in the wrong for being angry. But if they have a different perspective, maybe not. But generally, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
