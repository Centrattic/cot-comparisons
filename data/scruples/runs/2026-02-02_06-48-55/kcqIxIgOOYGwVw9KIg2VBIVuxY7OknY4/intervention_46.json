He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian, but he himself has no Italian blood. The author feels that cultural appropriation is happening here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Being raised in a culture doesn't always equate to ethnicity. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture, learned the language, and even has a background through his mother. But the author argues that claiming Italian heritage without the ethnic blood is appropriation. \n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It's about adopting elements of a culture without being part of it, often in ways that are disrespectful or trivializing. However, in this case, the boyfriend is deeply involved in the culture through upbringing, language, and community. His mother was raised in an Italian household, so maybe he's part of a cultural legacy through her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's issue is that he claims Italian identity without biological ties. Some might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about blood, but about how you were raised and how you identify. Others might say that without the heritage, it's appropriation. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, connecting with the community\u2014could be seen as genuine cultural engagement. The problem arises when the author feels he's falsely claiming that identity. But is it wrong to embrace a culture you were raised in, even if not ethnically? \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response that he was \"raised Italian\" might be valid. In many cases, people adopt the culture they were raised in, especially if it's deeply ingrained. However, the author's discomfort stems from the lack of ethnic connection, which is a cultural identity issue. \n\nI need to consider if the boyfriend is appropriating versus embracing. If he's part of the Italian community through upbringing and practices, maybe it's not appropriation. But if he's using it to create a false ethnic identity, that's different. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here.\n\nThe author might be in the right if the boyfriend is using the culture for personal identity without respecting its origins. But if the boyfriend has a genuine connection through upbringing, maybe the author's anger is misplaced. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I'm leaning towards B (No), because cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend's upbringing in an Italian household with language and practices might justify his cultural identity, even without ethnic ties. The author's concern about appropriation could be valid, but the boyfriend's deep engagement with the culture might make his claim legitimate from a cultural standpoint. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation isn't black and white.\n"
