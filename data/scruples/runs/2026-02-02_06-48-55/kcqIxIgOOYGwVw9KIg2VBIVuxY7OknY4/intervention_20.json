He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he grew up in an Italian household, speaking the language and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cultural aspects here. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian environment, which probably influenced his identity. The author is upset because he doesn't have actual Italian ancestry. But does cultural upbringing count as being part of that culture? That's a common debate. For example, people can grow up in a culture different from their ancestry and identify with it. So maybe he's not appropriating but rather embracing the culture he was raised in.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. They think you can't claim a culture without the bloodline. But many cultures are defined by more than just ethnicity. Language, food, traditions, and upbringing are significant parts. If the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture, he might legitimately consider himself Italian in a cultural sense, even without the heritage. \n\nHowever, the author feels it's appropriation. Cultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. But if someone is raised within a culture, especially if it's a significant part of their upbringing, it's more about assimilation or cultural identity. The line between appropriation and appreciation isn't always clear. If the boyfriend is respectful and part of the community, maybe it's not appropriation.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's family history adds complexity. His mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised that way. So his connection to Italian culture is through his mother's upbringing. That could be seen as a valid cultural heritage, even if not biologically tied. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from personal values about cultural identity. But others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. So is the author wrong for being upset? It's possible they have a valid concern if the boyfriend is being disingenuous, but if he's genuinely part of the culture through his environment, the author's reaction might be unwarranted.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's right to feel this way is valid, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural perspectives. If the boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing and not pretending to have ancestry, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the boyfriend is falsely claiming heritage, then the author isn't wrong. The key is how the boyfriend presents his identity. If he says he's Italian because of upbringing and not by blood, maybe the author is being too strict. But if he's implying he has actual Italian blood, the author's anger makes sense. The answer hinges on how the boyfriend is framing his identity. Since the boyfriend says he's raised Italian but not by blood, the author's issue is about the claim without the heritage. In that case, the author might be in the right to feel upset if the boyfriend's claims are misleading. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is clear about his cultural upbringing, the author's reaction could be seen as unnecessary. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is different. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering cultural identity and upbringing, the author's position might not be the wrong one. Wait, but the boyfriend is raised in that culture, so maybe he's entitled to identify as Italian culturally. Therefore, the author's anger is misplaced. So answer B (not in the wrong) or A (in the wrong)? If the boyfriend is not misrepresenting his heritage but only his cultural upbringing, then the author is wrong to be angry. But if the boyfriend is claiming heritage he doesn't have, then the author isn't wrong. The article says the boyfriend claims to be Italian, takes pride in the family, etc. But his mother's adoption. So he doesn't have Italian ancestry. If he's claiming to be Italian by heritage, then it's false. But if he's claiming cultural upbringing, it's valid. The answer depends on whether claiming cultural identity without heritage is acceptable. Many people argue that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. So the author's issue might be based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A.\n"
