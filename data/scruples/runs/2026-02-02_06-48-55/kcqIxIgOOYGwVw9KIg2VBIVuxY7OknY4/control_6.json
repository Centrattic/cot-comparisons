He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in that culture, but he himself doesn't have Italian blood. He's raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing, even without ethnic ties. Italy has a history of diaspora and diverse regions, so cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend might see his identity as valid because of his upbringing and environment. However, the author feels that cultural appropriation is happening because he's not ethnically Italian. \n\nCultural appropriation vs. appreciation is a key point here. If he's genuinely immersed in the culture and respects it, it's more appreciation. But if he's using it to feign an identity he doesn't have, that's appropriation. The author's issue is that he's claiming to be Italian without the ethnic background. \n\nOn the other hand, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people adopt cultures through upbringing. For example, someone raised in a household practicing another culture might feel that's part of their identity. However, the author's discomfort is valid if she feels he's being dishonest or dismissive when she brings it up. \n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian suggests he values the culture he was brought up in. But if the author feels he's misrepresenting himself, especially in social contexts, that could be a point of contention. The question is whether it's acceptable to identify with a culture without ethnic ties. \n\nIn some cases, people in multicultural societies adopt multiple cultures. However, if the boyfriend is using Italian identity as a primary or false claim without acknowledging the adoption angle, that could be problematic. The author's anger stems from feeling that he's faking it, which might be a deeper issue about authenticity in relationships.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If cultural identity can be based on upbringing, then maybe not. But if the boyfriend is being deceptive about his heritage, the author's concern is valid. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. The key is whether the boyfriend's actions cause harm, like erasing the actual Italian community or being inauthentic. If he's just embracing the culture he was raised in, it's appreciation. But if he's pretending to have a heritage he doesn't, it's appropriation. The answer hinges on the authenticity of his claim and the impact on the author's feelings.\n"
