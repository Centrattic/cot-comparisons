He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so the boyfriend grew up in that environment too. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and participates in the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture not just through blood but through upbringing and environment. The boyfriend was raised Italian, so culturally he might see himself as part of that identity. The author is upset because she thinks you need blood to be Italian. But in many cases, cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. For example, someone adopted into a family can adopt the culture of their adoptive family.\n\nThen there's the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. The boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture, so it's more about appreciation. Cultural appropriation usually refers to adopting elements of a culture in a disrespectful way, but here it seems like a genuine upbringing. The boyfriend isn't mocking or stereotyping; he's living the culture through his environment.\n\nThe author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But nationality and ethnicity can be complex. If someone is raised in a specific cultural environment, they might identify with that culture regardless of their biological heritage. The boyfriend's case is similar to someone being adopted and taking on their adoptive family's heritage.\n\nHowever, there might be personal reasons why the author is upset. Maybe she feels he's being inauthentic or that it's important to her that cultural identity is based on ancestry. But from a broader perspective, cultural identity isn't always about blood. So, the author's anger might stem from a personal belief rather than a wrongdoing by the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's honest about his upbringing and not pretending to have Italian ancestry, then he's not being deceptive. The author's frustration might be about different views on what constitutes cultural identity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because she's holding a different standard than how cultural identity is generally perceived.\n"
