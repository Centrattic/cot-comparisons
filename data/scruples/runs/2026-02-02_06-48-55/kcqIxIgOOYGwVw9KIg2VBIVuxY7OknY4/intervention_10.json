He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset about this cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He grew up in a predominantly Italian area, learned Italian in school, and his mother was very Italian. He cooks Italian food and takes pride in that culture. The author feels he's faking being Italian because there's no actual blood relation.\n\nThe boyfriend responds by saying he was raised Italian, not by blood. So the author is upset about cultural appropriation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nI should consider cultural identity. Some people argue that culture is more than just blood\u2014it's about upbringing, practices, and community. If someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, they might identify with it even without ancestry. On the other hand, others might see it as appropriation if there's no ancestral link, especially if the person is taking credit for a culture they don't biologically belong to.\n\nThe boyfriend's case is a bit different because his mother was raised in that culture. So even though he's not directly related, his upbringing was influenced by his mother's adoption into an Italian family. That might mean he has a legitimate cultural connection through his mother's upbringing. But the author is still upset because he doesn't have blood ties.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, cultural identity can be complex. If the boyfriend isn't trying to pass as Italian with racial aspects but is embracing the culture he was raised in, some might see that as valid. However, if the author feels it's appropriation, that's a valid concern. But maybe the author is being overly sensitive. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian in a racial sense but is part of the culture through upbringing. In that case, the author's anger might be misplaced.\n\nAlternatively, the author might have a point if the boyfriend is using the identity in a way that's dismissive of the actual cultural background. But without more context on how he uses it, it's hard to say. The key is whether the boyfriend's identification is genuine based on his upbringing. Since he was raised in that culture, even if not by blood, it's part of his identity. The author's issue is about authenticity through blood, which might not be the only measure of cultural identity.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the boyfriend's cultural identity is legitimate through upbringing. But others might argue the opposite. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be A if the author is wrong to be angry, or B if not. Based on the reasoning, the boyfriend's cultural upbringing could justify his identity, so the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
