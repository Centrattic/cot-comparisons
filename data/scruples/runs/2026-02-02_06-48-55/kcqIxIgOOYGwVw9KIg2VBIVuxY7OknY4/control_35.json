He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is upset because their boyfriend claims to be Italian, but he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household. The boyfriend cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and spends time with Italians. However, the author feels that just being raised in an Italian environment doesn't make someone Italian by blood, and they're upset about the cultural appropriation aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People can identify with a culture based on upbringing, even without genetic ties. The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so he was too. That's a valid cultural background. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. Is that a valid concern?\n\nCultural identity is complex. Some people value ethnicity (blood) while others value culture (upbringing, practices). The boyfriend is claiming Italian identity based on his upbringing, which is a common way people self-identify. However, the author might feel that without the genetic link, it's appropriation. But appropriation is usually about power dynamics and context. If the boyfriend is celebrating a culture he's connected to through upbringing, is that appropriation or appreciation?\n\nThe boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically; he's just proud of his cultural environment. The author's issue is that he doesn't have the blood. Is that the author's problem to have? Maybe the author has a different view on cultural identity. But is the boyfriend wrong for claiming Italian identity if his family raised him that way?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he's raised Italian. If he's not pretending to be ethnically Italian but culturally, maybe that's acceptable. The author's anger could stem from a personal belief about what makes someone part of a culture. But if the boyfriend isn't denying his actual heritage (his mother's adoption), just identifying with the culture he was raised in, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author's issue is about blood vs. culture. In many cases, cultural identity isn't about genetics. Unless there's fraud or deception (like claiming Italian heritage for citizenship, etc.), the boyfriend's self-identification is his right. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting blood ties for cultural identity. Alternatively, if the author feels strongly about it, they might need to discuss this with the boyfriend, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong in claiming the culture he was raised in. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but wait, the question is whether the AUTHOR is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is just claiming cultural identity, the author's anger could be unwarranted. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, no, the options are A for author in the wrong, B for not. If the author is upset over cultural appropriation where the boyfriend is actually connected to the culture through upbringing, maybe the author is being overly strict. But cultural appropriation is a real issue, but this might be appreciation. If the boyfriend is part of an Italian community and practices the culture, he's not appropriating. So the author's anger might be misplaced. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A), or not? This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, the boyfriend's connection is through his mother's upbringing. So he's part of that cultural milieu. The author's issue is about blood, but culture isn't only about blood. So the author's being wrong, so answer B (author not in the wrong). Wait, if the author is in the wrong, they're the one being unreasonable. If the boyfriend is correctly claiming a cultural identity based on upbringing, then the author's anger is unwarranted. Therefore, answer A (author in the wrong). Hmm. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong; they have the right to feel that cultural identity should include blood. However, that's a personal belief. If the boyfriend isn't deceptive, then the author is just having a difference in opinion. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe they're overreacting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's claim is based on culture, not genetics, the author's anger might be considered AITA. But the answer depends on whether cultural identity can be claimed without blood ties. In many contexts, yes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry over something that's culturally acceptable. So answer A.\n"
