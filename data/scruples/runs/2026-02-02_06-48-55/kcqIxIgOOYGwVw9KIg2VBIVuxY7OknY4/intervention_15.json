He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was too. The author feels that faking the culture is appropriation, but the boyfriend says he was raised Italian.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be complex. Even if someone isn't of a certain ethnicity by blood, being raised in that culture can make them identify with it. The boyfriend's upbringing includes speaking Italian, living in an Italian community, and participating in cultural practices. That's a lot of factors contributing to his identity.\n\nThe author's issue seems to be more about authenticity and blood relation. But cultural identity isn't solely based on genetics. It's about how one is raised and the culture they associate with. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be a stereotype; he's sharing a genuine part of his upbringing. The author might be conflating cultural appropriation with cultural appreciation. Appropriation is usually when someone adopts elements of a culture without facing the associated challenges, but in this case, the boyfriend's connection seems rooted in his actual environment.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend isn't denying his non-Italian father's background but is embracing the culture he was immersed in. The author's frustration could stem from a belief that cultural identity must be purely genetic, which isn't the case. People can have mixed heritage or be adopted into cultures and still identify with them. The key here is respect and authenticity. If the boyfriend is honoring and living the culture, then it's a valid identity. The author's reaction might be more about personal values than the boyfriend's actions. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, but considering the nuances, perhaps the boyfriend's claim is valid, making the author in the wrong? Wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Hmm. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. So maybe the user thinks the boyfriend is justified, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. \n\nCultural identity is about self-identification. If the boyfriend feels Italian because of his upbringing, even without blood, it's his right. The author's anger might be about authenticity, but cultural identity isn't just about blood. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the boyfriend's claim is valid. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified in feeling that the boyfriend isn't truly Italian, then the answer could be B. But if the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid, then the author is in the wrong. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong) or A? Hmm. Let me check again. The author is angry because the boyfriend doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised in an Italian household. So he was too. The author thinks that just speaking the language and cooking Italian food doesn't make him Italian. The boyfriend says he was raised Italian. The author's issue is about blood relation. But in reality, cultural identity doesn't require blood relation. So the author is in the wrong for being angry at something that's a valid part of the boyfriend's identity. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the author is dismissing the boyfriend's cultural upbringing. Wait, but the user originally thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe I need to clarify. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is correct in their view, then the answer is B. If the author is wrong, then A. Since cultural identity isn't solely based on blood, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A.\n"
