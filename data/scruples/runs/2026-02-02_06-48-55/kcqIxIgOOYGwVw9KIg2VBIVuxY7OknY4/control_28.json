He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about whether it's acceptable for the boyfriend to identify as Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, and he himself was raised in that environment too. He even learned Italian at school.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend claims to be Italian, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have actual Italian ancestry. The boyfriend argues that being raised in an Italian household makes him Italian in culture, even if not by blood.\n\nHmm. Cultural identity can be complex. If someone is raised in a cultural environment, they might feel a strong connection to that culture. But does that make it okay to claim that ethnicity if there's no biological link? Some people might argue that cultural upbringing is enough, while others might say that ethnicity is tied to ancestry.\n\nThe author's issue is with the boyfriend claiming Italian identity without any blood relation. The boyfriend's explanation is that he was raised Italian. But the author feels that cooking Italian food or speaking the language doesn't equate to being Italian by ethnicity. \n\nIt's possible that the author is not wrong in feeling this way. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If someone is using aspects of a culture without a genuine connection, it can be seen as appropriative. However, if someone is raised in that culture, even without blood relation, they might feel they belong to it. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised by someone who was adopted into an Italian family, so the connection is a few steps removed. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage. If he's claiming to be ethnically Italian, then the author has a point because he doesn't have that ethnic background. However, if he's identifying culturally as Italian, that might be a different matter. The line between cultural identity and ethnic identity can be blurry. \n\nIn some cases, people who are adopted into a different culture can identify with that culture, especially if they were raised in it. But the boyfriend's case is that his mother was adopted, and he was raised in an Italian household. It's a secondhand connection. So maybe the author's frustration is valid because the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian, even if he was culturally raised in an Italian environment. \n\nAppropriation versus appreciation is another angle. If the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in the culture and respects it, is that different? The author might be upset because the boyfriend isn't just appreciating the culture but claiming it as his own ethnic identity. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid concern about cultural misrepresentation. The boyfriend's justification might not address the fact that ethnic identity is often tied to ancestry. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
