He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their boyfriend about claiming to be Italian. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She's bilingual and even lived in Italy. The boyfriend was raised in a similar way because his mom was, and his dad isn't Italian. The boyfriend cooks Italian food, speaks some Italian, and identifies as Italian. The author is upset because he's not of Italian descent and feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be tricky. Some people identify with a culture even without blood relations, especially if they were raised in that culture. Like, if someone is adopted into a different culture and grows up with its traditions, language, and community, they might feel a strong connection. So the boyfriend's claim could be about his upbringing and cultural environment.\n\nBut the author is bothered by him saying he's Italian when there's no blood relation. Is that valid? Cultural appropriation is usually about non-members adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's struggles. However, in this case, the boyfriend was raised around Italian culture, so it's more like cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. He's not taking elements to mock but actually integrating them into his life.\n\nThe author's issue seems to be about authenticity. They think you need blood relation to claim the culture. But many people identify with cultures they're connected to through upbringing, marriage, etc. For example, someone who converts to a religion isn't in the wrong for being part of that religion. Similarly, cultural identity isn't always about genetics.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. If he was immersed in the culture and community, it's possible he genuinely identifies that way. The author's anger might stem from a belief that cultural identity requires blood ties, which isn't universally accepted. Others might argue that culture is about lived experience and upbringing.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the boyfriend's identification is genuine and respectful, then the author might be overreacting. But if the author values blood relation as necessary for cultural identity, that's their perspective. However, the boyfriend isn't appropriating; he's living the culture he was raised in. The author's reaction could be seeing as a misunderstanding of what constitutes cultural identity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the validity of his cultural upbringing.\n"
