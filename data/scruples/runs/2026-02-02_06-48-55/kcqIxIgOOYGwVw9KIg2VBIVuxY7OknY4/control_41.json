He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have any Italian blood.\n\nHmm, so the question is about cultural identity. The boyfriend identifies as Italian based on his upbringing and cultural practices. But the author is upset that he's not ethnically Italian. I need to figure out if the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be complex. Sometimes people adopt the culture they grow up in, even if they don't have ancestral ties. The boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, so he was too. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. So he might feel a strong connection to Italian culture. But the author is focused on biological heritage. \n\nBut does cultural identity require biological ties? I think many people identify with a culture without being ethnically from that background. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with it. However, some people might see this as cultural appropriation, especially if it's superficial. But the boyfriend seems to have grown up in that culture, so maybe it's more legitimate.\n\nThe author's issue is that the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian without being ethnically so. But the boyfriend is raised in that culture. The author might feel that cultural identity is about blood, but others might argue it's about upbringing. This could be a clash in perspectives. The boyfriend isn't acting stereotypical, but the author is upset about the claim. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the boyfriend genuinely identifies as Italian and has a strong cultural connection, then maybe the author's anger is misplaced. But if the author feels that cultural identity should be based on ethnicity, then their frustration is understandable. However, it's a cultural debate. The boyfriend's claim isn't harmful if he's just sharing his upbringing. The author might need to communicate their feelings better, but whether they're in the wrong depends on how strict one is about cultural identity.\n\nIn some communities, cultural identity is about how you were raised, not blood. So the author might be misunderstanding the concept. The boyfriend isn't appropriating for attention; he's part of that culture through upbringing. So the author might be the one wrong here if they're invalidating his cultural identity. But if the boyfriend is using it to pretend to be from Italy without any connection, that's different. But according to the description, he has a legitimate cultural upbringing. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, but the boyfriend's identity is valid. Maybe the author is overreacting. I'm a bit confused. \n\nAnother angle: cultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation. If the boyfriend is living the culture, it's appreciation. But if he's using it to pretend to be Italian for validation, it's appropriation. The user says he's not acting stereotypical, so maybe it's appreciation. The author's issue is about blood, but the boyfriend's identity is based on upbringing. So the author is in the wrong for not accepting his cultural identity. So answer A or B? \n\nWait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identity is valid, then the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no. If the boyfriend is allowed to identify as Italian, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the author is wrong for invalidating his identity. This is tricky. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no. If the boyfriend's identity is valid, then the author is wrong to be angry. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have different values. It's a conflict of perspectives. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is acceptable, then the author is in the wrong for being upset. If the boyfriend's claim is inappropriate, then the author is right. \n\nThe boyfriend has a strong cultural upbringing, so his identity is legitimate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So the answer would be A. But wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend is allowed to identify as Italian, then the author is in the wrong. So answer A. But maybe the answer is B, because the author isn't wrong to have their feelings. It's a personal issue. \n\nThis is complicated. I think the key point is that cultural identity isn't strictly about biology. The boyfriend's identity is valid based on upbringing. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting that. So the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the author values ethnicity over culture, they have a right to feel that way. But in terms of the broader context, cultural identity can be based on upbringing. So the author is in the wrong for being angry. Answer A.\n"
