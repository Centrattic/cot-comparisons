He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original question) is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically Italian. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was also raised in that environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, etc., but he doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels that because he's not ethnically Italian, he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian.\n\nSo, the key points here are cultural identity vs. ethnic heritage. The boyfriend is identifying with the culture he was raised in, which is different from his ethnicity. The author is upset because they believe that being Italian should be tied to ethnic background, not just cultural upbringing.\n\nI need to think about how cultural identity is formed. If someone is raised in a household with strong cultural practices, they might identify with that culture even if they don't have the ethnic background. For example, someone raised in a Mexican household in the US might identify as Mexican-American even if their parents are from different ethnic backgrounds. Cultural identity is often about how one is raised and the practices they participate in.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that ethnicity is important. They might feel that claiming an ethnic identity without that background is appropriative. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic, but it's different from cultural appreciation. If the boyfriend is immersed in the culture and respects it, some might argue it's not appropriation. However, others might say that without the ethnic ties, it's still appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which could mean that he identifies culturally rather than ethnically. The author might be conflating ethnic identity with cultural identity here. In many cases, people can identify with a culture they were raised in regardless of their ethnic background. For example, someone can be a second-generation immigrant and identify strongly with their parents' culture even if they don't have the same ethnic background as their ancestors.\n\nBut the author's point is about authenticity. They might feel that the boyfriend is being deceptive by claiming an ethnic identity that he doesn't have. The boyfriend isn't acting stereotypical, so maybe he's not trying to be someone he's not, but the author is still upset about the claim.\n\nIn terms of fairness, does the author have a right to be upset? If the boyfriend is open about his background (like the mother's adoption and the cultural upbringing), then others might see it as a legitimate cultural identity. However, if he's being deceptive or hiding the fact that he's not ethnically Italian, that could be an issue. The original question mentions that the boyfriend's mother's background is known, so perhaps the boyfriend isn't hiding it. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from personal values about cultural authenticity. But culturally, identity is often self-defined. So, if the boyfriend feels Italian because of how he was raised, some people would agree he can identify as such. However, others might argue that cultural identity should be tied to ethnic heritage, especially in cases where it's not the dominant culture in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the boyfriend is transparent about his background and the cultural upbringing is genuine, then the author's anger might be about something that's more about personal values than the boyfriend's actions. On the other hand, if the boyfriend is pretending to have an ethnic heritage to gain social acceptance, that's different. But according to the given info, the boyfriend's mother's history is known, so he's not hiding it. Therefore, the author might be in the right to have feelings about it, but the boyfriend's identification as Italian could be valid. However, the author's judgment here could be seen as inconsiderate of how cultural identity is formed. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the situation is a matter of differing views on cultural identity. Wait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe I need to reconsider. If the boyfriend is raised in the culture and identifies with it, even without ethnic ties, then the author's anger is about a non-issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset. But if the author feels that cultural appropriation is happening, even if it's not malicious, then it's a matter of personal boundaries. So, the answer might be A or B. It's a bit tricky. Let me check again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If cultural identity can be self-defined based on upbringing, then the author is wrong to be angry. If the author's stance is that cultural identity must be tied to ethnicity, then they have a valid personal opinion. However, in most discussions, cultural identity is more about how one is raised. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) if cultural identity is based on upbringing. Wait, no. If the boyfriend is identified as Italian by his upbringing, then the author is wrong to be upset. Therefore, the answer would be B. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user's initial thought was that the author is in the wrong, so the answer should be A or B based on that. Let me make sure. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger is unwarranted because the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid, then the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger is justified because the boyfriend is appropriating a culture without ethnic ties, then the author is not in the wrong. Since cultural identity can be self-identified, the author might be in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
