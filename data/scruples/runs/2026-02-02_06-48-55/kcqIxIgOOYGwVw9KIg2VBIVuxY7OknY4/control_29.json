He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was brought up with Italian culture, even going to Italian school. The author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have any Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. In many cases, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. If someone is raised in a culture, speaks the language, and practices the traditions, they might identify with that culture. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still consider themselves part of that culture if they were raised that way.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, even if not by blood. The author's issue is that he's claiming to be Italian without any actual heritage. But in some contexts, cultural identity is about lived experience and upbringing, not just genetics. It's possible he has a legitimate connection through his upbringing, even if his family isn't biologically Italian.\n\nHowever, the author's concern isn't about stereotyping or caricatures but about the authenticity of the claim. She feels it's appropriation because he's not \"blood Italian.\" But cultural appropriation is different from cultural appreciation. If he's celebrating the culture respectfully, as he does with cooking and language, it might not be appropriation. Still, some people might feel uncomfortable if they believe cultural identity should be tied to ancestry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. If the boyfriend genuinely identifies with Italian culture because of his upbringing, then his claim isn't necessarily invalid. Cultural identity can be complex, and it's not always binary. The author's reaction might stem from a belief that heritage is only through blood, which others might not agree with. However, it's also valid for her to feel that the lack of biological connection makes the claim inauthentic, especially if it's important to her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on differing views of cultural identity. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
