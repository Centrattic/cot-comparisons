He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he was raised in an Italian household, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture because he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity and how it's perceived. Cultural heritage can be passed down through upbringing, language, traditions, etc., even if there's no direct blood relation. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian home, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and was educated in the culture. So he might identify with Italian culture through his upbringing.\n\nHowever, the author is upset because he claims to be Italian without having Italian blood. This touches on the idea of cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation. The boyfriend might be practicing cultural appreciation since he's immersed in the culture from a young age. But the author sees it as appropriation because there's no blood relation.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of ethnicity in cultural identity. Some people might argue that cultural identity is about shared heritage and experience, not just genetics. Others might say that claiming an ethnicity without biological ties is problematic, especially if it's used to gain social capital or belonging.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, which makes sense if his mother's family was very involved in the culture. The author's issue is with him claiming Italian identity when he's not ethnically Italian. It's a nuanced situation. The key factors here are how the boyfriend's identity is formed and how the author perceives that identity.\n\nI should also consider if the boyfriend is being insincere. The author says he \"beats around the bush\" and doesn't directly address the concern. This could indicate that he's aware of the issue but isn't fully acknowledging it. However, if the boyfriend genuinely identifies with Italian culture because of his upbringing, the author's anger might be about something that's not entirely within his control\u2014his cultural identification is based on his environment and education.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal values. The author might value ethnic authenticity highly, while the boyfriend values cultural identity through upbringing. This is a difference in perspective rather than a clear right or wrong. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether cultural identification is valid without blood ties. If the boyfriend's identity is legitimate through upbringing, then the author's anger might be unfounded. If the author believes that being Italian requires blood ties, then the boyfriend's claim is invalid, and the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing or must be inherited biologically. Different people have different views on this. If the society or the culture in question recognizes cultural upbringing as valid for identity claims, then the boyfriend's stance is justified, and the author is in the wrong. If not, then the author has a valid point. Given that many cultures recognize acculturation and adoption into a culture as valid forms of identity, the boyfriend's position might be acceptable, making the author in the wrong. However, this can be subjective. So, after weighing these factors, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
