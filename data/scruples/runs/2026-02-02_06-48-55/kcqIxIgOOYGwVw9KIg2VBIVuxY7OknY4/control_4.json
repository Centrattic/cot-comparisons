He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and the family even had a statue of the Pope. The boyfriend grew up in this environment, learned Italian in school, and now claims to be Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have actual Italian blood but still identifies as Italian. The boyfriend responds by saying he was raised Italian, even though it's not by blood.\n\nSo, the main issue here is cultural identity versus racial/ethnic background. The boyfriend is part of the Italian culture through upbringing but not by ancestry. The author feels that without the blood, he isn't truly Italian. \n\nI should consider cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation. If someone is raised in a culture, even if not by blood, does that make them part of that culture? Some people argue that culture is more than just blood\u2014it's about identity, upbringing, and community. Others might say that claiming a heritage without the ancestral roots could be problematic, especially if it's done to gain certain privileges or connections.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, being part of an Italian community\u2014might be seen as a genuine connection to the culture. However, the author's frustration is about the authenticity of his claim. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If he's respectful and immersed in the culture, maybe it's appreciation. But if he's using it to falsely claim identity, that's appropriation.\n\nAnother angle: In many cultures, especially in places like Italy, national identity can be tied to both ethnicity and citizenship. But here, the question is about cultural identity. If the boyfriend identifies with Italian culture due to upbringing, is that valid? Some people might say yes, especially if he's been immersed in it since childhood. However, others might see it as inauthentic if there's no genetic link.\n\nThe author's perspective is that bloodline matters. This is a common viewpoint in discussions about ethnicity. However, in many cases, especially with adoption and intermarriage, identity can be complex. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so perhaps the boyfriend's connection is through her upbringing, even if not through DNA.\n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian might be his way of explaining his cultural background. But the author feels it's a form of appropriation. It's possible that the author values ethnic heritage more strictly, while the boyfriend sees cultural upbringing as sufficient.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural sensitivity issues here. If the boyfriend is part of an Italian community and participates in the culture authentically, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's using it to gain a sense of belonging or to claim a heritage he doesn't have, that could be an issue. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is being dishonest or inauthentic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Some might side with the author, thinking that claiming a culture without the blood is appropriative. Others might think that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. The key is whether the boyfriend is respectful and genuine in his connection to the culture. If he's been raised in that environment and identifies with it, maybe it's not wrong. But the author's feelings are valid if they feel the boyfriend is being inauthentic.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural perspectives. If the boyfriend is part of the Italian community and respects the culture, then B (not in the wrong). If he's using it superficially without deeper connection, then A (in the wrong). However, the scenario seems to suggest that the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in the culture, which might lean towards B. But the author's perspective is that blood matters, so maybe A. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer isn't clear-cut, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are valid in valuing ethnic heritage. Alternatively, if cultural identity is considered sufficient, then the author is wrong. It's a bit of a grey area.\n"
