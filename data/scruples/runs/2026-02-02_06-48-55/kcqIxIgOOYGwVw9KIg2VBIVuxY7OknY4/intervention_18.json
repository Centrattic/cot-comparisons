He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in a similar environment, learned Italian, cooked Italian food, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian but isn't of Italian descent. The author is upset because he's appropriating the culture, even though he wasn't born into it.\n\nHmm, cultural identity can be tricky. Some people might argue that if you're raised in a culture, you can identify with it, especially if you were immersed in it from a young age. The boyfriend's case seems to be that he was culturally Italian, even if not by blood. On the other hand, the author feels that without actual heritage, it's not appropriate to claim the culture. \n\nBut where's the line drawn here? Some cultures do embrace people who were raised in that environment, even if not by birth. For example, someone raised in Japan might identify as Japanese even if their parents are from elsewhere. However, others might see it as cultural appropriation, especially if they're not respecting the nuances or if they're using it for personal gain. \n\nIn this case, the boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way, just being proud of the way he was raised. The author's issue seems to be about authenticity through blood. But cultural identity isn't always about genetics. If someone is deeply involved in a culture, speaks the language, and was raised in it, they might feel a legitimate connection. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian in a harmful way; he's just expressing his upbringing. The author's perspective is valid, but maybe they're being too strict. It's possible that the boyfriend's identification with Italian culture is genuine based on his experiences. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong for being angry about something that's a matter of cultural identity rather than blood. But I should check if there's any cultural appropriation involved. The boyfriend isn't misusing the culture for profit or in a stereotypical manner; he's just part of the community and environment. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user asked if the author is in the wrong. If the author is upset over cultural identity versus heritage, it's a nuanced issue. Some might side with the author, others with the boyfriend. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to feel that cultural identity should be based on heritage. Wait, but others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted. Hmm. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Given that the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household and environment, maybe it's okay for him to identify as Italian, making the author wrong for being upset. So answer A? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to weigh again. If someone is raised in a culture, they can identify with it. But if the author values blood ties, that's a personal choice. The boyfriend isn't harming anyone. The author is in the wrong for being upset over something that's a matter of personal identity. So answer A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but maybe not. If the author is upset because the boyfriend is faking it, but he's not faking it; he was raised in that culture. The line between cultural identity and appropriation is important here. If the boyfriend is immersed in the culture and respects it, it's not appropriation. Therefore, the author is wrong for being angry. So answer A.\n"
