He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. The author feels that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian without the blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Sometimes people identify with the culture they were raised in, especially if it's a significant part of their upbringing. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. Even though he doesn't have the blood, he might see his identity as tied to that culture.\n\nBut the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. There's a debate here about whether cultural identity requires ancestry. Some might argue that cultural identity can be formed through upbringing and environment, not just genetics. Others might say that claiming a culture without heritage is appropriation, especially if it's to the point of presenting oneself as part of that culture.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian, which could be a valid point. However, the author feels it's inauthentic because he can't claim the heritage. The key issue is whether the boyfriend's identification is respectful or if it's a form of appropriation. If he's genuinely immersed in the culture and respects it, it might be seen as a valid cultural identity. But if he's using it to pretend to have a heritage he doesn't, that's different.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction is about feeling that the boyfriend is being inauthentic. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking, etc.) are positive engagements with the culture. The problem is the claim of being Italian. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. \n\nIn some cases, people from adopted backgrounds might struggle with their identity. The boyfriend's mother was adopted, so maybe he's trying to connect to a part of his heritage through her. But he's still not ethnically Italian. The author's frustration might stem from the idea that cultural identity shouldn't be claimed without the necessary biological ties, which is a common viewpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural identity is often about how people live and identify, not just genetics. If the boyfriend is raised in that culture and identifies with it, it's more about personal identity than blood. However, some people might feel that claiming a culture without any heritage is misleading, especially if it's important to the author.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian culture through upbringing, then the author's anger might be misplaced. But if the boyfriend is pretending to have heritage he doesn't, that could be problematic. The key is whether the boyfriend is being honest about his background. The boyfriend says he's not by blood but raised Italian, which the author finds insufficient. The author might be right to feel upset if the boyfriend is not transparent about his actual heritage when making claims about being Italian.\n\nBut the boyfriend's defense is that he was raised in that culture. So maybe the author is overreacting because cultural identity can be fluid. However, the author's feelings are valid if they feel the boyfriend is being inauthentic. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the boyfriend presents himself. If he's clear about his background when asked, maybe the author is being too strict. But if he's presenting himself as ethnically Italian when he isn't, that's different.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author's feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's identification with the culture through upbringing is also a legitimate aspect of identity. However, if the boyfriend is not transparent about his actual heritage when making claims about being Italian, then the author has a point. Since the boyfriend does mention being raised Italian, but the author still feels it's appropriation, it's possible the author is in the right to be upset if the boyfriend is not being honest about his background.\n"
