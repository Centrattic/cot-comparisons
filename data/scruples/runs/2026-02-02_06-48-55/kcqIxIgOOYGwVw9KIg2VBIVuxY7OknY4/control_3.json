He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was also raised in a similar environment, learned Italian, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian culturally but not ethnically. The author is upset because he's claiming an identity without biological ties.\n\nI need to consider cultural identity here. Many people identify with a culture based on upbringing rather than ancestry. For example, adopted individuals or those raised in multicultural homes might identify with a culture they're immersed in. The boyfriend's case seems similar\u2014he's been raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, and participates in cultural practices. So, culturally, he's Italian.\n\nThe author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But ethnicity isn't the only factor in cultural identity. People can adopt and honor a culture even if they're not ethnically part of it, especially when raised in that environment. The boyfriend isn't appropriating in a harmful or superficial way; he's immersed in it from a young age.\n\nHowever, the author feels it's appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If someone is taking elements of a culture without respecting or understanding it, that's problematic. But in this case, the boyfriend is part of the culture through his upbringing. So, it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation.\n\nStill, the author's feelings are valid. They might feel that without biological ties, he shouldn't claim the identity. But cultural identity is multifaceted. The boyfriend's identification as Italian is legitimate based on his upbringing. The author's anger might stem from a different perspective on what constitutes cultural belonging.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is based on cultural upbringing, which is a valid form of identity. The author has the right to feel that their boyfriend's claim is inauthentic from their perspective, but the boyfriend's identification isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
