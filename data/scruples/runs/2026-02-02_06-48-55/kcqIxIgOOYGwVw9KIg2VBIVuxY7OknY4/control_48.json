He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was raised as Italian through adoption, and he grew up in an Italian household. The author feels that identifying as Italian without actual blood is appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in even without blood ties. For example, adoptees often take on the culture of their adoptive families. So the boyfriend's claim might be based on his upbringing and cultural environment.\n\nThe author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. But in many cases, cultural identity isn't strictly about genetics. People can grow up immersed in a culture, speak the language, and participate in traditions, which can be a valid basis for identification. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking Italian, etc.) show he's integrated into that culture, even if biologically unrelated.\n\nHowever, the author feels it's appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It usually refers to adopting elements of a culture in a disrespectful or stereotypical way. The boyfriend isn't acting stereotypical, according to the post. He's just identifying with the culture he was raised in. So maybe it's not appropriation but rather cultural affiliation through upbringing.\n\nThe key issue here is the definition of being Italian. If the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, with Italian language and traditions, many Italians might consider that sufficient. Blood can be a factor, but it's not the only one. The author's perspective is about ancestry, but others might prioritize cultural upbringing.\n\nThe boyfriend's response (\"raised Italian\") supports the idea that he's identifying with the culture he experienced. The author's frustration is valid if they value genetic heritage, but it's a matter of differing values. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be something he's not in terms of his cultural environment, just his ancestry.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's identification isn't wrong either. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing, and the author's perspective is a matter of opinion, not a clear ethical wrong.\n"
