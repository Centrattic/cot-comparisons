He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he grew up in an Italian household, learned the language, and so on. But the author feels he's appropriating the culture without being blood-related.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about cultural identity and appropriation. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and is part of the community. He doesn't act in a stereotypical way, but he identifies as Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nI need to consider cultural practices versus biological heritage. Some cultures value ancestry a lot, while others value upbringing and integration. For example, in many cases, people raised in a culture can adopt its traditions and identity, even if they don't have the bloodline. But the author might feel that ethnicity is about heritage, not just upbringing.\n\nBut is it appropriation? Cultural appropriation is when someone adopts elements of another culture without understanding or respecting it, often in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's significance. However, in this case, the boyfriend was immersed in the culture from a young age, so it's more about cultural integration than appropriation. He's not just taking bits here and there for fashion or trends; he's part of the community and practices the culture as part of his upbringing.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian, even if not by blood. The author's issue is with him claiming the ethnicity without the bloodline. This touches on the debate about what defines ethnicity: biology or cultural upbringing. In some contexts, ethnicity is self-identified. If he was raised in that culture and identifies with it, that might be acceptable. However, if the author feels it's misleading, especially if there's a sense of authenticity required for certain claims (like in legal or official contexts), that could be a point of contention.\n\nBut the situation here is personal. The author is upset about how he presents himself in social settings. The boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way, which might reduce the issue to a matter of personal values. The author might value biological ethnicity more, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing. Neither is inherently wrong, but it's a difference in perspective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, if the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, then the author's anger might be based on a strict biological view of ethnicity. However, cultural identity is complex. The boyfriend's claim isn't entirely false since he was raised in that culture. The author's feeling of being wronged might be valid if she feels he's being deceptive, but if he's transparent about his background (like his mother's adoption and his upbringing), then it's a matter of cultural identity. \n\nBut the problem is that he's quick to say he's Italian when discussing his upbringing. If the author feels this is misleading, especially if he's using it to align with a culture he doesn't biologically belong to, that could be seen as appropriation. However, since he was raised in that environment, it's more about cultural identity than appropriation. The line here is blurry. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer could swing either way, but generally, cultural identity isn't solely defined by biology. Since the boyfriend was immersed in the culture and practices it, he might have a legitimate claim to identifying as Italian. Therefore, the author might be in the right to have her feelings, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong in claiming the culture. However, the author's perspective is valid based on her values. But according to the question, we need to decide if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identification is legitimate, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend isn't wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger is based on cultural authenticity versus biological ethnicity, it's a matter of perspective. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's justified in her feelings, but the boyfriend's actions aren't necessarily wrong either. But maybe the answer is A if the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. Hmm. I need to choose between A and B. Considering that the boyfriend's cultural upbringing makes his identification as Italian valid, the author is not in the wrong for feeling this way. So the answer is B.\n"
