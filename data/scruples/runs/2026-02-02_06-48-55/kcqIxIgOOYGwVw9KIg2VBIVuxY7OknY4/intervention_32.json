He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend claims to be Italian, but the author is upset because he doesn't have any Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he was raised in an Italian culture, speaks the language, and cooks Italian food. The author feels like he's appropriating the culture because he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the difference between ethnicity and cultural identity. Ethnicity is about ancestry, but cultural identity can be based on upbringing, language, traditions, etc. So even if the boyfriend doesn't have Italian blood, if he was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, and celebrates the culture, is that enough to claim being Italian? That's a gray area. Some people might say that cultural identity isn't just about blood but about how you live and identify. \n\nThen there's the issue of appropriation vs. appreciation. The author is upset about appropriation, which is when someone from a dominant culture takes elements of a marginalized culture without permission or understanding, often in a way that's disrespectful. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in that culture. Is it appropriation if he's been immersed in it since birth? That might be more of a cultural appreciation or even a legitimate cultural identity, even without blood ties. \n\nThe author's main argument is that just because you can cook Italian and speak it doesn't make you Italian. But if someone grows up in that environment, they might genuinely feel part of that culture. The boyfriend's response is that he's \"raised Italian,\" which is a common way people identify. For example, people who are adopted or raised in a different culture often identify with that culture. So maybe the author is being too rigid in equating ethnicity solely with blood.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is claiming Italian identity when he has no ancestral ties, is that misleading? The author might feel their cultural identity is being diluted or misrepresented. But again, cultural identity isn't just about blood. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being inauthentic or deceptive. Since he was raised in an Italian environment and has adopted the culture, it's not entirely fake. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from personal values about what defines cultural identity. But there's no universal rule that you need blood to claim a culture. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering that cultural identity can be complex and not strictly based on ancestry. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is using it to gain some social advantage or if it's causing harm, then maybe the author's upset is justified. But based on the information given, it seems like it's a matter of personal belief versus cultural identity. \n\nSo, I think the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid perspective, but some might argue the opposite. However, considering that cultural identity isn't solely about blood, the author's stance might be seen as too narrow. But without more context on the boyfriend's intent or actions, it's hard to say. The question is whether being raised in a culture allows someone to claim that identity. In many cases, people are allowed to identify with a culture they were raised in, even without ancestry. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset about this.\n"
