He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in that environment. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. The author feels that he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Just because someone doesn't have blood ties doesn't mean they can't identify with a culture, especially if they were raised in that cultural environment. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture through his upbringing, so his identification might be genuine. \n\nBut the author's issue is about appropriation. Cultural appropriation is when someone adopts elements of another culture in a way that's seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's significance. However, in this case, the boyfriend seems to have grown up with Italian traditions, language, and practices, which is more like cultural assimilation rather than appropriation. \n\nThe question is whether claiming to be Italian is acceptable in this context. Since his mother was raised Italian and the family environment was Italian, it's possible that he genuinely identifies that way. However, the author might feel that without actual heritage, it's misleading. But cultural identity can be complex. People can have strong cultural ties without being of that ethnicity. \n\nThe key point is intent. If the boyfriend is not mocking the culture but genuinely part of it through upbringing, then the author's anger might be about something else\u2014maybe she values blood ties more than cultural upbringing. It's a matter of perspective. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's claim might be valid given his upbringing. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong."
