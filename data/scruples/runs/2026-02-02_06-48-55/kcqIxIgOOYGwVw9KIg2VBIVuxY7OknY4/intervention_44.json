He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend who claims to be Italian without being ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment but has no actual Italian blood.\n\nHmm, cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend was raised with Italian customs, speaks the language, cooks the food, and is part of the community. The author feels that just because he was raised that way doesn't make him ethnically Italian. But does cultural upbringing equate to cultural identity?\n\nThe key points here are about appropriation versus cultural identification. The boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way, but he is claiming the culture. The author is upset because he doesn't have the ethnic background. But if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, especially through family and community, does that give them the right to identify with that culture?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's mother's adoption into an Italian family complicates things. If she was raised as Italian and passed that on, maybe the boyfriend's connection is more than superficial. However, the author's argument is about blood relation. But cultural identity isn't always about blood. It's about shared experiences, language, traditions.\n\nThe boyfriend might be embracing the culture he grew up in, which is valid. The author is angry because he's \"faking\" it, but if the culture is part of his upbringing, is that appropriation or genuine cultural identification? There's a difference between appreciating a culture and appropriating it. Since the boyfriend's family was deeply involved in Italian culture, it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nSo, the author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of how cultural identity works. The boyfriend isn't appropriating; he's identifying with the culture that shaped his upbringing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that cultural identity can be formed through environment and upbringing, not just ethnicity.\n"
