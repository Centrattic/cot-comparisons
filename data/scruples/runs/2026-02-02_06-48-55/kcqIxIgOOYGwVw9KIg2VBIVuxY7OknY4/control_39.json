He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend who claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, and he grew up in a predominantly Italian area with Italian language education. The author is upset that he identifies as Italian without actual heritage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have direct ancestry. For example, someone raised in a Korean household might identify as Korean even if their parents are from a different country. So, the boyfriend might consider himself Italian because of his upbringing and environment, which is a valid perspective for some.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that cultural appropriation is happening because there's no blood relation. But cultural appropriation is usually about adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's significance. In this case, the boyfriend is part of the Italian community through his mother's upbringing, so it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. However, the author might feel that he's misrepresenting his heritage, which is a personal disagreement.\n\nThe boyfriend uses phrases like \"raised Italian,\" which suggests he's emphasizing cultural upbringing over blood. This is a common way people express cultural identity. The author's frustration comes from the fact that they want his identity to be based on ancestry. But cultural identity can be complex and multifaceted. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Maybe not. People can have different views on what constitutes belonging to a culture. However, the boyfriend's actions aren't necessarily wrong either. It might be more about differing perspectives rather than a clear right or wrong. The author's anger is valid based on their beliefs, but others might see the boyfriend's claim as legitimate due to his cultural experiences. So, the answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation involves subjective viewpoints, and the author's feelings are understandable even if others might see it differently.\n"
