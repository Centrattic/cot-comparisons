He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, and he was raised in an Italian household. The author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Can someone be part of a culture without ethnic ties? Like, if someone is raised in a certain culture, even if their parents aren't ethnically from that culture, does that count? The boyfriend was raised Italian, speaks the language, cooks the food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. So maybe he identifies with the culture he was raised in, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without blood. But cultural identity isn't just about blood. If you're raised in a culture, you can adopt its traditions and identity. So the boyfriend's claim might be legitimate from his perspective.\n\nIs the author being overly critical? Maybe. It's possible the author is not wrong in feeling that there's a lack of ethnic connection, but the boyfriend's identity is more about upbringing. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. Since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, it's more likely appreciation. So the author's anger might be misplaced.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend doesn't act in a stereotypical way. He's just identifying with the culture he was raised in. The author might be projecting their own views on what makes someone part of a culture. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but maybe the boyfriend isn't wrong either. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is valid, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. If not, then the author isn't.\n\nBut the key point is that cultural identity can be based on upbringing, not just ethnicity. So the author might be wrong to be upset. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong) or B? Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is correctly identifying as Italian culturally, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says the boyfriend is \"faking it\" because there's no blood. But cultural identity isn't about blood. So the boyfriend's identity is valid, making the author's anger unwarranted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
