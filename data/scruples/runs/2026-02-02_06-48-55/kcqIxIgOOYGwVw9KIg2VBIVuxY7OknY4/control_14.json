He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he isn't ethnically. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself grew up in that environment, speaking Italian, cooking Italian food, and living in an Italian neighborhood with mandatory Italian classes. He identifies as Italian but has no actual Italian blood.\n\nThe author feels he's appropriating the culture without being part of it. She's upset because he claims to be Italian, even though he's not ethnically. He responds that he was raised Italian, not by blood. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nHmm. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that cultural upbringing and identity aren't solely about blood. If someone is raised in a culture, they might feel connected to it. On the other hand, the author might see it as inauthentic if there's no ethnic background. \n\nThere's also the aspect of appropriation vs. appreciation. If he's genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, maybe it's appreciation. But if he's using it without any ties, some might see it as appropriation. The line between the two can be blurry. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. That could be valid in terms of cultural identity. However, the author's discomfort comes from the lack of ethnic heritage. It's about how one defines being Italian. If being Italian is about heritage, then he's not. But if it's about cultural identity and upbringing, then he might be considered Italian.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's actions might not be malicious, but if the author feels it's inauthentic, her feelings are valid. However, others might say cultural identity isn't just blood. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for having that feeling. \n\nBut then again, maybe the boyfriend has a legitimate claim to the culture through upbringing. It's a gray area. The answer might depend on societal views on cultural identity. In many cases, people can identify with a culture even without ethnic ties if they were raised in it. So the author might be overreacting. \n\nWait, but the author isn't saying he's being offensive or stereotypical. She's just upset that he's claiming a heritage he doesn't have. If he's not using it in a harmful way, maybe she's being too strict. \n\nI think the debate here is about what makes someone part of a culture. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing her feelings about cultural authenticity, which is a personal perspective. However, others might argue that cultural identity is more than blood, so she's in the wrong. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and since personal feelings about cultural authenticity can be valid, the answer might be B. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. But there's a counterargument that cultural identity isn't just about blood. \n\nI'm a bit torn, but I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because her feelings about cultural authenticity are her own, even if others might see the boyfriend's identity as valid.\n"
