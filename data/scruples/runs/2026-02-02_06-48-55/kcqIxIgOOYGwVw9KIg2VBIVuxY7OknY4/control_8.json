He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without actual blood ties. Hmm. So the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The author is upset because he presents himself as Italian, even though he doesn't have any Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't solely based on biology, right? People can adopt a culture through upbringing, even if they're not ethnically part of that culture. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. That seems like he's embracing the culture, which many people do. So, is it appropriation or just cultural appreciation?\n\nAppropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture in a disrespectful way, especially when there's a power imbalance. But here, the boyfriend is part of the culture through his upbringing. He's not mocking or misrepresenting it in a harmful way. He's living the culture as he was raised. So maybe it's more of cultural assimilation or integration rather than appropriation.\n\nThe author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But cultural identity isn't just about genetics. Many people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have ancestral ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might identify with that culture. So, if the boyfriend was raised Italian, it's reasonable for him to identify as such.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that cultural identity should be based on blood. But that's a narrow view. Cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language, etc.) align with his cultural upbringing. He's not denying his actual heritage unless his father's background is significant. However, the user mentions not knowing much about the father, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend isn't pretending to be ethnically Italian, just culturally. So when he says he's Italian, it's accurate in terms of his cultural upbringing. The author might be conflating ethnicity with cultural identity here. If the boyfriend grew up in that environment, it's valid for him to identify with that culture.\n\nBut then again, some people might argue that claiming an ethnic identity without any ancestral ties is problematic. However, ethnicity isn't always about biology. For example, in some countries, people with mixed heritage might still identify with one culture over another based on upbringing. So the key is whether the boyfriend's claim is respectful and not harmful. Since he's not stereotyping but rather embracing his upbringing, it might be a legitimate identification.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if she feels that cultural identity should be tied to ancestry. But in reality, cultural identity can be multifaceted. The boyfriend's situation is a bit of a gray area, but he's not necessarily wrong for identifying with the culture that raised him. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being angry over something that's a legitimate expression of cultural identity.\n"
