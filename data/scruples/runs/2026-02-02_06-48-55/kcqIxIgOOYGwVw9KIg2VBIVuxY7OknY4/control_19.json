He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. She feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People can identify with a culture they were raised in even if they don't have direct blood ties. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. That seems like cultural upbringing, not just appropriation. Cultural appropriation usually involves adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or without understanding, but here he's immersed in it through his mother's upbringing.\n\nThen there's the aspect of how he presents himself. He says he's Italian because of his upbringing and environment. The author is upset because she doesn't think speaking the language or cooking Italian food makes him Italian. But cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people identify with a culture based on upbringing and environment. For example, adopted children often take on the culture of their adoptive parents.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. She might feel that he's being deceptive or that he's not being authentic. The key point is whether he's being honest about his heritage. If he's not claiming it for any malicious reason and it's part of his genuine upbringing, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's trying to pass as ethnically Italian when he's not, that's different. The user's frustration is about the authenticity of his identity.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's mother's story. Since his mother was raised Italian but through adoption, maybe the boyfriend's claim is an extension of her identity. So he's continuing the cultural practices his mother embraced. In that case, it's part of his family's cultural identity, even if not blood-related. \n\nThe author's issue is more about blood relation. But many cultures value cultural heritage over blood. For example, someone adopted into a Japanese family and raised Japanese would identify as Japanese culturally. So the boyfriend's assertion might be legitimate in that sense.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that ethnicity and nationality are different from cultural practices. If he's claiming Italian ethnicity, which is about ancestry, then it's a different matter. But if he's identifying with Italian culture, that's valid. The line here is blurry. The author's problem is with him claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. But the boyfriend's side is that he was raised Italian, so he identifies that way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's not wrong for feeling upset about this. People have different views on what makes someone part of a culture\u2014blood vs. upbringing. But culturally, identifying with a culture you were raised in is common. Therefore, the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong for identifying as Italian based on upbringing and environment. The author's perspective is valid, but the boyfriend's is also valid. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the situation is nuanced. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If both sides have valid points, but the author's anger is based on a different definition of cultural identity, then maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
