He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend identifies as Italian without having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he's been raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, etc. The author feels that claiming Italian heritage without blood is appropriating the culture. \n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Ethnicity and national identity aren't solely based on blood. Many people identify with a culture due to upbringing, even if no biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. So, the boyfriend might genuinely feel Italian because of how he was raised.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. They might feel that without blood, he's not \"truly\" Italian. But cultural identity can be about lived experience. If he's been immersed in Italian culture his whole life, maybe it's valid for him to identify that way. \n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation is a factor here. The boyfriend isn't caricaturing Italian culture; he's embracing it as part of his identity. He's using it in a respectful way, not mocking. The author's problem is more about the claim of heritage rather than the expression of culture. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's explanation that he was raised Italian makes sense. His upbringing shaped his identity. The author might be prioritizing biological descent over cultural upbringing. However, some people do value ancestry in their identity. The conflict here is between two perspectives on what constitutes cultural belonging. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's self-identification is also valid. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way, but maybe they need to understand that cultural identity isn't just about blood. Alternatively, the boyfriend could clarify his situation more to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is honest about his background and the author is still upset, perhaps the author's stance is more about personal values. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because their feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's identification is also valid. However, the answer could lean towards A if the author's anger is seen as invalidating a legitimate cultural identity. \n\nHmm. I think the key is that cultural identity can be based on upbringing and environment. The boyfriend's identification as Italian is legitimate given his upbringing, so the author might be in the wrong for being angry about it. But maybe the answer is B because the author's feelings are valid, but they aren't necessarily wrong. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is legitimate, then the author is in the wrong. But if the author's feelings are valid, maybe not. This is tricky. The answer likely is B because both sides have valid points, but the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, just the situation isn't a clear right or wrong.\n"
