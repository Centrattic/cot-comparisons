He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian but not having Italian blood, which is causing the author to feel angry about cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cultural aspect here. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household. His mother is bilingual and they have Italian traditions. The boyfriend speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood with Italian curriculum. The author feels he's faking being Italian because he doesn't have Italian blood, but he was raised in an Italian environment.\n\nSo, is it okay to identify with a culture you were raised in even without blood ties? Cultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that if you were immersed in the culture from a young age, it's part of your identity regardless of ethnicity. Others might think that claiming a heritage without biological ties is appropriation. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, so he identifies that way. The author is upset because he's not of Italian descent. The key here is the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation. If he's genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, it's more about cultural affiliation. However, if there's no connection beyond surface-level aspects (like cooking and language), it might be seen as appropriation.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he claims to be Italian without being of Italian blood. But in reality, cultural identity isn't solely based on genetics. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment made Italian culture a significant part of his life. The author might be conflating ethnicity with cultural identity. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014cooking, speaking the language, participating in cultural practices\u2014shows a deep integration into the culture. So, even without blood, he's part of the culture in a meaningful way. The author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of what cultural identity entails. \n\nIn some cases, people raised in multicultural environments identify with the culture they were immersed in, even if their ancestry is different. The boyfriend's mother's adoption into an Italian family and the upbringing in an Italian household contribute to his cultural background. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for judging based on bloodline rather than lived experience and cultural integration.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) or A? Wait, no. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is correct in feeling that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture, then the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But if the boyfriend's identification is legitimate due to upbringing, then the author is in the wrong (A). \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If the boyfriend has a genuine connection to the culture through upbringing, then he's not appropriating; he's part of the culture. The author's issue is with the lack of blood relation, but cultural identity isn't always about blood. Therefore, the author might be the one misunderstanding, so the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong because they feel it's appropriation. However, the boyfriend's deep integration into the culture might mean he's not appropriating. \n\nI think in this case, the author's perspective is valid because they're upset about the boyfriend claiming a heritage he doesn't have genetically. However, the boyfriend's experience is valid too. It's a conflict between genetic heritage and cultural upbringing. In many cases, cultural identity can include both. So, the author might not be wrong in their feelings, but the boyfriend's identification is also valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to feel that way, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If the author is not wrong, then answer B. If the author is wrong for not recognizing the cultural upbringing, then A. \n\nGiven the context, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that the boyfriend is appropriating, but the boyfriend's identification is also valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to feel that way, even if the boyfriend's claim is legitimate.\n"
