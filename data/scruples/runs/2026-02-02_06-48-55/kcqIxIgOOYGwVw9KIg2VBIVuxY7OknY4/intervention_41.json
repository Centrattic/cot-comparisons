He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author thinks that just because he was raised Italian doesn't make him ethnically Italian, so she's upset about the cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have biological ties. For example, if someone grows up in a household where the culture is practiced, they might feel a strong connection. In this case, the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised that way, so he was too. His upbringing included Italian language, food, and traditions. So he might genuinely feel Italian, even without the blood.\n\nThe author is upset because he claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically. But cultural identity isn't solely based on genetics. Many cultures emphasize cultural heritage passed down through upbringing. The boyfriend isn't necessarily appropriating; he's participating in the culture he was raised in. The line between cultural pride and appropriation can be blurry, but if he was raised in that culture, it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation.\n\nThe author's issue is with the claim of being Italian. The boyfriend might not be lying if he identifies as Italian due to his upbringing. However, some might argue that without ethnic ties, it's more accurate to say he's culturally connected rather than ethnically Italian. But the boyfriend's perspective is that he was raised Italian, which is a valid way to form cultural identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's upset about cultural appropriation, she might be misunderstanding cultural identity. Cultural identity can be shaped by upbringing, not just blood. The boyfriend isn't faking it if he was raised in that culture. Therefore, the author's anger might be misplaced. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, since cultural appropriation can be a valid concern, but the boyfriend's situation is more about cultural identity through upbringing. Wait, but cultural appropriation typically refers to adopting elements from a culture without being part of it, which can be different from someone who was raised in that culture. So maybe the boyfriend isn't appropriating because he was immersed in it from a young age. Therefore, the author's issue might be about authenticity in cultural claims, but if the boyfriend identifies as Italian due to upbringing, then the author is in the wrong for being upset. Or is it the other way around?\n\nHmm. I think the key point is whether cultural identity is determined by upbringing. If the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, practices the culture, and identifies as Italian, then his claim is valid. The author's argument that blood is necessary might not hold. So in that case, the author is in the wrong for being angry. Therefore, the answer would be A. But wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So if the author is right, the answer is B. Wait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But based on the analysis, if cultural identity isn't solely based on blood, then the author is in the wrong for being upset. So the answer would be A. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, that means the author is in the wrong. If B, not in the wrong. So based on the analysis, if the boyfriend's identity is valid despite no blood, then the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
