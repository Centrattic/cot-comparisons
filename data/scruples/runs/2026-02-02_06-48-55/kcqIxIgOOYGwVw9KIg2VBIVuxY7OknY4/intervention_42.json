He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He himself was raised in a similar environment, learned Italian, and even his school required it until grade 8. The boyfriend takes pride in Italian culture, cooks Italian food, and socializes with Italians. The author is upset because he doesn't have any Italian blood and feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nThe author argues that just because someone is raised in a certain culture or can speak the language doesn't make them part of that ethnic group. The boyfriend responds that he's \"raised Italian,\" not by blood. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about this.\n\nHmm, cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still claim that identity. But others might see it as appropriation if there's no direct heritage. \n\nThe boyfriend's case seems more about cultural upbringing rather than just adopting elements. He was immersed in the Italian culture from a young age, taught the language, and part of a community. So, his identification as Italian might be genuine from his perspective. However, the author feels it's inauthentic because of the lack of blood relation. \n\nIs the author wrong to feel this way? It depends on how one views cultural identity. If the boyfriend's identity is based on his upbringing and environment, then he may feel it's valid. The author's issue is with cultural appropriation, but if the boyfriend is integrating the culture into his life authentically, it's more about cultural appreciation. However, the line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. \n\nThe author isn't wrong to have feelings about it, but is it their place to dictate how others identify? The boyfriend's claim might be seen as legitimate if he was raised in that culture. So, the author might be in the right to express their discomfort, but maybe overreacting. Alternatively, the boyfriend might be misrepresenting his heritage, which could be problematic. \n\nI think the key point is whether claiming Italian identity is about heritage or upbringing. If the boyfriend's mother was culturally Italian but not ethnically, does that pass down to him? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger is about authenticity, but cultural identity can be multifaceted. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, it's possible that the boyfriend's identity is valid from his perspective. But the author's feelings are valid too. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because cultural appropriation is a real issue, and the boyfriend's claim without blood relation might be seen as inauthentic. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, if the culture is part of his upbringing, it's part of his identity. I'm conflicted but leaning towards B.\n"
