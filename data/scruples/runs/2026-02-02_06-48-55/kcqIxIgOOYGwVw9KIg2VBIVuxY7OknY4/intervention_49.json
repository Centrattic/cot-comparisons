He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend was raised in a similar environment by his mother, grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, and even had Italian as a mandatory school subject until grade 8. He cooks Italian food, speaks Italian to some extent, and takes pride in the culture. However, the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and she views his claim as appropriation.\n\nThe author's main issue is that even though he was culturally raised Italian, he doesn't have any actual Italian ancestry. She argues that just being raised in the culture doesn't make someone part of it. The boyfriend responds by saying he was raised Italian, but the author thinks that's not enough.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree. Let me consider both sides. Culturally, some people do identify with the culture they were raised in, even if they don't have ancestral ties. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he might have grown up with strong cultural ties. However, the author's point is about biological heritage versus cultural upbringing. \n\nIs it wrong for someone to identify with a culture they were immersed in, even without blood ties? In many cases, people adopt and identify with cultures different from their own, especially when they were raised in that environment. The boyfriend's case seems more about cultural upbringing rather than outright appropriation, since he's been part of the culture through his family and environment. \n\nBut the author feels that claiming Italian heritage without blood is a form of appropriation. However, \"appropriation\" usually refers to adopting elements of a culture without respecting or understanding them, often in a harmful way. In this case, the boyfriend is deeply embedded in the culture through his upbringing, so it's more about cultural identity. \n\nThe key here is whether cultural upbringing is sufficient for claiming cultural identity. If the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, and practices the traditions, many would argue that he can identify as Italian culturally, even without biological ties. The author might be conflating cultural identity with ethnic heritage. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is claiming Italian heritage for personal gain or to exclude others, that's different. But the post doesn't suggest that. He seems to have genuine cultural ties. The author's anger might stem from her own values about cultural heritage versus cultural upbringing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is sufficient for his identification. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) if the author is correct in her stance. But if cultural upbringing is valid, then the author is in the wrong (A). \n\nBut the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. Wait, no, the user says \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\" So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf the boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, etc., then his identification as Italian is valid culturally. Therefore, the author is in the right to be upset if she feels he's falsely claiming heritage, but if cultural upbringing is considered sufficient, then the author is wrong. \n\nBut in terms of cultural identity, people can identify with the culture they were raised in. So if the author is upset because he doesn't have blood ties, but he was raised Italian, then her stance is based on blood rather than culture. That might be her being in the right if she values blood heritage. However, the boyfriend's identification is based on his upbringing. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is sufficient, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the author's stance that blood is necessary is valid, then she's not in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's case seems to be a cultural one, so the author's anger might be unfounded. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, no, the options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) or B for no. If the author is in the right, then answer B. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Let me clarify: if the author is correct in being upset, then answer B (not in the wrong). If the author is wrong to be upset, then answer A (in the wrong). \n\nGiven that the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, even without blood, many would say he can identify as Italian. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So the answer is A. But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that ethnic identity is about heritage, not just culture. If the boyfriend doesn't have Italian ancestors, then technically he's not ethnically Italian. However, cultural identity is different. The author might be conflating the two. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the judgment often depends on societal norms. If the community sees cultural upbringing as sufficient, then the author is wrong. If blood is seen as necessary, then she's right. Since the boyfriend's case is about cultural upbringing, the author's anger might be misplaced. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
