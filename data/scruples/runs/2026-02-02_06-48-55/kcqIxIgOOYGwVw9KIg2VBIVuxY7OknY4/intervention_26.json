He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is upset because their boyfriend claims to be Italian, but he doesn't have any Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was raised in a similar environment, learned Italian, and even cooked Italian food. But the author feels that just because he was raised in that culture doesn't mean he's actually Italian. They think he's appropriating the culture.\n\nHmm. So, the author's main issue is with cultural identity. The boyfriend is claiming to be Italian without any blood relation. But the boyfriend's upbringing was heavily Italian\u2014bilingual, living in an Italian neighborhood, family traditions, etc. The author's argument is that you can't be Italian without blood, while the boyfriend argues that being raised in that culture makes him Italian.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, culture is more than just blood. People can adopt and live within a culture even if they're not ethnically part of it. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, which is a valid basis for identifying with it. On the other hand, some people might argue that ethnic heritage is a key part of cultural identity, especially for those who have that background. The author might feel that the boyfriend is taking credit for something he doesn't have a right to claim, which could be seen as appropriation or inauthentic.\n\nBut wait, cultural appropriation is usually about power dynamics and the dominant group adopting elements from a marginalized group, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The boyfriend isn't exploiting a minority culture; he was raised in it. So maybe the author is overreacting here, thinking it's appropriation when it's actually cultural inheritance through upbringing.\n\nAlso, identity is personal. The boyfriend identifies as Italian based on his upbringing, which is a legitimate way for some people to see themselves. The author's issue is more about lineage, but that's not the only way to define identity. The boyfriend's argument that he was \"raised Italian\" holds weight if he was deeply involved in the culture.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. They might feel that the boyfriend is being inauthentic or trying to claim something he isn't. But is that the boyfriend's fault? If he was genuinely raised in that culture, can he be blamed for identifying with it? The author might need to accept that cultural identity can be self-identified through upbringing and experience, not just blood.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is upset about the boyfriend's self-identification as Italian without blood, but the boyfriend was immersed in the culture. The author's perspective is about lineage, but the boyfriend's identity is based on experience. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting his self-identified cultural background. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, wait. Wait, the user asked if the author is in the wrong. If the author is correct in their viewpoint, then the answer would be A. But based on my analysis, the author might be overstepping by not recognizing the boyfriend's cultural upbringing. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong? Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nWait, the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). If the author's argument is that you can't be Italian without blood, but the boyfriend's upbringing is sufficient, then the author is in the wrong for not acknowledging that cultural identity can be adopted. So answer B. But if the author's feelings are valid, then maybe they aren't in the wrong for feeling that way, even if the boyfriend's identity is legitimate. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of right and wrong, it's a matter of perspective. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, maybe the author is wrong to be angry. But if the author's concern is about authenticity, then maybe the author isn't wrong to have that feeling. However, the boyfriend isn't harming anyone by identifying that way. So the author's anger might be unwarranted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A), because the boyfriend's self-identification as Italian is valid based on his upbringing and experience, even without blood. So the answer would be A.\n"
