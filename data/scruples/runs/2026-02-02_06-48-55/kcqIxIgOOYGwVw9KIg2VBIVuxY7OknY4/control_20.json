He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author is upset because he identifies as Italian culturally but isn't by blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. People can identify with a culture even if they don't have biological ties, right? Like, if someone was raised in a household that practices the culture, they might feel a connection. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and is part of an Italian community. So he might see himself as part of that culture.\n\nBut the author feels that he's appropriating the culture. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. But is it appropriation here? If he's been immersed in the culture from a young age, it's more like cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. Appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, often from a marginalized group. In this case, the boyfriend has a deep connection through his upbringing, so it's not really appropriation.\n\nThe author's issue is more about the biological aspect. She thinks that without Italian blood, he shouldn't claim the identity. But cultural identity isn't just about biology. Many people identify with their adopted culture or the culture they were raised in, especially if they were adopted or raised in a different cultural environment. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he grew up in that environment. His identity is valid because of his upbringing and experiences, not just genetics.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he was \"raised Italian\" makes sense in this context. If you're raised in a certain culture, you can identify with it even without blood ties. The author might be struggling with the idea that cultural identity can be based on experience rather than genetics. It's possible she's placing importance on ethnic heritage that the boyfriend doesn't share, leading to a conflict in values.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's not wrong to feel that he's being deceptive, but his identification as Italian is based on his upbringing. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian in a harmful way; he's part of the community and practices the culture. The author's anger might be more about her own values rather than the boyfriend's actions. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but the boyfriend's claim is based on his cultural upbringing, so it's a matter of differing perspectives rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
