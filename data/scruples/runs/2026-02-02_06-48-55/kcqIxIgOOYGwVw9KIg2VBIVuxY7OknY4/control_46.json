He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He himself was raised in a similar environment, grew up in an Italian neighborhood, and learned Italian in school. He cooks Italian food, knows the language, and takes pride in the culture. But the author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nThe key points here are about cultural identity and the validity of claiming a culture without biological ties. The boyfriend argues he was \"raised Italian,\" so he has a cultural connection even without blood. The author disagrees, thinking that just cooking and speaking the language doesn't make someone Italian.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, cultural identity isn't solely about blood; it can be about upbringing and environment. Many people adopt and pass on cultural practices without being biologically related. On the other hand, the author's sensitivity might be valid if she feels the boyfriend is being disingenuous or minimizing the cultural heritage by claiming it without ancestral ties.\n\nBut the boyfriend's case seems legitimate. His mother was deeply immersed in Italian culture, and he was raised in that environment. The fact that he was educated in Italian and has lived in that cultural context as a child might give him a genuine connection. However, if the author feels it's inauthentic, maybe she's not wrong to feel that way, but is that the boyfriend being in the wrong?\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The boyfriend isn't denying his biological roots but is emphasizing cultural upbringing. It's a gray area, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong for her feelings. However, the boyfriend's claim isn't entirely fabricated since he was raised in that culture. The answer might hinge on the definition of cultural identity. If the boyfriend is claiming heritage based on upbringing, it's a valid perspective. But if he's using it to pretend to have a biological connection, that's appropriation. The line here is thin. Since the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and he was raised accordingly, he might have a legitimate cultural identity. Therefore, the author's anger might be misplaced. Thus, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but I need to make sure I'm not conflating cultural identity with ethnicity. Alternatively, maybe the author is overreacting because cultural identity can be chosen. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing without biological ties, which the author finds inauthentic. The boyfriend's perspective is that culture isn't just blood, but the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
