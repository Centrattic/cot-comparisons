He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, and she was raised in that culture, so the boyfriend grew up with Italian traditions, language, and environment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author feels that cultural identity should be tied to blood relation, not just upbringing. But the boyfriend argues that being raised in an Italian household makes him Italian. The question is about appropriation versus cultural adoption.\n\nCultural appropriation is usually about taking elements of a culture without acknowledgment or respect, but here, the boyfriend is part of the culture through his upbringing. However, he doesn't have ancestral ties. The author is upset because he's claiming an identity he wasn't born into. \n\nBut cultural identity can be complex. Some people define themselves by nationality, others by culture. If someone is raised in a culture, they might feel that's their heritage even without blood ties. The boyfriend's case is unique because his mother's background is through adoption, but the family adopted the culture fully.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is inauthentic or being disingenuous. However, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture, speaks the language, and practices traditions. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation isn't clear here. Also, the boyfriend isn't trying to pass as ethnically Italian, just culturally. \n\nIn many cases, cultural identity isn't solely about biology. For example, someone born in Italy to non-Italian parents might still be considered Italian. Conversely, someone with Italian ancestry might not identify culturally. The boyfriend's situation is a mix of both\u2014no blood, but full cultural upbringing. \n\nThe author's perspective is valid in that they might feel the boyfriend isn't being honest about his heritage. But the boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing. The problem might be more about the author's expectations versus reality. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Maybe not. People have different views on what constitutes cultural identity. But is the author in the wrong for being angry? If the boyfriend isn't misrepresenting himself maliciously, just sharing his cultural upbringing, then the author's anger might be about a difference in values rather than a moral wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend is likely expressing his cultural identity as he perceives it, while the author has a different view on what makes someone Italian. Neither is necessarily wrong, but the author's reaction is based on their personal beliefs about cultural authenticity. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue is subjective and about differing perspectives on cultural identity.\n"
