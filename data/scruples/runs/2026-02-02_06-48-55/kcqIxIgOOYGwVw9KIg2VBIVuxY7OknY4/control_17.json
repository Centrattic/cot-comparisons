He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was also raised in an Italian environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian culturally, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset that he's claiming to be Italian without the ethnic background.\n\nNow, the key points here are cultural identity versus biological ethnicity. The boyfriend isn't claiming Italian heritage through ancestry but through cultural upbringing. This is a common issue in many cultures where people adopt the culture of their upbringing even if it's not their biological background. \n\nThe author's issue seems to be about authenticity. They feel that without blood ties, he's appropriating the culture. But cultural identity can be complex. For example, someone raised in a different culture might adopt aspects of it as part of their identity. The boyfriend isn't acting stereotypically Italian, which might reduce the perceived appropriation. However, the author is bothered by the claim of being Italian when there's no genetic link.\n\nI should also consider cultural sensitivity. In some contexts, people might see cultural appreciation as positive, especially if it's respectful. But in other cases, especially where there's a history of discrimination based on ethnicity, claiming a culture without the background could be seen as appropriation. However, if the culture was part of his upbringing, it's more about identity. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's mother was adopted into the Italian family, so he has a connection through her upbringing. If she was raised Italian and passed it down, does that count as cultural heritage? This could be seen as valid in some perspectives. \n\nThe author's frustration is about the claim of being Italian when there's no blood relation. But if the boyfriend is culturally Italian because of how he was raised, maybe the author is being too strict. On the flip side, if the author values ethnic heritage, they might have a valid point. \n\nIt's important to note that cultural identity is personal. The boyfriend might genuinely see himself as Italian due to his upbringing. The author's reaction might be about how he presents himself in social settings, especially when discussing his background with friends. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how one views cultural identity. If it's accepted that cultural upbringing can form part of one's identity, then the boyfriend isn't wrong. However, if the author's issue is with the lack of ethnic ties, then they might feel justified. But generally, cultural identity isn't solely based on blood, so the author might be in the wrong for being upset about this. However, it's a nuanced situation, and the answer might hinge on the specific dynamics between the couple.\n"
