He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. He was raised in that cultural environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and identifies as Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People can identify with a culture they were raised in even without blood relations. Like, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. For example, if a child is raised in Japan by Japanese parents, they might identify as Japanese even if their biological parents are from another country. So, the boyfriend's identification as Italian based on his upbringing and environment might be valid from a cultural standpoint.\n\nThe author is upset because he's not of Italian descent. But does blood relation necessarily determine cultural identity? That's a big question. Some people might argue that cultural identity is about how you're raised, the traditions you follow, and the community you belong to. Others might think that claiming a culture without biological ties is appropriation. But in this case, he was raised Italian, so it's more about cultural upbringing than appropriation, which usually involves taking elements of a culture without being part of it in any meaningful way.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so he was raised in that environment. The user is Italian, maybe? Or she's just upset about the cultural claim. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. But since he was immersed in the culture from a young age, speaking the language and participating in the traditions, it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nThe author's argument is that just because someone can cook Italian or speak the language doesn't make them Italian. But if you're raised in an Italian household, learning the language and traditions, isn't that a form of cultural identity? So the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that cultural upbringing can be as valid as blood relation in terms of identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel that the boyfriend is not being truthful about his heritage if he's making a claim based on blood. But if the boyfriend is clear that he's not of Italian descent but was raised that way, maybe the issue is more about the author's expectations versus his self-identification.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that cultural identity can be formed through upbringing and environment, even without blood ties. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) or A (Yes, she is in the wrong)? Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is right to be upset because cultural identity shouldn't be based on upbringing, then she's not in the wrong. But if the boyfriend's identification is valid, then she is in the wrong.\n\nI think the key point is that cultural identity is multifaceted. If the boyfriend's identity as Italian is based on his upbringing and experiences, then the author's anger might be misplaced. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the author is right, but if the boyfriend's identity is valid, then the author is in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. I need to recall that in many cases, people can identify with a culture they were raised in regardless of biology. Therefore, the author might be wrong to be angry. So the answer is B? Wait, the options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) and B for no. So if the author is wrong, the answer is A. Wait, the user asked \"Is the author in the wrong?\" If the author is correct in her anger, then the answer is B (No). If the author is in the wrong, then A. \n\nIn this case, if the boyfriend is culturally Italian due to upbringing, the author's anger is misplaced. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so answer A. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian. He was raised in an Italian household. So his cultural identity is valid. The author is upset because he's not of blood. But cultural identity isn't just about blood. So the author is wrong to be angry. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). So the answer should be A.\n"
