He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend claiming to be Italian, even though his mother was adopted by an Italian family and he was raised in an Italian household, but he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset because they feel he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. The boyfriend's mother was in foster care and adopted by an Italian family. She was raised with Italian culture, spoke the language, and even had that statue of the Pope. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and had Italian in school until grade 8. So he was immersed in the culture but not ethnically Italian.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that he's claiming Italian heritage without having any blood ties. They mention he doesn't act stereotypical, but still asserts his Italian identity. The author's stance is that just because someone was raised in a culture doesn't make them part of it. The boyfriend responds by saying he was raised Italian, but the author thinks that's not enough.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural appropriation versus appreciation. The boyfriend is part of the Italian community through his upbringing, not just taking aspects for show. He's cooking Italian food, speaking the language, and associating with Italians. If he was raised with those cultural practices, maybe it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation. But the author feels it's inauthentic because there's no blood relation.\n\nAnother angle: identity is often about upbringing and community, not just genetics. People can identify with a culture they were raised in, even without biological ties. The boyfriend might genuinely feel Italian because of how he was brought up, even if his mother was adopted. So, is the author wrong to be upset? Or is the boyfriend incorrect to claim that heritage?\n\nAlso, the term \"appropriation\" usually refers to adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or tokenistic. But here, the boyfriend is deeply involved in the culture. The author's problem is with the claim of being Italian. Maybe there's a difference between cultural heritage and one's own identity. The boyfriend might be identifying with the culture he's part of, which is different from someone from a dominant culture taking elements without connection.\n\nBut the author is uncomfortable with the lie, the boyfriend \"claiming to be Italian\" when he's not. The boyfriend's response is that he's not by blood but by upbringing. So is the author wrong for being upset? If the boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing and cultural background, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the boyfriend is being deceptive about his actual ethnicity, that's a different story. The question is whether his claim is justified based on his upbringing.\n\nIn many cases, people who are adopted into a culture can identify with it. For example, someone adopted into a Korean family can be considered Korean in terms of cultural identity. So the boyfriend's assertion of being Italian because he was raised in that environment might be valid. The author is focusing on the biological aspect, but cultural identity isn't always about blood.\n\nBut maybe the author is right to be upset if the boyfriend is using it inauthentically or taking pride in something that's not his by ancestry. However, the boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised as Italian, so his connection is through her. If the mother is considered Italian because of her upbringing, then the son might as well.\n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend is being honest. If he's transparent about the fact that his biological roots aren't Italian but he was raised in that culture, then it's not inauthentic. The author's issue is that he's not being explicit about the lack of blood relation, just claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's answer of being raised Italian might be sufficient for him, but the author wants more transparency. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that their boyfriend is being deceptive. But maybe the boyfriend isn't wrong either if he's using the term \"Italian\" in the cultural sense. The problem could be in how the boyfriend is framing his identity. If he's insisting on being Italian in a way that dismisses the importance of ancestry, that might be where the author's anger comes from. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be overgeneralizing. Cultural identity can be complex, and being raised in a culture doesn't require blood ties. The boyfriend's behavior (cooking, speaking, community) suggests he's part of the culture in a meaningful way. So the author's argument that \"just because you can cook Italian and speak it doesn't make you Italian\" might be the part that's incorrect. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is valid, and the author is focusing too much on blood relation rather than the lived experience. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a line between cultural identity and heritage.\n"
