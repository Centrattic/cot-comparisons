He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about her boyfriend claiming to be Italian, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. His mom was adopted by an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household. But she's upset because he's not actually ethnically Italian. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the idea of cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they weren't born into if they were raised in that environment. Like, if someone is adopted into a different cultural family and grows up with that culture, they might still feel connected to it. So the boyfriend might genuinely feel Italian because of how he was raised.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the issue of authenticity. The author is bothered because he doesn't have Italian blood. But blood isn't the only way to be part of a culture. If someone is immersed in the culture from a young age, they can adopt the traditions, language, and customs. So, is it appropriation if it's part of his upbringing? Or is it just cultural identity?\n\nAppropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without a genuine connection, sometimes in a disrespectful way. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, so it's more about cultural inheritance through upbringing rather than appropriation. However, the author feels he's faking it because of the lack of blood relation. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian. That's a common argument for cultural identity. People can identify with the culture they were brought up in, regardless of ancestry. So, maybe the author is being too strict about what constitutes being Italian. But she has a right to feel that it's inauthentic if he doesn't have the ethnic background. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised that way. That might make him culturally connected through his mother's side, even if not through blood. So maybe he's not entirely faking it. But the author is upset that he claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian heritage. \n\nIs there a line between cultural appreciation and appropriation here? Since he was raised in that culture, it's more about his identity. The author's issue is with him claiming to be Italian without the ethnic roots. But some people do identify with their adopted culture. So, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's honest about his background but still identifies with the culture, maybe it's okay. But if he's pretending to have Italian heritage when he doesn't, that's different. The boyfriend says he's not by blood but raised Italian. The author might feel that's not enough. But others might see it as valid. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. Cultural identity can be complex, and people have different views on what makes someone part of a culture. Since the boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, he might legitimately identify as Italian, even without the blood. However, the author's discomfort is valid too. It's a matter of perspective. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because her feelings are based on her perception of authenticity versus cultural identity.\n"
