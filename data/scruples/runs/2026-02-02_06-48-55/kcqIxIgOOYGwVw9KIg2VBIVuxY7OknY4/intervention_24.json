He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend claims to be Italian, but according to the author, he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the author argues that this doesn't make the boyfriend Italian by blood. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions. Cultural identity isn't just about blood, right? People often identify with the culture they were raised in, even if they don't have ancestral ties. The boyfriend says he was raised Italian, which is a common way people express cultural identity. The author is upset because he's claiming an ethnic identity without \"drops of blood,\" but maybe that's too narrow a view.\n\nThe boyfriend isn't pretending to be Italian in a harmful way. He's not denying his actual heritage, just embracing the culture he grew up in. The author might feel that cultural appropriation is happening, but since he was raised in that culture, it's more like cultural inheritance. The line between appropriation and appreciation can be blurry, but in this case, it's more about lived experience.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about authenticity and blood relation. But cultural identity is complex and can include factors like upbringing, language, and community. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language) are part of that cultural immersion. If the author is upset about the claim to Italian identity without blood, maybe she's imposing her own standards on how someone should identify culturally. \n\nHowever, there's also a valid point about cultural authenticity. Some people might feel that ethnic identity should be tied to ancestry. But in reality, many people adopt cultural identities through upbringing. The boyfriend isn't denying his actual roots if there's another heritage involved. Since the father's background isn't specified, maybe there's a mix, but the main point is about the mother's adoption and upbringing.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. He's clear that he's not of Italian blood but was raised Italian. If he's honest about his background, then it's about cultural identity rather than fraud. The author's frustration might stem from a belief that cultural identity must be purely based on ancestry, which isn't a universal standard. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for holding such a strict view on cultural identity. The boyfriend's identification with Italian culture is based on his upbringing and environment, which are legitimate factors. The author's reaction could be seen as misunderstanding the nuances of cultural identity versus ethnicity.\n"
