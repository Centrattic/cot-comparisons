He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in that culture but doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they're raised in even without ethnic ties. Like how adopted kids can take on their adoptive family's culture. The boyfriend's upbringing was Italian, so he might see himself as part of that culture because of how he was raised. But does that make it okay to claim the heritage if there's no blood relation?\n\nThen there's the aspect of appropriation vs. appreciation. The author is upset about cultural appropriation, which usually involves a dominant culture taking elements from a marginalized culture without permission. But in this case, the boyfriend is part of the culture through upbringing. Maybe it's more about cultural appreciation since he's immersed in it from a young age.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions: he cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. Those are cultural practices, not just ethnic identity. So maybe the author is conflating cultural practices with ethnic heritage. The line between the two can be blurry.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. If you value blood ties in cultural identity, then the boyfriend's claim might feel like misrepresentation. But cultural identity can be complex. People can identify with a culture for various reasons beyond genetics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, their feelings are understandable, but the boyfriend is identifying based on his upbringing and environment. The author's issue is more about cultural authenticity through blood, which isn't the only way people view identity. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe the situation is nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend is allowed to identify culturally, then the author's anger is misplaced. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim might not be entirely valid if the author values ethnicity over culture.\n"
