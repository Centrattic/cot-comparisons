He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he's not actually ethnically Italian. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian. She even lived in Italy and was bilingual. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian household, cooked Italian food, spoke Italian, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. But technically, he doesn't have any Italian blood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically so. The boyfriend argues that even if he's not by blood, he was raised Italian.\n\nNow, the key points here are about cultural identity and appropriation. Cultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. If someone is adopting elements of a culture as a personal identity without being part of that culture, some might see it as appropriation. However, if someone is raised within that culture, even without ethnic ties, does that count as belonging?\n\nThe boyfriend's case is unique because his mother was raised Italian, and he was immersed in the culture from a young age. He's fluent, cooks the food, and even his education included Italian. So, maybe he feels a genuine connection to the culture, even if it's not through blood. But the author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian, so she might see this as inauthentic.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural identity isn't always about bloodlines. People can identify with a culture through upbringing, environment, and personal connection. So, if the boyfriend was raised in that culture, maybe he's entitled to claim it. But the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. The author's frustration is about authenticity and respect for the culture.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, which might be valid. However, the author feels it's a fake claim because of the lack of ethnic heritage. The question is whether cultural identity can be claimed through upbringing alone. If the culture is part of one's daily life and identity, then maybe it's acceptable. But if it's just about superficial elements, then it's appropriation.\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's deep immersion in Italian culture from a young age suggests a genuine connection. However, the author's discomfort is valid if the boyfriend is using it to claim an identity that isn't biologically his. Culturally, many people identify with their upbringing regardless of ethnicity, so the author's anger might be misplaced.\n\nBut then again, cultural heritage is often tied to ancestry. If the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian, does that matter? Maybe the author is right to feel it's inauthentic. However, the boyfriend's upbringing is so deeply rooted in the culture that he might genuinely see himself as Italian. It's a conflict between cultural identity based on upbringing versus biological heritage.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She has a valid concern about cultural appropriation if the boyfriend is using the culture as an identity without the ethnic ties. But others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. It's a nuanced issue. The answer would depend on whether the boyfriend is appropriating the culture or genuinely identifying with it due to his environment. Since the boyfriend was raised in the culture, maybe he's not in the wrong, but the author's feelings are understandable. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim could be seen as inauthentic, even if he was raised in the culture.\n"
