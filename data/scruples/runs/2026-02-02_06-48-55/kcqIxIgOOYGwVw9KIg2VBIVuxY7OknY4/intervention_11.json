He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian, but the author argues that without Italian blood, he's not really Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cultural aspect here. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing, language, traditions, even if they don't have direct ethnic ties. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. So from his perspective, he might feel that his cultural upbringing makes him Italian enough to identify that way.\n\nBut the author is upset because she believes cultural appropriation is occurring. She might think that claiming Italian identity without ethnic roots is appropriative. However, cultural appropriation often refers to adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or trivializing, especially when there's a power imbalance. In this case, the boyfriend is embracing the culture that he was raised in, which could be more about cultural heritage than appropriation.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of chosen vs. inherited culture. If someone is raised in a certain cultural environment, they might feel a strong connection to that culture. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and was raised as such, so the culture is part of their family history. The boyfriend, even without blood relation, was immersed in that culture. So for him, identifying as Italian might be a legitimate part of his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that ethnicity is about ancestry and that cultural identity shouldn't be claimed without that. But cultural identity isn't solely based on biology. Many people identify with cultures they are connected to through upbringing, even if there's no direct bloodline. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with it.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he's \"raised Italian\" might be his way of explaining his cultural background. The author's issue seems to be about authenticity in claiming a cultural identity. But if he's been raised in that culture, then perhaps his identification is valid. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. Since he's not mocking or trivializing the culture but genuinely engaging with it as part of his upbringing, it might not be appropriation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The boyfriend's actions might be seen as a legitimate cultural identity based on his upbringing. The author's anger could stem from a different view on what constitutes cultural belonging. If the boyfriend isn't being disrespectful, but the author still feels he's inauthentic, it might be a matter of differing perspectives rather than right or wrong. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's actions might not be wrong either. The answer here depends on how one views cultural identity\u2014whether it's about bloodline or lived experience.\n"
