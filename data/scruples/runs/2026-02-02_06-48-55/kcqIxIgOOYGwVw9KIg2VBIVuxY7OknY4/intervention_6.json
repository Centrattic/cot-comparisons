He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without being ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up with Italian culture, learned the language, and cooked Italian food. The author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. If someone is raised in a particular culture and identifies with it, even if their bloodline isn't there, that can be a valid form of cultural identity. For example, people can have a strong connection to a culture through upbringing, language, traditions, etc., even if they're not ethnically part of that culture. So the boyfriend's claim to being Italian because he was raised that way might be legitimate in terms of cultural identity.\n\nThe author's main issue is about blood. But many cultures and people today have mixed backgrounds, and identity isn't just about genetics. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be ethnically Italian but rather culturally. However, the author might feel that he's being dishonest or appropriating a culture he doesn't belong to. But if he was genuinely raised in that culture by his adoptive Italian family and learned the language and customs, it's more about cultural upbringing than race.\n\nCultural appropriation is different from cultural appreciation. If the boyfriend is appreciating and respecting the culture, then it's not appropriation. However, if he's using it for personal gain or to mock, that's appropriation. From the details, he's taking pride in the culture through food, language, and traditions, which seems like appreciation rather than appropriation.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if she values ethnic heritage. But in many cases, people who are adopted into a different culture often identify with that culture. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being dishonest. If he's open about not being ethnically Italian but was raised in an Italian environment, then he's not lying. However, if he's making it sound like he has Italian ancestry when he doesn't, that could be a problem.\n\nThe examples given\u2014like the foster system adoption, bilingual upbringing, living in an Italian neighborhood, mandatory Italian in school\u2014suggest that his cultural ties are strong. So when he says he's \"raised Italian,\" that's factual. The author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of what cultural identity means. Unless he's explicitly lying about his heritage, it's more about how he identifies.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. If the family he grew up with was very Italian and passed on those traditions, then his identity as Italian is valid. The line between cultural identity and ethnicity can be blurry, but in this case, the boyfriend's connection is through upbringing, not blood. So the author being angry might not be justified unless he's deceitful.\n\nIn summary, the boyfriend's claim to being Italian is based on his cultural upbringing and not on ethnic heritage. Unless he's lying about his background, his identification is legitimate. The author might need to address her feelings about cultural identity versus ethnicity, but the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for how he identifies. So the answer would be B.\n"
