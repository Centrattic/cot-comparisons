He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, and he grew up in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian. The author is upset because he's faking the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood but also about upbringing and environment. If someone is raised within a culture, they might feel a connection to it. Italy is a country with a rich culture, and being raised in that environment could lead someone to identify as part of that culture, even if their ancestry isn't there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that claiming Italian identity without any blood relation is appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. However, in this case, the boyfriend isn't just taking superficial elements; he's been immersed in the culture from a young age. The line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If he's integrating the culture into his life authentically, maybe it's not appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's explanation is that he was raised Italian. That makes sense because his mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he learned the language and customs. So, culturally, he was raised as Italian. In some cultures, especially in places with strong traditions, being raised in a certain way can be enough to claim that cultural identity.\n\nBut the author feels it's not genuine. The key here is whether the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is respectful and authentic. If he's using it as a point of pride without being offensive, maybe the author's issue is more about personal feelings than anything else. However, if the author is part of the Italian community, they might feel that he's misrepresenting himself, especially in social settings where real Italians might be present.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's father isn't Italian, which means his genetic background isn't Italian. But cultural identity can come from mother's side too. The mother was raised Italian, so maybe the boyfriend's connection is through her. But without blood, does that matter? Culturally, yes, but genetically, no.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of ethnic identity. Some people might argue that ethnicity is more about culture and upbringing than genetics. So if someone is raised with the customs, language, and traditions, they can identify with that culture even if they don't have the blood.\n\nHowever, if the author is part of the Italian community, they might feel that the boyfriend is not respecting the significance of being of Italian descent. But if the boyfriend is using it as a part of his identity without trying to pass as a real Italian immigrant or something, maybe it's okay.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a grey area. The boyfriend is culturally connected, which might justify his claim. The author's feelings are valid, but maybe the boyfriend isn't in the wrong. So the author might be in the right to be upset, but if the boyfriend's identity is genuine based on upbringing, the author could be in the wrong for being upset over something that's not inherently harmful.\n"
