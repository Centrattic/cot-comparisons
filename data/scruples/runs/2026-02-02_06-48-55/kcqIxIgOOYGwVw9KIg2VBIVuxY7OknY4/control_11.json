He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he's not of Italian descent himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People often identify with a culture they're raised in, even if they don't have blood ties. Like, someone raised in a family with strong cultural traditions might feel part of that culture. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, etc. So he might see himself as Italian culturally.\n\nBut the author feels that claiming Italian heritage without any blood ties is appropriation. That's a valid concern. Cultural appropriation is a real issue where someone adopts elements of a culture without understanding or respecting the culture's significance. But there's also the idea of cultural identity through upbringing versus ancestry.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. That's a common argument. For example, someone raised in a different country might identify with that country's culture even if their bloodline is elsewhere. But does that make it right? It depends on perspective. If he's not exploiting the culture for personal gain and is genuinely immersed in it, maybe it's okay. But if others see it as appropriation, that's a conflict.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. They might value ethnic heritage as something tied to ancestry. But others might see cultural identity as something you can adopt through upbringing. The line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, spending time in Italy\u2014show deep engagement with the culture. That might support his claim to identify as Italian. But the lack of blood ties is the sticking point.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. Some cultures are more open to identifying based on upbringing, while others emphasize ancestry. It's possible the author and boyfriend have different views on what constitutes cultural belonging.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the boyfriend is not harming anyone and is proud of the culture he was raised in, maybe the author's anger is about cultural identity boundaries. But if the boyfriend is using the cultural identity to gain something or is insensitively appropriating, that's different.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is justified in feeling that cultural identity without blood ties is invalid. Some might say it's valid to identify culturally, others not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend's identification is genuine and respectful, then the author might be in the right to be upset. If the boyfriend is just adopting the culture superficially, maybe the author is justified. It's a nuanced issue with no clear answer, but I need to pick between A and B.\n"
