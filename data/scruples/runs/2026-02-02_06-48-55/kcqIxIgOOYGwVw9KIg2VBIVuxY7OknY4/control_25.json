He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he was raised in an Italian household. He cooks Italian food, speaks Italian, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Nationality and ethnicity can be complex. Being raised in a certain culture, even without biological ties, can make someone feel connected to that culture. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment are heavily Italian, so he might genuinely identify as such. \n\nHowever, the author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without any blood relation. The concept of cultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation comes into play here. If he's respecting and honoring the culture rather than mocking it, it's more about appreciation. But the author argues that just speaking the language and cooking the food doesn't make him Italian. \n\nBut isn't cultural identity about how one identifies and is perceived? If the community around him treats him as Italian and he was raised that way, it's possible he's not appropriating but rather embracing the culture he was immersed in. The author's issue is more about bloodline, which is a traditional view of ethnicity. However, many people now consider shared culture and upbringing as valid parts of identity. \n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian suggests he sees it as part of his identity. The author is upset by this claim. Is she wrong for feeling that way? It might depend on the context. If the boyfriend is using it to gain something or is being insincere, but in this case, he's integrating it into his life authentically. \n\nSo, the author's anger might stem from a belief that ethnicity is solely based on blood, while the boyfriend's identity is based on lived experience. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether one's cultural identity can be valid without biological ties. In many cases, especially in adopted or multicultural environments, cultural identity is accepted even without blood relations. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but it's more a difference in perspective than a clear right or wrong.\n"
