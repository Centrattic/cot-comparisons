He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because their boyfriend claims to be Italian, even though he doesn't have any actual Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in a similar environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and hangs out with Italians. The author feels that even though he was raised that way, he doesn't have any Italian ancestry, so he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend responds that he's not Italian by blood but was raised that way.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about this. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I should consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't solely based on blood, right? If someone is raised in a certain culture, even if they don't have ancestry from that culture, they can still identify with it. For example, many adoptees or people adopted into different cultures often identify with the culture they were raised in. So maybe the boyfriend is legitimate in identifying as Italian because of his upbringing. That would mean the author is wrong to be upset because cultural identity isn't just about blood.\n\nBut then again, there's the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. The author might feel that the boyfriend is appropriating Italian culture without having the heritage. However, if he was raised in that culture, it's more like he's part of it. Appropriation usually refers to taking elements of a culture without being part of it, which can be disrespectful when done in a superficial way. In this case, the boyfriend has a deep integration into the culture through upbringing, so maybe it's more appreciation than appropriation.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's intent. If he's been raised as Italian and identifies with it, he's not lying about his culture, even if he's not ethnically Italian. The author's issue is with him claiming to be Italian without blood, but cultural identity is distinct from ethnic heritage. So perhaps the author's anger is misplaced because the boyfriend is being honest about his cultural background.\n\nHowever, maybe the author has a valid point if the boyfriend is making exaggerated claims about his ethnicity where blood matters. For instance, if the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian in contexts where heritage is important, like family history or genealogy, then the author might have a point. But if it's just about cultural identity and upbringing, then it's acceptable.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's family history: his mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian, so there's a connection through her. Even if the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian, his mother's cultural upbringing has influenced him. That might be a valid reason for him to identify as Italian. So the author's anger could be about something that's not entirely wrong.\n\nIn some cases, people from multicultural backgrounds identify with multiple cultures without being of that ethnic origin. It's about how the individual perceives themselves. So if the boyfriend is comfortable with his Italian identity and it's a significant part of his upbringing, then it's his right to claim that identity.\n\nBut maybe the author feels that the boyfriend is being disingenuous. The boyfriend says he's not by blood but raised Italian, so he's being honest. The author might not like it, but if the boyfriend is transparent about his background, then there's no deception. The author's issue is more about cultural authenticity, which can be subjective.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author's anger might not be justified because cultural identity isn't solely based on blood. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment give him a legitimate connection to Italian culture. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend's actions might not be wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identification is valid, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the situation isn't entirely clear-cut.\n\nWait, the options are AITA (Am I the Asshole) style. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is either A or B. Based on the analysis, the boyfriend's cultural identification is valid, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend isn't wrong either. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes even if both sides have valid points, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to decide based on the reasoning. If the boyfriend's identification is legitimate, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, no\u2014if the author is not wrong, then B is correct. Wait, the options are AITA for being angry. If the author is not in the wrong, then B is correct. But maybe the other way around. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the author's anger is valid, then the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). If the author is wrong to be angry, then A. Based on the reasoning that cultural identity isn't just about blood, the author's anger might be unfounded. But the author could argue that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture. However, cultural appropriation is usually when someone takes elements from a culture without being part of it, which can be problematic when done in a way that's disrespectful. In this case, the boyfriend has a deep cultural connection through upbringing, so it's more like cultural appreciation. Therefore, the author's anger might be misplaced, making the author in the wrong (A). Wait, but maybe the author is right to question the boyfriend's claim if the boyfriend is making a false ethnic claim. But if the boyfriend is identifying culturally, not ethnically, then it's okay. The author's issue is that the boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. So if the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian ethnically, then the author is right. But if he's claiming to be part of the Italian culture, then it's okay. The problem is ambiguity in what the boyfriend is claiming. The boyfriend says he's not by blood but was raised Italian. So he's being honest. The author is upset that he's claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically. But if the boyfriend is clear about that, then the author's anger is unfounded. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the boyfriend's identification is valid. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe key points: The boyfriend's family was raised Italian culturally, not ethnically. He's using his cultural upbringing to identify as Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have blood. The boyfriend is transparent about his background. The author's anger is about cultural appropriation, but since the boyfriend has a deep cultural connection, it's not appropriation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A. Wait, but if the author is not wrong, then answer B. This is tricky. I need to make sure. In many discussions, cultural identity doesn't require blood. So the boyfriend's identification is valid. Therefore, the author is wrong to be angry. So the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is right because the boyfriend is making a false claim about his ethnicity. But if the boyfriend is clear that it's cultural, then the author is overreacting. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong. Hmm. I think I need to go with answer B because the author has a valid concern about cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend's situation is more about cultural upbringing. However, in some cases, people can identify with a culture even without blood. So the author's anger may not be entirely wrong. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger is justified, then the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). If the author is wrong to be angry, then A. I think in this case, the author's concern is valid if the boyfriend is using the identity in a way that's inaccurate or appropriative. However, given the boyfriend's upbringing, it's more about cultural identity. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
