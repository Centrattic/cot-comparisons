He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment too. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel he's appropriating the culture without being blood-related. The boyfriend says he's \"raised Italian,\" not by blood. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about blood. If someone is raised in a culture, speaks the language, and participates in traditions, they might see themselves as part of that culture. On the other hand, others might think that claiming a heritage without any biological ties is appropriation, especially if it's not acknowledged.\n\nThe boyfriend's case is a bit unique because his mother was adopted and raised in an Italian household. He grew up in that environment too. So he has a strong cultural connection through upbringing. But the author feels it's not genuine because there's no blood relation. It's possible the author values ethnic heritage more strictly, while the boyfriend and others might see cultural upbringing as sufficient.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The boyfriend isn't mocking or caricaturing the culture; he's embracing it through his upbringing. The author might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry, which is a common view in many societies. However, others argue that culture is about lived experience and community, not just genetics.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the boyfriend presents himself. If he's open about being raised Italian but not by blood, it's more honest. But if he's pretending to be ethnically Italian without clarifying, that's different. The author says he \"beats around the bush\" when they complain, which suggests he's not fully transparent. That lack of clarity could be a point of contention.\n\nAppropriation vs. appreciation is another factor. The boyfriend is cooking, speaking the language, and participating in the culture. If done respectfully and with understanding, it's appreciation. But if it's done without acknowledgment of the lack of roots, it could be seen as appropriation. The author might feel he's taking the benefits of the culture without the historical or familial ties.\n\nIn many cases, people do identify with a culture they were raised in, even without blood ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. So the boyfriend's identification as Italian through upbringing could be valid in his eyes. However, the author's discomfort is valid if they feel it's inauthentic.\n\nIt's also about personal values. The author might place importance on biological heritage, while the boyfriend prioritizes cultural upbringing. Both perspectives are legitimate, but the disagreement arises from differing standards of what constitutes cultural identity.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whose perspective you take. If the boyfriend is transparent about his upbringing and not denying his non-Italian bloodline, he's not necessarily wrong. The author's feelings are valid if they value biological ties more. But if the boyfriend is being deceptive about his background, that's an issue. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on the validity of their grievance. If the boyfriend is honest about his cultural upbringing, then the author's anger might be misplaced. However, if the boyfriend is being misleading, the author has a point. The answer here might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the boyfriend's claim could be seen as appropriation if not properly acknowledged.\n"
