He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and grew up Italian, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. If someone is raised in a certain culture, even without blood relation, they might still identify with it. The boyfriend's mother was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, and he grew up in that environment. So, he might genuinely feel Italian culturally.\n\nBut the author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without the blood. That's where the conflict lies. Is it okay to identify with a culture you were raised in, even if you don't have ancestry? Some might argue that cultural appreciation is valid, but others might see it as appropriation, especially if it's used to claim heritage without the connection.\n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian is a key point. If he's been part of that culture his whole life, maybe he sees it as part of his identity. However, the author finds it hypocritical or disingenuous. The question is whether the boyfriend's self-identification is justified. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, living in an Italian neighborhood\u2014all align with cultural practices. But blood can be a point of contention for some people. The author might feel that ethnicity is about ancestry, not just upbringing. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The boyfriend might not be in the wrong for identifying with the culture he was raised in. The author's feelings are valid, though. But does that make the author in the wrong? The boyfriend isn't acting stereotypically or mocking the culture; he's embracing it. So maybe the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is legitimate from his perspective. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration stems from authenticity. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, even without ancestry, maybe he's not wrong. The author's anger could be about the perceived inauthenticity, but others might see cultural identity as more fluid. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether cultural identity is based on upbringing or ancestry. If the boyfriend was raised Italian and identifies that way, he's not wrong. The author's feelings are understandable but may not make him in the wrong. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset about cultural identification through upbringing rather than blood.\n"
