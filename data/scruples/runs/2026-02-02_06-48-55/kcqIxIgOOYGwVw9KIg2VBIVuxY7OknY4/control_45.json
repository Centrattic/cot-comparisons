He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend was also raised in an Italian environment, with his mother's influence and living in an Italian neighborhood. His school even had mandatory Italian classes. So he grew up immersed in Italian culture.\n\nThe author is upset because he identifies as Italian and takes pride in that culture, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The key point here is the definition of cultural identity. For some people, cultural identity is tied to heritage and bloodline, while others see it as a matter of upbringing, practices, and environment. The boyfriend might believe that being raised in an Italian household and participating in the culture makes him Italian, even without biological ties.\n\nThe author feels that claiming Italian identity without being of Italian descent is appropriation. They argue that just because someone can cook Italian food or speak the language doesn't make them Italian. But the boyfriend's perspective is that his upbringing and environment are enough. \n\nI need to consider cultural perspectives here. In many cases, especially with adopted or mixed backgrounds, people may identify with a culture they were raised in, even if it's not their ethnic background. The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so maybe he sees his identity similarly. This could be a case of cultural assimilation or adoption.\n\nThe author's frustration stems from a belief that cultural identity requires blood relations. However, others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted through environment and upbringing. It's a bit of a conflict in values. The author might be prioritizing ethnic heritage, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, it's about personal values and how one defines cultural identity. If the author feels that claiming a culture without biological ties is appropriation, that's a valid perspective for them. But whether they're in the wrong depends on societal norms. Some might say that cultural appreciation is okay, while others might see it as inauthentic if there's no blood relation. However, in many cases, people who grow up in a culture are accepted as part of it, especially if they were raised in that environment.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (cooking Italian food, speaking the language, etc.) are genuine practices of the culture, which he learned through his upbringing. The fact that his mother was adopted into an Italian family complicates the bloodline argument. So, maybe the boyfriend is using the term \"Italian\" in a cultural rather than ethnic sense. \n\nThe author's issue is with the term \"claiming to be Italian\" when it's more about cultural identity. Depending on how strict one is about defining cultural identity, the author could see it as misleading. However, in many communities, especially those with strong cultural practices, being raised in that culture can be sufficient for identity. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how one defines Italian identity. If it's strictly by blood, then the author's position is understandable. But if cultural upbringing is enough, then the boyfriend's identity is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for having their perspective, but the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for his either. It's a matter of differing views on cultural identity.\n"
