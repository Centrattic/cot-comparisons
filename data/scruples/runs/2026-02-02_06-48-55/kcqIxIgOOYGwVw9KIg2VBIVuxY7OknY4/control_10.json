He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend isn't actually Italian but claims to be. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and even spent time in Italy. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and was raised with Italian culture, learning the language through school. He cooks Italian food and identifies as Italian, but has no actual Italian blood. The author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian by culture but not by blood, and they feel he's appropriating the culture.\n\nNow, the key points here are cultural identity versus blood relation. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, and lives the culture. But the author feels that just because you can cook Italian food or speak the language doesn't make someone Italian. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, even if not by blood. The author is upset about the cultural appropriation aspect.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. Generally, it refers to adopting elements of a culture by someone not part of that culture, often in ways that can be disrespectful or trivializing. However, in this case, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture from a young age, which is more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. But does that change the perspective?\n\nThe author's issue is with the claim of being Italian without the blood. The boyfriend's mother had a deep cultural connection, so the boyfriend might feel a genuine connection through upbringing. However, the author might see it as inauthentic because it's not through ancestry. This is a matter of differing values. Some people value cultural identity through upbringing, others through heritage.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, people can have different opinions on what constitutes cultural identity. The author's feelings are valid if they believe that cultural claims should be based on ancestry. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is that culture is passed down through upbringing, even if there's no blood relation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut issue. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author's reaction stems from a personal belief about cultural authenticity, it's more about individual perspective. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as genuine cultural participation rather than appropriation, especially given his deep immersion. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for their feelings, but the situation is subjective. However, considering the boyfriend's upbringing and cultural integration, maybe the author's stance is a bit too rigid. But I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but there's a nuance here.\n"
