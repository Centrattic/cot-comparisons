He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood, due to his mother's adoption by an Italian family. The author is upset because he feels the boyfriend is appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, so she grew up in that culture. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. He doesn't have Italian blood, but he was immersed in the culture from a young age.\n\nThe author argues that just because someone is raised in a culture doesn't make them ethnically part of it. They feel he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian without the blood. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, which makes him culturally Italian. The author is upset when he claims to be Italian in social settings and brushes off their complaints.\n\nNow, considering cultural identity. Some people identify with the culture they were raised in, even if their ethnicity doesn't match. For example, someone might be ethnically non-White but raised in a predominantly White community and identify with that culture. It's a personal choice. But cultural appropriation is different from cultural appreciation. Appropriation usually involves taking elements from a marginalized culture without permission or understanding, often in a way that's disrespectful. In this case, the boyfriend is part of the community through upbringing and seems to respect the culture by cooking, speaking the language, etc. It's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nHowever, the author's issue is about the accuracy of claiming a nationality. Nationality can be tied to ethnicity, citizenship, or cultural identity. If someone was raised in a culture and identifies with it, they might consider themselves part of that culture. But if there's a legal or ethnic definition that requires blood, then the boyfriend's claim might be factually incorrect. However, in many contexts, cultural identity is self-defined. For example, someone can be of mixed race but identify with one culture more if they were raised that way.\n\nThe line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. Since the boyfriend is immersed in the culture and not mocking it, it's more like appreciation. But the author feels it's appropriation because of the lack of blood. The problem is about the definition of 'Italian'\u2014if it's about ethnicity, he's not. If it's about cultural upbringing, he could be considered Italian.\n\nThe author's anger is about authenticity and possibly a sense of betrayal. They might feel that the boyfriend is hiding his non-Italian background. But the boyfriend isn't hiding it; he's explaining his upbringing. He's not pretending to be ethnically Italian but culturally. The author might be conflating cultural identity with ethnicity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is transparent about his cultural upbringing, then the author's issue is with how he identifies. In many societies, cultural identity is self-declared. However, in some contexts, especially formal ones, nationality is tied to blood. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being honest about his background. Since he explains his mother's adoption and upbringing, he's not lying. He's identifying with the culture he was raised in, which is valid for many people.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the validity of cultural identity versus ethnic identity. If the author is upset because the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian, that's a valid perspective, but the boyfriend's self-identification as Italian based on upbringing is also valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is being honest about his background and the author is upset over cultural appropriation when it's actually cultural appreciation, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author values ethnic authenticity, then the boyfriend is in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the context, the boyfriend's actions seem respectful and honest, so the author's anger might be misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) if the issue is about appropriation when it's actually appreciation. Wait, but if the boyfriend is not appropriating but identifying with his cultural upbringing, then perhaps the author is overreacting. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the post, the author says the boyfriend \"appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him.\" Cultural appropriation typically involves using elements of another culture in a way that's disrespectful or without understanding. But if he was raised in that culture, it's more like cultural identity. So maybe the author is conflating appropriation with cultural identity. The boyfriend isn't taking from the culture in a superficial way; he's part of it through upbringing. Therefore, the author's issue might not be about appropriation but about the definition of being Italian. If the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian but identifies as such, it's a matter of personal identity. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his cultural upbringing. So the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong) if the boyfriend is being honest, but if the author is upset over cultural appropriation, but it's actually appreciation, then maybe the author is in the wrong. This is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe key point is whether the boyfriend is appropriating or identifying. Since he was raised in an Italian household and learned the culture, it's more like he's part of that culture through upbringing. Cultural identity can be self-defined. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not accepting his cultural identity. So the answer is B (author is not in the wrong). Wait, no\u2014if the author's issue is that the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian without the blood, but the boyfriend is being honest about his background, then the author is in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
