He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend who claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in a similar environment but doesn't have Italian ancestry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't solely about bloodline; it can be about upbringing, practices, and community. However, the author feels that the boyfriend is appropriating a culture without any ethnic connection. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim might be based on his cultural upbringing, which is a valid form of identity for many. But the author is upset because they see it as inauthentic. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. Since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, maybe he genuinely identifies that way. But the author's discomfort is about authenticity through blood relation. \n\nLegally, you don't need to be of a certain ethnicity to identify with a culture. Culturally, some people recognize cultural heritage beyond genetics. However, the author's perspective is that without any Italian blood, it's not legitimate. This could be a clash in how they define belonging. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of being raised Italian might be his way of validating his cultural upbringing. But the author values bloodline, which might be a personal or cultural value. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, AITA (Am I the Asshole) often looks at intentions and fairness. The boyfriend isn't harming anyone, just identifying with a culture he was raised in. The author's anger might stem from personal values, but does that make them the asshole? Maybe not. However, if the boyfriend is being deceptive about his ancestry, that's different. But if he's honest about his upbringing, then his identification is legitimate. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Is claiming a cultural identity without blood relation inherently wrong? 2) Does the author have a valid reason for feeling cheated? \n\nIf the boyfriend isn't lying about his heritage but is identifying based on upbringing, then the author's anger might not be justified. But if the author's issue is about authenticity through blood, that's a personal belief. However, in many contexts, cultural identity is about lived experience. So the author might not be in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's claim isn't necessarily inappropriate either. \n\nBut AITA often considers if someone is being unreasonable. If the author is upset about cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in the culture, maybe the author is being overly strict. However, if there's no deception, the boyfriend is within his rights. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
