He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend identifies as Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, leading him to grow up with Italian culture, language, and traditions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people adopt and embrace cultures they're not ethnically part of, especially if they were raised in that environment. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture through his mother, education, and community. So, identifying as Italian based on upbringing is a common way people form cultural identities.\n\nNext, appropriation versus appreciation. The author is concerned about cultural appropriation. But cultural appropriation typically involves adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive. In this case, the boyfriend isn't just taking superficial elements; he's been part of the culture his whole life. Cooking Italian food and speaking the language, as mentioned, are part of his cultural upbringing, not mere appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he was \"raised Italian\" makes sense. Cultural identity can be about how you're raised, not just genetics. The author might feel that without blood, he shouldn't claim the culture, but that's a narrow view. Many people have mixed heritage or are adopted into cultures, yet they still identify with those cultures.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. She's upset because she believes cultural identity should be based on blood. That's a personal belief, but it's important to recognize that cultural identity is complex. The boyfriend isn't denying his non-Italian father but is claiming the culture he was raised in. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the boyfriend isn't doing anything unethical by identifying as Italian based on his upbringing. The author might be in the right to feel upset about this, but whether she's in the wrong depends on viewing cultural identity more broadly. The author's stance is based on a specific definition that prioritizes bloodline over cultural upbringing, which isn't universally accepted. \n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's identification seems reasonable, and the author isn't necessarily wrong to have her feelings, but her perspective might be too narrow. The key point is whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. Since it can, the author is not in the wrong for feeling this way, but her view might not be fair. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's expressing a valid personal opinion and the boyfriend's identity is legitimate, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend isn't wrong either. But the question asks if the author is in the wrong. Since her criticism is based on a different understanding of cultural identity, she's not in the wrong, but her perspective might need to be broader. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
