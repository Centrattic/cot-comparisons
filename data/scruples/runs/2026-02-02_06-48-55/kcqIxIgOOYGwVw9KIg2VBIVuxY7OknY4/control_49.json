He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's background: his mother was adopted into an Italian family, raised in an Italian household, bilingual, and spent time in Italy. He grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, his school had Italian lessons until grade 8, and he was raised in an Italian environment by his mother. He cooks a lot of Italian food and is part of Italian communities.\n\nThe author is upset that he calls himself Italian without being of Italian blood. She feels he's appropriating the culture. He says he's not by blood but raised Italian. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nSo, cultural identity can be complex. People can adopt and identify with a culture even if they don't have direct heritage, especially if they were raised in that culture. The boyfriend's case seems genuine because his upbringing was steeped in Italian culture. However, the author might feel that cultural appropriation is happening if he's not respecting the culture or if it's insincere. But since he's immersed in it from a young age, it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation.\n\nCultural appropriation usually involves adopting elements of another culture in a way that's disrespectful or trivializing. Here, the boyfriend is identifying with a culture that shaped his upbringing. So the author's anger might stem from a place of valuing ethnic heritage through bloodline, whereas the boyfriend sees culture as something you adopt. There's a difference between cultural identity and ethnicity. The boyfriend isn't denying his actual heritage but embracing a culture that influenced his life. The author might feel he's misrepresenting his background, but culturally, it's possible to identify with a culture you were raised in. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the boyfriend genuinely identifies with Italian culture due to his upbringing, then he's not wrong. The author's reaction is valid if she feels he's being inauthentic, but if he's embracing a culture that shaped his life, then it's his right. The key is understanding that cultural identity isn't solely about blood.\n"
