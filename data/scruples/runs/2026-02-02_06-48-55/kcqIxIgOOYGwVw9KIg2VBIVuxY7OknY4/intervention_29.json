He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself has no Italian blood. The author thinks it's appropriation since he doesn't have any actual Italian heritage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian household by his mother, who was adopted into an Italian family. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and is part of the community. He identifies as Italian culturally. But the author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nIs it wrong for someone to identify with the culture of the people who raised them? In many cases, people adopt the culture they grow up in, even if their ethnic background is different. For example, someone adopted into a different ethnic group might identify with that culture. So, maybe the boyfriend isn't wrong to say he's Italian in a cultural sense.\n\nThe author's issue is that the boyfriend is \"appropriating\" the culture. But if he's been immersed in it his whole life, is it appropriation or just cultural identity? Cultural appropriation usually refers to adopting elements of a culture that's not one's own in a way that's disrespectful or superficial. Here, the boyfriend has deep roots in the culture through upbringing, so it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nThe author might be feeling that ethnicity is the main determinant of cultural identity, but that's not always the case. People can have strong cultural ties without ethnic background. The boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing and cultural experiences, even if he's not ethnically Italian. The author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of cultural identity versus ethnicity.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for being upset about something that's a valid cultural identity for the boyfriend. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, no, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong for being angry, then the answer is A. But if the author isn't in the wrong, then B. \n\nSince the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid based on his upbringing, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So the answer would be A. Wait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe I need to re-express.\n\nIf the boyfriend is correctly identifying with the culture he was raised in, then the author is wrong to be upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But some might argue that ethnicity matters. However, cultural identity is often about how you were raised and how you identify, not just blood. So the correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
