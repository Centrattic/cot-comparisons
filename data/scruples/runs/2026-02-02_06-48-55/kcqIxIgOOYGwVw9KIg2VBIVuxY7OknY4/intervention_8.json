He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims Italian heritage without any blood relation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author feels he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be complex. Even though he doesn't have Italian blood, he was raised in an Italian environment, which might lead him to identify culturally as Italian. But the question is about appropriation. Cultural appropriation is usually when someone from a dominant culture adopts elements of a marginalized culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's significance. Here, the boyfriend is part of the Italian culture through upbringing, so it's not exactly appropriation in the traditional sense. However, the author might feel that he's being deceptive by claiming heritage without biological ties.\n\nOn the other hand, people can identify with a culture they were raised in, even without blood relations. The boyfriend's environment and upbringing are deeply Italian, so he might see himself as Italian culturally. The author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian, but cultural identity isn't solely about blood. The key point is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. He says he's raised Italian, which might be his way of explaining his cultural background without implying ethnic heritage. The author's issue seems to be with the idea that claiming cultural identity without ethnic roots is wrong, but that's a nuanced topic. Some people argue that culture and ethnicity are separate; you can belong to a culture even if not ethnically part of it. However, others might feel that ethnic identity is tied to ancestry. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid if she feels her boyfriend is misleading others about his heritage, but if he's honest about his upbringing, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The boyfriend might not see his cultural identity as something he can claim without blood ties. The author's perspective is about the importance of biological heritage in cultural identity, while the boyfriend's is about cultural upbringing. Whether the author is wrong depends on how one views cultural versus ethnic identity. If the boyfriend is clear about his background, maybe the author is overreacting. But if he's presenting himself as ethnically Italian without clarification, then there's an issue. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim might be seen as cultural appropriation if he's emphasizing ethnic heritage without it.\n"
