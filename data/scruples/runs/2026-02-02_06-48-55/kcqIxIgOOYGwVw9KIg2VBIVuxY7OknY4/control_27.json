He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian, but the author thinks he's faking it because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend's mother was raised by an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household. They cooked Italian food, spoke the language, and lived in an Italian neighborhood. The boyfriend was raised in this environment, even though he doesn't have any Italian blood. The author is upset because he claims to be Italian, and she feels like he's appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault here. The key points to consider are cultural identity, the role of upbringing versus ancestry, and the concept of cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing and environment rather than bloodline. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel that's their true identity. So, the boyfriend might feel Italian because that's how he was raised. The author is upset because she thinks it's not legitimate without blood ties. But is that a valid reason for him to not identify as Italian?\n\nThen there's the idea of cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is when someone adopts elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, often in a way that's offensive or stereotypical. However, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture from a young age, speaks the language, and cooks traditional food. This seems more like cultural appreciation or integration rather than appropriation. But the author perceives it as appropriation because he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian, even if not by blood. This is a common debate. In many countries, people who are adopted or raised in a different culture can identify with that culture. For example, in the US, someone with an immigrant parent raised in that immigrant's culture might identify with that background even if they have mixed heritage. So, maybe the boyfriend is just expressing his cultural upbringing.\n\nThe author's issue is with the claim of being Italian when there's no blood relation. But cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. It can be about how one is raised and the community they belong to. So, if the boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, he might genuinely feel Italian. The author's anger stems from her perspective that blood is necessary, but that's not the case for everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, some people do prioritize ancestry for cultural identity. The author could feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself, which is a valid concern if he's using it for something like claiming heritage for benefits or making light of the cultural significance. However, in this case, he's just talking about his upbringing and sharing the culture through cooking and language. It doesn't seem malicious.\n\nThe boyfriend's response to the author's complaints is to say he's \"raised Italian,\" which might not fully address her concerns. Maybe the author feels that the blood aspect is important for authenticity. But unless the boyfriend is making claims that require ethnic heritage (like applying for citizenship or claiming a family history that's not his), it's more about personal identity.\n\nSo, the core issue is the author's definition of what makes someone Italian. If the boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing and not trying to deny his mother's adoption, then he's being transparent. The author's discomfort might be about the idea of cultural authenticity, but cultural identity can be subjective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend is acting based on his upbringing and the author's issue is a matter of perspective, it's more about differing views on cultural identity. The author isn't wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying as Italian. So the answer might be B, that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
