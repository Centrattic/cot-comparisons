He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nSo the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He grew up in that environment, learned the language, and even had Italian in school. He cooks Italian food and is around Italians a lot. But the author is upset that he claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity versus ethnicity. Sometimes people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have the biological heritage. So the boyfriend might feel Italian because that's how he was brought up. But the author feels that he's appropriating the culture since he's not of Italian descent.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. That could be a valid point because culture isn't just about blood. However, the author's issue is that he claims to be Italian without any blood, which she sees as inauthentic.\n\nI should think about whether cultural appropriation is the right term here. Appropriation usually involves taking elements from a culture without understanding or respecting them, but in this case, he was immersed in the culture. It might be more about personal identity and how he presents himself.\n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that he's being insincere or dishonest. She might value ethnic heritage as part of cultural identity, while he values the cultural upbringing. It's a clash in perspectives.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she has a right to feel that way if she believes in the importance of ethnic heritage. But the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is based on his upbringing. Neither is necessarily wrong, but they have different views. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for her reaction. Since the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing and he's not pretending to have the heritage, maybe the author's anger is misplaced. However, cultural sensitivity is important. It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, people can identify with a culture they were raised in, so the boyfriend isn't wrong to say he's Italian in a cultural sense. The author might be wrong to be angry if she's not respecting his cultural identity, even if he doesn't have the blood. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid, then the author isn't in the wrong for her feelings, but maybe she's overreacting. Hmm. Alternatively, since the boyfriend is being honest about his upbringing, the author is in the wrong for being upset. But the answer depends on whether self-identification is sufficient. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the boyfriend is making a claim that the author perceives as inauthentic. But others might argue the opposite. I need to decide based on typical arguments. In many cases, people who are raised in a culture can identify with it. So the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. Therefore, the author might be wrong to be angry. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, then answer B. If she is, answer A. Since cultural identity is subjective, the author's feelings are valid, but maybe not in the wrong. I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong because the boyfriend is not being entirely authentic in his claim, but this is a nuanced situation. However, some might say that cultural identity isn't about blood, so the author is wrong to be upset. But the author's perspective is that blood matters. It's a matter of opinion. The answer is B.\n"
