He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. The author feels that the boyfriend is appropriating the Italian culture without being ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and was raised Italian. The boyfriend, in turn, was raised in an Italian household by his mother, even though his father isn't Italian. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and identifies culturally as Italian. The author is upset because the boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian is enough.\n\nNow, the concept of cultural identity versus ethnic heritage comes into play here. In many cultures, especially those with strong family traditions, people who grow up in a household practicing those traditions might identify with that culture even if their bloodline isn't directly from that region. For example, someone raised in a Jewish household might identify as Jewish culturally even if their family isn't ethnically Jewish. Similarly, in this case, the boyfriend's upbringing in an Italian household with Italian practices could lead him to identify as Italian culturally.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that ethnicity is tied to ancestry, and without Italian blood, one can't truly be considered Italian. But culture is often about how you were raised and the practices you engage in, not just genetics. The boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture through his mother's influence, language, food, and community. This could be seen as a valid form of cultural identification.\n\nThe author's issue seems to be about authenticity and appropriation. They might feel that the boyfriend is falsely claiming a heritage he doesn't have by blood, which could be seen as appropriation if it's done without respect or understanding. However, if the boyfriend grew up in that culture and is genuinely practicing it, it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nAnother angle is intent. If the boyfriend is honest about his background and isn't pretending to have a mixed heritage but rather identifies with the culture he was raised in, that's different from someone who lies about their ethnicity. The boyfriend's mother was adopted, so he doesn't have Italian ancestry, but his upbringing is steeped in Italian culture. This might be a case of cultural identity through environment rather than blood.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from a belief that ethnicity is only determined by bloodline. However, many cultures recognize cultural ties and upbringing as valid forms of identity. The boyfriend's identification could be seen as legitimate if he was immersed in the culture from a young age, similar to how someone raised in a different country might identify with that country's culture.\n\nOn the flip side, if the boyfriend is using his Italian identity to gain social advantages or to claim a heritage for personal reasons without the actual cultural connection, that could be problematic. But the scenario doesn't suggest that. Instead, he's been raised in an Italian environment, which is a different context.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible that their perspective is narrow. They might not be considering that cultural identity can be formed through upbringing, not just genetics. However, their feelings are valid because they might feel that the boyfriend is being dishonest about his origins. The key is whether the boyfriend is transparent about his background. If he's upfront and it's part of his cultural upbringing, then it's his right to identify that way. If he's misleading people about his ethnic roots, then it's an issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's response to the author's complaints is that he's not by blood but raised Italian. That seems honest. The author is upset that he claims to be Italian despite no blood relation. The debate here is about the definition of being Italian\u2014does it require blood, culture, or both? In many cases, especially in countries like Italy, citizenship and cultural identity can be passed down, but in other contexts, like the US, cultural identification is more fluid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger is understandable if they value bloodline over cultural upbringing. However, the boyfriend's identification as Italian based on his upbringing could be seen as legitimate. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's actions aren't necessarily deceptive if he's open about his background. The answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be self-identified through upbringing, which it often can. So, the author's stance might be a bit rigid, but their feelings are valid. However, the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for identifying with the culture he was immersed in. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
