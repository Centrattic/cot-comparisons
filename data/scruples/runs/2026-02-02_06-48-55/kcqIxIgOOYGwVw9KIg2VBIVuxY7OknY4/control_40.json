He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA) for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend himself grew up in an Italian neighborhood, with Italian cultural practices at home, and even had Italian language classes. So, he was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, even though he doesn't have any Italian blood.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend presents himself as Italian, which they see as cultural appropriation. The boyfriend argues that he was raised Italian, even if not by blood. The author's main point is that just because you can cook Italian food or speak the language doesn't make someone Italian. The boyfriend isn't stereotyping but still identifies as Italian when discussing his upbringing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people adopt cultural practices as part of their identity, especially if they were raised in that culture. The boyfriend's case seems like he was culturally Italian, even if not ethnically. However, the author feels it's appropriation. Is there a line here? Cultural appropriation is often about taking elements of a culture without being part of it, sometimes in a disrespectful way. But if the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in the culture from childhood and identifies with it, it might not be appropriation. It could be cultural affiliation based on upbringing.\n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that the boyfriend is falsely claiming heritage. But if the boyfriend's identity is legitimate based on his upbringing, then the author might be overreacting. On the other hand, if the boyfriend's family isn't actually Italian, even if they lived in an Italian community, there might be a lack of ethnic connection. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic, but in this case, it's more about cultural practice versus ethnic origin.\n\nThe key here is whether identifying with a culture you were raised in is valid. Many adoptive families pass on their cultural heritage, and the child can grow up identifying with that culture. So, the boyfriend's identification as Italian could be legitimate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset over something that's part of the boyfriend's cultural upbringing. But I need to check if the boyfriend is misleading others about his heritage. If he's not claiming ethnic Italian descent but cultural, then it's different. The boyfriend clarifies he's not by blood but raised Italian. So maybe the author is overreacting, thinking that cultural practices don't equate to cultural identity. In that case, the author is in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
