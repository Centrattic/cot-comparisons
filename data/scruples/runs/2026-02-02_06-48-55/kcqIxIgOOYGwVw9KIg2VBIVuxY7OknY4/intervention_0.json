He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The author feels that claiming Italian heritage without actual blood ties is appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks the food, and surrounds himself with Italian culture. Even though he doesn't have Italian blood, he's immersed in the culture from a young age. This is similar to someone raised in a different culture through adoption or immersion, like a child in a multicultural family.\n\nCultural appropriation is generally about taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting its significance, often in a way that's offensive. In this case, the boyfriend is living the culture, not just picking elements for fashion or trends. He's internalized the culture as part of his upbringing, which is different from someone who adopts parts of a culture superficially.\n\nThe author's issue is that he's claiming Italian heritage. But if someone is raised in a culture, even without blood ties, it's a matter of identity. Ethnicity and cultural identity can be more about upbringing and community than genetics. For example, someone adopted into a different culture can identify with that culture if they were raised that way.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry. This is a valid perspective, but it's conflicting with the idea that culture can be adopted through upbringing. The boyfriend's case is similar to someone raised in a different culture due to adoption or relocation. He might see himself as Italian because that's how he was raised, even without the bloodline.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being inauthentic or appropriative. Since he's been immersed in the culture from a young age and it's part of his identity, it's more about cultural identification than appropriation. The author's discomfort might stem from a belief that cultural identity should be tied to ancestry, which is a personal view but not necessarily the only valid one.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's cultural identity is shaped by his upbringing, and the author's feelings are valid. However, the boyfriend is not appropriating; he's identifying with the culture he was raised in. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for identifying as Italian either.\n"
