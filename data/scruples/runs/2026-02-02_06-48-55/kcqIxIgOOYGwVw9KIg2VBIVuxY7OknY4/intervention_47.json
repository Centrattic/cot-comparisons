He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The author is upset because he's appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment too.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be complex. Being raised in a culture and participating in its traditions might be seen as cultural adoption. The boyfriend might feel a strong connection because of his upbringing. The author is bothered by the claim of being Italian without blood ties. But is that valid?\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend isn't being dishonest about his heritage. His mother's adoption into an Italian family and the cultural practices he was raised with give him a genuine connection, even without blood. On the other hand, the author might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry. There's a difference between cultural appreciation and appropriation. If he's authentically part of the community, maybe it's not appropriation. But if he's pretending to have a heritage he doesn't, it could be seen as inauthentic.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. That makes sense if he was immersed in the culture. The author's issue is about blood relation. It's a debate between cultural upbringing versus genetic heritage. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't about blood, while others might say it's important. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking, etc.) show he embraces the culture, but the author feels it's fake.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. However, if the boyfriend isn't misleading about his heritage but is embracing a culture he was part of, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author is uncomfortable with cultural appropriation, that's a valid concern too. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they feel their partner is inauthentic, but maybe the boyfriend isn't either. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, and he was raised the same, maybe the author's issue is more about personal preference than wrongdoing. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
