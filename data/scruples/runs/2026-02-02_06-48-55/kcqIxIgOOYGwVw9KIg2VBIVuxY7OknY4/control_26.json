He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was raised in a similar way because of his mother's background. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and lives in an Italian neighborhood with Italian education. However, the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. \n\nThe key here is cultural identity versus ethnicity. The boyfriend is connecting to the culture he was raised in, even though his biological ethnicity isn't Italian. The author feels this is appropriation because he doesn't have Italian blood. \n\nCultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. It usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, especially by a dominant group from a marginalized one. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised within the Italian culture by his mother, so it's more about cultural heritage he's part of, even if not biologically. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim is based on upbringing and cultural immersion, which some might argue is valid for cultural identity. However, the author feels he's faking it because there's no blood relation. The question is whether cultural identity can be claimed based on upbringing alone. \n\nDifferent people have different views. Some might say that cultural identity isn't solely about blood, but about how you're raised and the culture you identify with. Others might argue that without biological roots, it's appropriation. \n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian is a common argument. But the author's frustration is valid if she feels he's being insincere. However, if the boyfriend isn't mocking or disrespecting the culture and is genuinely part of it through upbringing, maybe the author's anger isn't justified. \n\nIt's a nuanced situation. The answer depends on perspectives on cultural identity. Since the boyfriend was immersed in the culture from a young age, he might not be in the wrong for identifying with it. The author's feelings are valid, but whether she's in the wrong for being angry is debatable.\n\nConsidering the context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if she's uncomfortable with the appropriation. But if the boyfriend's claims are genuine based on his upbringing, maybe the author is overreacting. However, cultural identity is complex, and there's no clear right or wrong. \n\nIn the end, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author has a valid concern about cultural appropriation even if the boyfriend's connection is through upbringing. But this is a judgment call. Alternatively, if cultural identity can be based on upbringing, then the author might be wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's claim is based on upbringing, and the author feels it's inauthentic, it's a cultural sensitivity issue. The answer is B.\n"
