He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he has no Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and was raised with Italian culture, including mandatory Italian classes in school. He cooks Italian food, hangs out with Italians, and speaks some Italian. However, he doesn't have any genetic Italian heritage.\n\nThe author is upset that he's claiming to be Italian when there's no blood relation. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. The key question here is about cultural identity versus ethnicity. Culturally, the boyfriend has been immersed in Italian culture, but ethnically, he isn't Italian. \n\nI need to consider the nuances here. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. The boyfriend is part of an Italian community and participates in the culture, but is he appropriating it or is it a legitimate cultural identity? Since his mother was raised in that culture and passed it on to him, maybe it's more of cultural inheritance rather than appropriation. However, the author argues that just because someone is immersed in a culture doesn't make them ethnically part of it. \n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, some people might argue that cultural identity can be adopted, especially if one is raised within the culture. However, others might say that claiming a heritage without biological ties can be seen as inauthentic or misleading. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language) are part of cultural practices, which are different from ethnic identity. \n\nThe author's frustration is about the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity, which the author perceives as inauthentic. The boyfriend's perspective is that his upbringing and environment make him culturally Italian. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. If the boyfriend is part of the community and has been raised in that culture, maybe his identity is valid. But if he's using it to pretend to have a heritage he doesn't, that could be an issue. \n\nI should also think about the definition of \"Italian.\" Legally, citizenship or heritage might require blood relation, but cultural identity is more fluid. The boyfriend might consider himself Italian culturally, which is a different aspect than ethnicity. The author's issue is with the claim of being Italian in a way that implies ethnic heritage, which the boyfriend doesn't have. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in Italian culture and uses it as part of his identity without mocking or exploiting it, then the author might be overreacting. However, if the boyfriend is using the identity to pretend to have a heritage he doesn't, that could be problematic. The boyfriend's defense of being raised Italian might hold if he's part of the community, but the author's concern about authenticity is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on how we define cultural identity. If cultural identity is valid without blood relation, then the author is in the right. If not, then the author might be overreacting. Given the context, the boyfriend's cultural practices are legitimate, but the claim to Italian identity might be misleading. However, since cultural identity can be complex, the author's feelings are understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim could be seen as inauthentic.\n"
