He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was brought up in a similar environment, even learning Italian in school. The author is upset because he identifies as Italian despite not having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't just about blood; it's about upbringing, environment, and how someone identifies. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and participates in the culture. That could be a valid reason for him to identify as Italian culturally, even if not ethnically.\n\nNext, appropriation vs. cultural connection. The author feels it's appropriation, but if someone is raised in that culture, it's more about cultural heritage than appropriation. Cultural appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without a connection to it, which isn't the case here.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: he cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and socializes with Italians. These are all part of his upbringing. The author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But cultural identity can be fluid. Many people identify with a culture they were raised in, regardless of lineage.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. If the boyfriend isn't being offensive or stereotyping, but just sharing his cultural upbringing, the author's anger might be unfounded. However, if she feels that the claim is misleading, especially in contexts where bloodline matters (like family events or formal identification), that's a different scenario. But generally, cultural identity based on upbringing is acceptable.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, saying he's \"raised Italian,\" could be a valid explanation. The author's discomfort might stem from a different view on what constitutes cultural belonging. There's no right or wrong here, but it's more about differing perspectives. However, since the boyfriend isn't pretending to have a heritage he doesn't (he's being honest about his upbringing), the author's anger might be misplaced.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's identification as Italian based on his upbringing is reasonable. The author's reaction could be seen as the issue, especially if she's judging him for something that's part of his personal identity and upbringing. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) if we consider cultural identity as valid based on upbringing, but I need to check if the question's framing is different. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Hmm, maybe I should consider if there's a cultural sensitivity aspect I'm missing. But generally, cultural identification based on upbringing is acceptable. So the answer is likely B.\n"
