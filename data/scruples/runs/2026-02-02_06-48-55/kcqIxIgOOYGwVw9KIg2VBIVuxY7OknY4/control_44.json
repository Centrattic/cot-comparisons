He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend who claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have any Italian blood. His mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment too. He cooks Italian food, speaks some Italian, and is part of an Italian community.\n\nThe author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian when he's not of Italian descent. The boyfriend argues that he was \"raised Italian,\" which the author doesn't accept. The key here is whether cultural identity is solely based on bloodline or if upbringing and cultural immersion count. \n\nI remember that in many cases, people can adopt a culture through upbringing, especially if they're immersed in it from a young age. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might identify with that culture even if they don't share the biological heritage. So, if the boyfriend grew up being taught Italian language and traditions, maybe he's culturally Italian even if not ethnically. \n\nHowever, the author feels that without any actual Italian blood, he's appropriating the culture. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. But if the boyfriend is genuinely part of the community and respects the culture, it might not be appropriation. The line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that being raised Italian makes him Italian. The author disagrees, thinking that blood is necessary. There's a debate here about what defines cultural identity. If the boyfriend is proud of the Italian heritage his family adopted, he might feel it's part of his identity. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is being dishonest or inauthentic. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend isn't trying to deceive. If his mother was raised Italian and passed that down, he might see himself as culturally Italian. The author might need to consider that cultural identity isn't always about biology. However, if the boyfriend is using it to claim a heritage he doesn't have, that could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might feel justified in their anger because they value ethnic authenticity. The boyfriend's perspective is more about cultural upbringing. Without clear harm or intent to mislead, the boyfriend's position could be seen as valid. But if the author is uncomfortable with the misrepresentation, that's their right too. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the boyfriend isn't harming anyone and is embracing a culture he was raised in, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the boyfriend is being deceptive about his heritage, the author's anger is valid. The answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing or if it requires ethnic background. Given that many people identify with cultures they're raised in, even without blood ties, the boyfriend's stance is understandable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. \n\nHmm, but I need to decide between A and B. If cultural appropriation is the issue, then the boyfriend's actions could be seen as appropriative. However, if he's part of the community and respects it, it's more about cultural appreciation. The author's issue is with the claim of being Italian without blood. The boyfriend's upbringing might not make him ethnically Italian, but culturally, he could identify as such. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they're upset about the misrepresentation. The boyfriend's claim to Italian identity without blood ties might be seen as inauthentic to the author. But if the boyfriend legitimately identifies with the culture he was raised in, then maybe the author is not entirely correct in their anger. This is a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author's perspective being valid if the boyfriend is being deceptive. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
