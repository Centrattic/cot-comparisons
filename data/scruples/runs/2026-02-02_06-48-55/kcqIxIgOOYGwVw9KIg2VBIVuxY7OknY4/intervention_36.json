He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and lived in Italy. The boyfriend himself was raised in a similar environment, with Italian language and culture, including cooking and community. However, his father isn't Italian, so the blood relation is only through his mother's adoption. The author is upset that he claims Italian heritage without actual blood connection and feels like cultural appropriation.\n\nNow, the key points here are identity and cultural belonging. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian environment, learned the language, and immersed himself in the culture. He's not claiming to be Italian by blood, but by upbringing. The author argues that it's not enough to be considered Italian. But culturally, identity isn't just about blood; it's about how you were raised and the community you're part of. In many cases, people identify with the culture they grow up in, even if they don't have direct ancestry. For example, someone raised in a household practicing a different culture might identify with it strongly.\n\nHowever, the author's issue is about appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It usually involves taking elements of a culture as a dominant group without recognizing the history and struggles tied to that culture. But in this case, the boyfriend is part of the Italian community in his upbringing. He's not just picking elements, but living the culture from childhood. So it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he's raised Italian, which is a valid perspective. Cultural identity can be shaped by upbringing, not just genetics. The author might feel that without the blood, it's not authentic. But many people, especially in adopted families or mixed heritage, identify with the culture they were immersed in. The boyfriend's mother's adoption into an Italian family makes her culturally Italian, and the son grew up in that environment. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from a personal value that ethnic identity should be based on ancestry. That's a valid viewpoint, but it's a matter of personal opinion. The boyfriend isn't harming anyone by identifying as Italian; he's just expressing his cultural upbringing. The author's reaction could be about feeling disrespected or that the boyfriend is inauthentic, but unless there's harm or mockery involved, it's a difference in perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is based on their own standards of cultural authenticity, but culturally, identity is multifaceted. The boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying with the culture he was raised in. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset over this.\n"
