He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, but the boyfriend's father isn't Italian. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian in school.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend identifies as Italian without any blood relation. They feel like he's appropriating the culture. The boyfriend clarifies he's not by blood but raised Italian. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nFirst, cultural identity isn't just about blood. Many people identify with a culture through upbringing, language, food, etc., even without ancestry. The boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, so he grew up in that environment. His identification with Italian culture could be legitimate through his upbringing, even if not biologically. The author's issue is with him claiming Italian heritage without blood. But in many cases, especially in multicultural societies, cultural identity can be adopted through environment and family. The boyfriend isn't stereotyping; he's living his family's cultural practices. The author might be conflating ethnicity with cultural identity. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, language, etc.) are part of the culture, not just appropriation. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being honest about his background. He clarifies it's not by blood but by upbringing. The author's anger might stem from personal values, but the boyfriend isn't being dishonest if the community accepts his identity. So, the author might be in the right to feel upset, but the boyfriend's claim isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if cultural identity through upbringing is valid. But if the author's issue is about blood, then maybe the author is in the wrong. However, cultural identity can be more than blood. So B.\n"
