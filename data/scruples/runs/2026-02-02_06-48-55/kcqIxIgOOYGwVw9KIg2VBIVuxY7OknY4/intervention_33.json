He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. I need to figure out if the author is wrong or not.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's background: his mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in that environment, learned Italian, cooked Italian food, and so on. He's been immersed in Italian culture, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset because he claims to be Italian, which they see as appropriating the culture without the blood connection.\n\nSo, the main question is: does cultural upbringing and immersion justify claiming cultural identity, even without blood ties? The boyfriend's case is unique because he was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and is part of the community. But the author argues that blood isn't there, so it's not authentic.\n\nI need to consider cultural identity. Some people define identity through heritage and family, while others see it as cultural practice and upbringing. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might identify with that culture. The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so it's a multi-generational thing. The boyfriend's claim might be seen as legitimate if he was raised in that culture, even if not by blood.\n\nBut appropriation vs. appreciation is a sensitive issue. The line between the two can be thin. If the boyfriend is part of the Italian community and participates in the culture respectfully, maybe it's appreciation. But if he's using it to claim a heritage he doesn't have, it might be appropriation. The author's issue is with the authenticity of the claim.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is \"I was raised Italian,\" which is a valid perspective. Cultural identity isn't always about blood. However, the author feels it's not enough. It's a matter of differing values. The author might value biological heritage, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing.\n\nIn AITA posts, the key is whether the person's actions are objectively wrong. Here, the boyfriend isn't harming anyone; he's part of the culture in a meaningful way. The author's anger is about authenticity, which is subjective. So, the author might be in the wrong if the boyfriend's identification is legitimate. But if the author's feelings are valid, then maybe not.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because cultural identity can be complex. However, some might argue the boyfriend is appropriating. But given that he was raised in that culture, maybe it's okay. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
