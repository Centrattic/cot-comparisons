I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the biological father and his wife's wishes. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and identity. Now she's pregnant and he wants her to terminate. His wife also threatened legal action. The author feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, let's break it down. The man was deceptive\u2014married and lying about it. That's a big deal. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't intentionally cheating. She's making a decision about her own pregnancy, which is a personal choice. The father wants her to have an abortion, but that's not his decision to make. Similarly, the wife threatening legal action\u2014maybe they think the father has some legal rights? But in most places, a man can't force someone to terminate a pregnancy, even if he's the biological father. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the child seems to be hers to make. Even if the father doesn't want the child, it's her body and her life. The wife's threats are probably not justified either, but the author isn't responsible for the husband's lies or the wife's reaction. So in terms of being in the wrong, the man is the one who lied, the wife is acting out, but the author isn't the one at fault here. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with the consequences of someone else's actions and making her own choice. The key points are deception from the man, the author's right to decide her pregnancy, and the others' overreactions. The author isn't the asshole here.\n"
