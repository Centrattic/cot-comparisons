I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he lied about being married and his relationship status. The man and his wife are pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy and have even threatened legal action. The author is choosing to continue the pregnancy despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. The man was in a committed relationship (married with children) and lied about his status. The author believed it was a monogamous long-distance relationship. The pregnancy was a result of this deception. Now, the man doesn't want to support a child, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The author was deceived about the man's relationship status. In many places, bigamy is illegal, but the author didn't know he was married. So she wasn't intentionally involved in an affair. The man's lies are a significant factor here. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the child could be seen as her right. Legally, in many jurisdictions, the mother has the primary right to make decisions about her pregnancy, unless there are specific circumstances. The wife's legal threats might be about claiming parental rights, but if the man was dishonest about his marital status, that could complicate things. However, the wife's actions (threats and contacting the author) might be seen as overstepping.\n\nMorally, the author might be considered not in the wrong because she was deceived. The man's dishonesty and his unwillingness to support the child could place the blame on him rather than the author. The wife's anger is understandable, but her threats might be inappropriate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more aware or that she's now facing the consequences. But given the deception from the man's side, it's harder to hold the author responsible. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
