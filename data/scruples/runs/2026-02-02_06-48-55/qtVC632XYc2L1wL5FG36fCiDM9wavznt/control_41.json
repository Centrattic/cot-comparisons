I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife not wanting it. \n\nFirst, the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married with kids. He lied about his age, name, and relationship status. Now the author is pregnant and wants to keep the baby, but the father and his wife are against it. The wife even threatened legal action.\n\nSo, the main points here are deception from the father and the wife's threatening behavior. The author didn't know he was married and was in a monogamous relationship as she believed. The father is now not wanting to support the child, which is a big responsibility. The wife's threats seem out of line, especially since she's not the legal parent in this situation. \n\nLegally, the author has her own rights here. The father's refusal to support the child might not stop her from keeping it, but the wife's threats could be a legal issue too. The author didn't do anything wrong by moving forward with the pregnancy after the father lied to her. She's not responsible for his lies or his wife's actions. \n\nEmotionally, it's a tough spot, but the author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice. The father and wife's actions are problematic, not hers. So, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
