I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lied about his status, age, etc. He wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife threatened legal action. The author is keeping the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a married man having a child with someone else can lead to legal complications, especially if there's a claim to paternity. The wife threatening legal action might be about claiming the husband's financial support for the child. However, the author's decision to keep the baby is her right. She's the one carrying the pregnancy, so her choice is generally hers unless there's a legal obligation.\n\nEthically, the man lied about being married, which is a major betrayal. The author was deceived, so she's not at fault for the pregnancy. The man and his wife are in a position where they have a legal claim, but the author isn't the one who broke the law here. She didn't know he was married and got pregnant as a result of the lie.\n\nThe father's insistence on termination because he doesn't want to support a child for 18 years is problematic. He's the biological father, but he's being irresponsible. The wife's threats are aggressive, but again, the author's decision to keep the baby is her own. She's not the one who initiated the relationship deceitfully.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, the wife might have grounds to claim the husband's share of support for the child, but the author isn't legally bound to terminate. She has the right to make decisions regarding her own body and future. The man's refusal to support the child is his choice, but he can't force her to terminate.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's a victim of deception and is making her own decision based on her circumstances. The man and his wife are the ones acting unethically and possibly illegally by threatening her. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
