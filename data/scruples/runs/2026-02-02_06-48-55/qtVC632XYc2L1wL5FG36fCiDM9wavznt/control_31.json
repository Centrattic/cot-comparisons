I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is pregnant with a man's child who lied about being married and his identity. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is keeping the baby despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a married man having a child outside of marriage isn't illegal, but bigamy could be if he was already married and married her again. However, the user mentioned he lied about being married, so maybe he's not practicing bigamy, but still being unfaithful. \n\nThe wife threatening legal action against the author for not terminating the pregnancy\u2014can they do that? Legally, in most jurisdictions, a parent cannot force a child to be terminated unless there's a specific legal agreement, but that's rare. The wife isn't the legal parent of the unborn child, so her threats might not hold up. The bio father is the one who wants the termination, but he also isn't the legal parent if the author is keeping the child. So the author has the right to make decisions about her own body and the pregnancy.\n\nEthically, the man lied about his relationship status and identity, which is a significant betrayal. The author is now in a situation where she's pregnant and he's not taking responsibility. The wife's anger is directed at the man's infidelity, but threatening the author is inappropriate. The author's decision to keep the pregnancy isn't wrong because she's the one carrying it and he didn't take responsibility.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer is B.\n"
