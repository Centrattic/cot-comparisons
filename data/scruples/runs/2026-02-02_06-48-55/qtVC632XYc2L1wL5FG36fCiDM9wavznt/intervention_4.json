I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who is pregnant with a man she was in a long-distance relationship with, but he was married, lied about being single, and now he and his wife are pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. The man is the biological father but is married, so his actions are definitely unethical, possibly even illegal if there's bigamy involved. The wife's reaction, while aggressive, might be from a place of protecting her marriage and family. The author, the pregnant woman, made a choice to continue the pregnancy despite the other parties' objections.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. She was deceived by the man, which is on him. The wife's threats are problematic, but the author's decision to carry the child isn't necessarily wrong. She's making a choice about her own body and future. The man's insistence on termination without considering her wishes is also an issue. Legally, the woman has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy unless there are specific laws affecting that. Ethically, her decision to proceed isn't inherently wrong, especially since she was a victim of the man's deceit. The wife's anger is directed at the man's infidelity and the situation, but threatening legal action might be overstepping. The author's stance is about her autonomy, which is a strong point. So, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
