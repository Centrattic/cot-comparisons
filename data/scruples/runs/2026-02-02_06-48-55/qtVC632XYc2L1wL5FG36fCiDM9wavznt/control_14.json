I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lied about his relationship status. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and the wife has threatened legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The man was in a committed relationship (married with kids) and lied about being in a monogamous relationship with the woman. The woman is now pregnant and wants to keep the child despite the man's and his wife's objections. The wife contacted her threatening legal action, which the woman finds unjustified.\n\nThe question is whether the woman is in the wrong. The key points here are the man's deception. Since he was married and lied about his status, the woman might not be at fault for continuing the pregnancy. The man's refusal to support the child could be his decision, but the woman has the right to decide about her body and pregnancy. The wife's threats might be the bigger issue here, but the question is about the woman's actions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, the woman isn't obligated to terminate the pregnancy. The man can't force her to have an abortion, and the wife's threats are likely overstepping. The woman isn't in an ethical wrong here because she was misled, and her decision to continue the pregnancy is her autonomy. The man's responsibility to support the child is separate from her decision to carry it.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issues are the man's deceit and the wife's threats, not the woman's choice to keep the baby.\n"
