I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married and lied about his age and status. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the baby despite his insistence on termination. His wife is threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, the man lied about being married and his age. That's a big deal. Deception like that is a serious issue. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't in an affair intentionally. The fact that he's lying about his relationship status and age shows he's being dishonest. \n\nThen there's the pregnancy. The author wants to keep the child, which is her right. The father (bio father) doesn't want to support the child, which is his choice, but he can't force her to terminate the pregnancy. Legally, in most places, the decision to terminate is up to the pregnant person. So if she chooses to continue, he can't make her stop. \n\nThe wife contacting her with threats is problematic. She's the one who's been wronged by her husband's infidelity. However, threatening legal action against the author might not hold up, especially if the author wasn't aware of the husband's marital status. The wife's actions are extreme and unhelpful. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She was deceived. She didn't know the man was married. She's making a choice about her body and the pregnancy. The man's lies are the root of the problem here. The author isn't the one who lied. She's dealing with the consequences of someone else's deceit. So, I don't think she's in the wrong. The bio father and his wife are the ones acting wrongly here. The author is in a tough spot but isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
