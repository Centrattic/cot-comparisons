I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father's wishes and his wife's threats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who was actually married and had lied about his status, age, and name. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but the father wants her to terminate. The wife called her with threats of legal action. The author feels she's done nothing wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man's deception, the author's decision to continue the pregnancy against the father's wishes, and the wife's threats. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might argue that she's not at fault because the man lied to her, making her unaware of his marital status. She's making a decision about her own body and the future of her child. The father's refusal to support the child and the wife's aggressive actions complicate things. Legally, in many places, the mother has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy, and the father's rights depend on factors like legal paternity and custody. Since the father was deceptive, his legal rights might be questionable if he hasn't established paternity through proper channels.\n\nHowever, the author's decision to continue the pregnancy could be seen as taking a risk, especially if the father is unwilling to support the child. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author was deceived, she might not be responsible for the situation. The wife's threats are problematic, but the author's actions in choosing the pregnancy aren't necessarily wrong. The father's deception is a major factor here; he's the one who misrepresented his status. The author's right to bodily autonomy and parental choice is a significant point. Unless she actively conspired to deceive or acted recklessly, she's not in the wrong. The wife's actions are more about protecting her family, but her threats are inappropriate and possibly illegal. The author's decision to proceed is her own, given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
