I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the father was married and had lied about several things.\n\nFirst, the man lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. That's a big red flag. The woman didn't know he was married and thought they were in a monogamous relationship. So, she wasn't intentionally cheating or anything like that. The father now wants her to terminate the pregnancy, which is a huge request. Then his wife contacts her threatening legal action, which is aggressive and inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the pregnant woman) is in the wrong for deciding to keep the child. The user thinks she might be, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are that the man was deceptive, which puts the woman in a complicated position. She's not the one who misrepresented his relationship status. The wife's reaction is hostile, but the author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice. Legally, she's not obligated to terminate just because the father or his wife wants it. Ethically, since the man was the one who lied, the woman's decision to proceed seems her own, especially since she's the one carrying the child.\n\nPossible arguments against her: She was in a relationship with a married man, which is morally complex. However, if she was deceived, that changes things. She wasn't aware of his marital status. Also, the father's refusal to support the child and the wife's threats don't absolve the man's deceit but don't make the woman wrong for choosing to keep the baby. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
