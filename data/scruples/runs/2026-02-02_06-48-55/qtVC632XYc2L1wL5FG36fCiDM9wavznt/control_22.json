I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnancy where the biological father and his wife are pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a man who lied about being single, his age, and his name. That's a big red flag. He ended up being married with kids. Then, when she finds out she's pregnant, he wants her to terminate the pregnancy. His wife also contacts her with threats. The author is keeping the baby despite their objections.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The man lied about his relationship status, which is a major issue. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't intentionally cheating on a married man. She's making a decision about her own body and her future. The husband and wife's threats are problematic. The author isn't the one who broke the marriage; the husband did by having an affair. The author's choice to continue the pregnancy is her right. The wife's anger is directed at the wrong person. The author's actions here are her own, and she's being targeted unfairly. The husband's responsibility to support the child isn't being honored, but that's his choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
