I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the bio father lied about his relationship status, age, and name. That's a big issue. He was in a monogamous relationship with the author but was actually married with kids. That's definitely deceitful. The author wasn't aware of his true situation, so she's not at fault for the initial relationship.\n\nNow, the pregnancy. The father wants termination, but the author is keeping the child. The father isn't interested in supporting the child. The wife then contacts the author threatening legal action. The author is confused and upset because she's not the one who should be blamed here.\n\nThe key points are consent and the author's awareness. The author didn't know his true status, so she can't be blamed for the pregnancy. She's making a decision about her own body and future, which is her right. The father's refusal to support the child is his choice, but that doesn't make the author wrong for choosing to keep the baby. The wife's threats are inappropriate, but that doesn't reflect on the author's actions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the author has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The bio father's lack of support and the wife's threats are their issues. There's no indication the author acted maliciously. She was deceived, so it's not her fault.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
