I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a man who lied about being married, his age, and his identity. The woman ended up pregnant with his child. He wants her to terminate, and his wife threatened her with legal action. The author is keeping the baby and feels she's not the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The man was deceptive\u2014deception about major relationship factors like being married is a big deal. The woman didn't know he was married, so she wasn't intentionally cheating. The wife's reaction is harsh, but it's understandable she's upset. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice. The father doesn't want the child, but that doesn't give him the right to pressure her. The wife's threats might be the asshole part here. The author is standing by her decision, which is her right. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
