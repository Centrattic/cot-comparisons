I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who is pregnant by a married man who lied about his relationship status, age, and name. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife called her threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The man was deceptive\u2014he was married and had children but pretended to be in a monogamous relationship. The woman didn't know his real status. She's now pregnant and wants to keep the baby despite the man's wishes. The wife is angry and made threats against her.\n\nThe key points here are consent and deception. The man lied about his marital status and other details, which means the woman didn't enter the relationship with full knowledge. In many places, bigamy is illegal, so the man might be breaking the law by being married and having a relationship with someone else. The woman's decision to continue the pregnancy is her own, and unless there's legal obligation to terminate, she isn't in the wrong. The wife's threats are problematic because they involve harassment and potential legal intimidation without grounds. The woman isn't responsible for the man's infidelity or his wife's reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
