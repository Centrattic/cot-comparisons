I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, the facts: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about his age, name, and marital status. He's married with kids and had an affair with her. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but he's pushing for termination. His wife also contacted her threatening legal action.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong. The man was deceptive from the start. He was married and lied about his relationship status, which is a big deal. The author didn't know he was married; she thought she was in a monogamous relationship. That's a key point. Since he was the one who was unfaithful and lied, the responsibility for the deception lies with him, not her.\n\nNow, about the pregnancy. The author is making a decision about her own body. The man is saying she should terminate, but she's choosing to continue. In many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The husband's wife threatening legal action might be overstepping, but that's their problem. The author isn't the one who broke the law here. The man's infidelity is the root cause, not the author's decision to keep the child.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's threats, it seems like they are trying to involve legal pressure without the author's consent. That's more about their actions, not hers. The author is in a tough spot, but she's not the one who initiated the deception. Her choice to have the child doesn't make her wrong, especially since she wasn't aware of his true status when they started the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The man's lies and infidelity are the main issues here, not her decision regarding the pregnancy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
