I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pregnant with a man she thought was in a monogamous relationship, but it turns out he's married, lied about his age and name. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author wasn't in an open relationship; she believed she was in a monogamous one. The man lied, which is a big issue. The author is now pregnant and choosing to keep the child, which is her right. The husband's wife is threatening legal action, but the author didn't know he was married. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should check if there's any legal aspect where the author is at fault. Legally, if the man is the biological father, he might have some rights, but since he's married, there could be complications. However, the author didn't know he was married, so her consent for the relationship wasn't informed. The wife's threats might be legally unfounded, as the author isn't responsible for the husband's infidelity.\n\nEthically, the author isn't at fault because she was deceived. The man is the one who lied. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body, so choosing to continue the pregnancy isn't wrong. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
