I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman is pregnant with a man's child, but he lied about being married and other details. He wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife threatened legal action. The author is wondering if she's in the wrong for deciding to keep the baby despite their wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The man lied about his relationship status, age, and name. That's a big deal because it's deception. The woman was led to believe they were in a monogamous relationship, which is a red flag. Now that she's pregnant, the biological father doesn't want the child, and his wife is angry and threatening her. The woman is choosing to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\nLegally, if the child is born, the father's rights might come into play. But the father isn't supporting the child, and the wife is acting out. The woman is in a tough spot here. She's being targeted by both the father and the wife. The key question is whether her decision to proceed with the pregnancy makes her the asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she's making a choice about her own body. The father's lies and the wife's threats are their own issues. She's not the one who lied; she's the one who was deceived. Choosing to keep the child is her right, even if it's a difficult decision. The father's refusal to support the child and the wife's aggressive actions are their own problems. She's not the one causing the conflict here.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that she's getting involved with a married man, which is cheating and could be seen as irresponsible. However, the fact that he lied about his status complicates that. If she was unaware and he misrepresented himself, then her intention wasn't to cheat. Still, she entered into a relationship knowing he was in her city for work, so maybe some would say she should have been more cautious. But ultimately, the responsibility for lies and deceit lies with him.\n\nLegally, if the father doesn't want the child, there might be no obligation for him to support it, but the mother has the right to make decisions about the pregnancy. The wife's legal threats might be unfounded, but that's her own problem. The author's choice to proceed is her right, so she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
