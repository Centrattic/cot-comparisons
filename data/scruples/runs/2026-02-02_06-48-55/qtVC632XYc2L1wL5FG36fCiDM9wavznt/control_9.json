I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about his marital status, age, and identity. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but the father wants her to terminate, and the wife is threatening legal action.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception from the man, the author's decision to continue the pregnancy, and the family's reaction. The author is asking if she's at fault. \n\nThe man lied about being married and having kids, which is a significant betrayal. His insistence on termination seems to stem from his lack of willingness to support the child. The wife's threats, while harsh, are a reaction to her husband's infidelity and the situation, but she's directing them at the author who might not be aware of the dynamics between the husband and wife.\n\nLegally, the author's decision to have the child is her right as the pregnant person. The father's refusal to support the child might be a legal matter, but the author isn't obligated to terminate because of his wishes. The wife's legal threats are problematic because she's not the one carrying the pregnancy. \n\nThe author isn't in a position where she's at fault here. She was deceived, and her choice to continue the pregnancy is her own. The father and wife's reactions, while valid in their own contexts, don't make the author wrong for choosing to have the child. So the answer should be B.\n"
