I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author is at fault for continuing the pregnancy despite the biological father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a man who lied about being married and his true identity. That's a big red flag. He's a management consultant who travels for work, and the author believed they were in a monogamous long-distance relationship. The man lied about his age, name, and relationship status, which is definitely deceptive and unethical.\n\nNow, the author is pregnant with his child. The biological father wants her to terminate the pregnancy because he doesn't want to support a child for 18 years. His wife then contacts the author, angry and threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate the pregnancy. The author is confused and upset, not only because of the threats but also because she's made the decision to keep the baby.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for choosing to continue the pregnancy? From a legal standpoint, the author has the right to make her own medical decisions. The father's refusal to support the child doesn't negate her right to carry the pregnancy to term. The wife's threats are inappropriate and possibly illegal, as they involve harassment and intimidation. The author isn't at fault for the man's deceit; that's on him. She's been a victim of his lies. Her decision to keep the baby is her personal choice, and she's not obligated to comply with the father's or wife's demands. The real wrongdoers here are the man for lying and the wife for threatening legal action without justification. The author is not in the wrong here.\n"
