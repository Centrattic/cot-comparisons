I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the pregnant woman) is in the wrong for deciding to keep the pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, the man lied about being single and his age. That's a major issue. He was in a monogamous relationship with the woman, but he was actually married with kids. She was misled about his true identity and status. Then, when she finds out she's pregnant, he wants her to terminate the pregnancy because he doesn't want to support a child. The wife then contacts the woman threatening legal action.\n\nThe author is defending her decision to keep the baby, saying she's done nothing wrong. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know another's opinion. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife's threats might not hold up. A woman has the right to make decisions about her own body and pregnancy, unless there's a legal agreement in place (which seems unlikely here). The father's refusal to support the child doesn't negate her right to carry the pregnancy. The wife's legal threats could be baseless, especially if they don't have a valid legal claim. \n\nEthically, the man's deception is a big factor. He misrepresented himself, which is on him. The woman wasn't aware of his married status, so she can't be blamed for the outcome. Her decision to keep the child is her choice, especially since the father isn't supporting her. The wife's anger is understandable but her threatening the pregnant woman is inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's a victim of the man's lies. The wrongdoers are the man for lying and the wife for the threats. The author's choice to continue the pregnancy is her right and not her fault.\n"
