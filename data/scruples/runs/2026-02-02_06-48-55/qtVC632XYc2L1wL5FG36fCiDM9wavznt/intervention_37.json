I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy despite the bio father's and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married with children, and he lied about his age, name, and relationship status. Now she's pregnant with his child, but he wants her to terminate it because he doesn't want to support a child for 18 years. The wife then contacts her threatening legal action and uses harsh language.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the given information. The key points here are the man's deceit. He misrepresented himself, which is a significant issue. The author was in a monogamous relationship as she believed, so the fault here might lie with the man for lying. The wife's actions are also problematic, as threatening legal action and name-calling isn't appropriate, regardless of her anger.\n\nThe author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her own choice. She's not the one who lied about his relationship status or age. The legal threats from the wife are overstepping, and the author isn't responsible for the husband's infidelity. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the deceit from the man and the wife's aggressive response, it seems the author isn't at fault. Her decision to proceed with the pregnancy is her right, especially since she was led to believe the man was available. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
