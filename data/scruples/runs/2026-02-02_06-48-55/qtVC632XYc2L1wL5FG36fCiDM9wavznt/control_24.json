I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a pregnancy is underway, the decision to terminate or carry to term is typically up to the pregnant person. So legally, the author might have the right to make that choice.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The man lied about his relationship status and identity, which complicates things. He's now pressuring her to terminate, but since he's married, the situation involves another party\u2014his wife. The wife's threats of legal action could be problematic, especially if they're not the legal parents. However, if the man is the legal father, there might be some legal considerations, but the mother's rights are usually primary here.\n\nThe author's agency is key here. She's the one carrying the child and has the right to make decisions about her body. The man's refusal to support the child in the future doesn't negate her right to choose. The wife's threats are more about protecting her family, but her actions (threats and contact) might be inappropriate and not her place.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author made a choice based on her circumstances. The man's deceit and the wife's threats are on their part. The author isn't in the wrong for making the decision to continue the pregnancy.\n"
