I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections. So, the situation involves a woman who was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married and had lied about his status. Now she's pregnant with his child, and he wants her to terminate. His wife called her threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a married man entering into a relationship with someone else could be adultery, which might have legal consequences depending on the jurisdiction. However, the author's decision to carry the pregnancy to term is her choice, right? Unless there's a legal obligation she's violating, like if the father had legal rights. But since he's married, maybe he doesn't have the authority to make decisions about the child's existence. The wife's threats are problematic because she's not the legal parent of the unborn child. She might be upset, but threatening legal action to force a termination is not something she can do. The author's rights as the pregnant person should take precedence here.\n\nEthically, the man lied about his relationship status and identity, which is clearly on him. The author wasn't intentionally trying to get pregnant; she was deceived. The father's refusal to support the child also raises questions about his responsibility. The wife's anger is understandable but misdirected toward the author. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her autonomy. There's no indication she did anything wrong; she's the victim here of someone else's deceit and the wife's aggression.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author isn't in the wrong. The man and his wife are at fault for their actions. The author's choice to have the child is her right, and the threats from the wife are unwarranted. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
