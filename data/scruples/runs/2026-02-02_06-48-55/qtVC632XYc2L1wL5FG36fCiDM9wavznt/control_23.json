I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a woman who was in a relationship with a man she believed was single. She later found out he was married, older, and had lied about several things. Now she's pregnant with his child, and both he and his wife are pressuring her to terminate. The wife even threatened legal action after contacting her. The author is keeping the pregnancy and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the man's actions. He was married and had a long-distance affair, lying about his status. That's a big issue. He's now not wanting to support the child, which is his responsibility. The wife's reaction, while confrontational, might be from a place of shock and anger, but threatening legal action is problematic. But the author's part here is keeping the pregnancy despite the father's wishes. However, the father has no legal standing unless the pregnancy is terminated against his wishes, which isn't the case here. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. The key point is that the man was at fault for the deceit and infidelity. The wife's threats are her problem, not the author's. The author isn't the one who broke the trust; the man did. So, she's not in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy. The answer should be B.\n"
