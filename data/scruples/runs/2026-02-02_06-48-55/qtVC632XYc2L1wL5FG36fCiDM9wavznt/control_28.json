I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the father was married and had lied about his status. The bio father wants the termination, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is keeping the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. The woman ended up pregnant. She's choosing to keep the baby despite the father's objections and the wife's threats. \n\nLegally, in most places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. The father's rights might come into play if the relationship was ongoing, but since he was married and not truthful, that could complicate things. The wife's threats seem like emotional blackmail, but legally, she might not have standing to make such demands unless there's a legal context, which isn't clear here.\n\nEthically, the woman's decision to keep the baby isn't her fault, given the man's deceit. She's not responsible for his choices or his marital status. The father's insistence on termination and the wife's threats are more about their own situation rather than her actions. \n\nThe main issue is whether the woman did something wrong by choosing to continue the pregnancy. Since she was deceived and the legal responsibility for the pregnancy lies with the other parties, she's not in the wrong. Her decision is a personal one, and she's not at fault for the circumstances that led to the pregnancy.\n"
