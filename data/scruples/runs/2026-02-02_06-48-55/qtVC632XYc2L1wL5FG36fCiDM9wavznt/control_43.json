I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married with kids. He lied about being single, his age, name, and status. Now she's pregnant, and he wants her to terminate. His wife contacts her, threatening legal action. The author is considering moving forward with the pregnancy and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the wife's threats might be problematic. In many places, coercion or threats to terminate a pregnancy could be legally questionable, especially if the woman is making the decision. The father's insistence on termination also raises issues about his responsibility. If he's not willing to support the child, maybe he's not fulfilling his role as a parent.\n\nEthically, the author didn't know his true relationship status. He lied, so he's at fault for deception. The author isn't the one who misrepresented their relationship. She has the right to decide what happens with her body, so choosing to continue the pregnancy isn't wrong. The wife's anger is understandable, but threatening legal action without cause might not hold up.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with someone else's deceit. Her decision to keep the child is her choice, and the others are reacting with threats that don't place responsibility correctly. Therefore, answer B.\n"
