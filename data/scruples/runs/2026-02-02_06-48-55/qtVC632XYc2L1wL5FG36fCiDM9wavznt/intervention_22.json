I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the man was married and had lied about his status. The author is keeping the child despite the man's objections and the wife's threats.\n\nFirst, the man was married and lied about being in a monogamous relationship. That's definitely on him. He's the one who broke trust by being deceptive. The author was in a relationship she believed to be monogamous, so she's not at fault for that. \n\nThen, the man now wants her to terminate the pregnancy. But she's choosing to keep it. Is she wrong for doing so? Well, she's the one carrying the child and making the ultimate decision about her body. Even though the father has a say in some contexts, since the mother is the one who's pregnant, her decision is primarily hers. Plus, the father's argument is about not wanting to support a child for 18 years. That's his responsibility, but he's not the one facing the immediate consequences of the pregnancy. \n\nThe wife's involvement is another factor. She's threatening legal action, which is problematic. The author didn't know the man was married, so she's not responsible for his wife's anger. The wife contacting her directly with threats isn't justified. The author isn't in a legal or moral obligation to terminate the pregnancy because of the wife's threats. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the man lied and is now trying to pressure her, the wife is lashing out, but the author is making a personal choice about her own body. The main issues are the man's deceit and the wife's threats, not the author's decision to proceed with the pregnancy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
