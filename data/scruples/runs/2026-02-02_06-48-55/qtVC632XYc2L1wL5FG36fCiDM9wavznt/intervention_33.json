I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship with a married man who lied about his status and other details. The man is urging the author to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife has threatened legal action if she doesn't. The author is keeping the child and feels she's not at fault.\n\nFirst, the man's actions: he was married, lied about his relationship status, age, and name. That's definitely on him. Cheating and deception are serious issues. The author, in this case, was deceived. She thought she was in a monogamous relationship, which complicates things. But she's now carrying his child against his wishes. The question is, is she in the wrong for proceeding with the pregnancy despite his objections?\n\nThe man's wife is upset and uses threats, which is understandable but not acceptable. However, the author's main action here is deciding to keep the child. If the author didn't know he was married and was deceived, she's not at fault for the pregnancy itself. But when it comes to continuing the pregnancy against the biological father's wishes, is that her choice to make? Well, in most legal systems, the pregnant person has the right to decide about their own body and the pregnancy. So even if the father doesn't want the child, the decision isn't his to make. The threats from the wife are probably illegal, but that's her issue.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted in her own right to make a decision about her body, which is a personal choice. The man's infidelity and lies are his responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for keeping the child because it's her body and her choice. Even though the situation is messy, the core issue is her right to make reproductive decisions. The man and his wife's reactions don't change that. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
