I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lying about his relationship status. The father wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife threatened legal action. The author is saying she's keeping the baby and doesn't think she's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. The man was in a committed relationship and lied about his status, which is a big deal. Cheating or being deceptive in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The fact that he's a married man with kids and lied about age and name adds to the deceit. \n\nThe author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, as she has the autonomy over her own body. The father's insistence on termination could stem from not wanting responsibility, but that's his choice. However, he's not the one carrying the child. The wife threatening legal action is problematic because she's not the one who's pregnant. In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy, and the non-biological parent (especially if the father isn't legally recognized) might not have legal standing to demand termination.\n\nThe author's main argument is that she did nothing wrong. The man's deceit and the wife's threats are the issues. The author's choice to continue the pregnancy is her own, and unless there's a legal obligation (which there might not be if the man isn't legally the father), she isn't in the wrong. \n\nIs there a legal angle I'm missing? If the man is the biological father, depending on the jurisdiction, he might have some rights, but if he's married, there could be complexities. However, since the wife is involved, and the man is already in a marriage, the author's situation is more about his infidelity and her autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's being truthful about the situation, the man's actions are deceptive, and the wife's threats are inappropriate. The author's decision to keep the child is her right.\n"
