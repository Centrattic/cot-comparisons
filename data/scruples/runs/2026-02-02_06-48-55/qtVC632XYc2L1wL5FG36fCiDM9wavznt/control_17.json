I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and identity. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but the father and his wife are pressuring her to terminate. The wife even threatened legal action.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's decision to proceed with the pregnancy. Legally, in most places, the decision to terminate or carry a pregnancy to term is up to the pregnant person. The father doesn't have legal rights until the child is born, and even then, there are complexities. The wife's threat seems out of line because she's not the legal parent of the unborn child, so her threats might not hold up in court.\n\nEthically, the author isn't in a committed relationship with the father, who was deceptive. She has the right to make decisions about her body. The father's insistence on termination without her consent is problematic, as is the wife's aggressive response. The author choosing to continue the pregnancy isn't wrong; she's asserting her autonomy. The wrong here seems to be on the part of the man for lying and the wife for making threats. The author has no obligation to comply with their wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
