I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the biological father's objections and his wife's threats. \n\nFirst, the situation starts with the author being in a relationship with a man who lied about being married and his status. That's a big deal. He was deceitful, so he's clearly at fault here. The woman is now pregnant and wants to keep the baby, but the father and his wife are against it. The wife threatened legal action, which is problematic regardless of the situation.\n\nNow, the question is about the author's actions. The key points here are: 1) The man was dishonest and in an existing marriage. 2) The author is choosing to have the child despite his opposition. 3) The wife's aggressive response.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, once a pregnancy is known, the mother has the right to make decisions about her own body. The father's refusal to support the child might not legally obligate him unless they're married. Since the man lied about his marital status, maybe the author isn't his legal spouse, so his say over the pregnancy might not hold. The wife's legal threats might not be valid if the man isn't the legal father. \n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy. She's the one who had the relationship, even though it was based on lies. The man and his wife are the ones who were deceitful. The wife's threats are inappropriate and aggressive. The author is acting based on her own decision, not forcing the man to support the child if he's not legally bound to do so. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
