I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the man lied about being married, his age, and other details. The author is keeping the child despite the father's and wife's objections. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, which is a big deal. Cheating is generally considered morally wrong, so the man's actions are clearly problematic. The author was deceived, so she wasn't in a committed relationship with the man but found out after the fact. \n\nThe author is now pregnant. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is choosing to keep the child. The user's question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the mother has the right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy. The father's right to make such decisions is complicated, especially if he's not legally recognized as the father because of the circumstances. The wife's legal threats might be based on trying to prevent the author from seeking child support or other legal claims, but the author's right to carry the pregnancy to term is likely hers to decide.\n\nMorally, the author isn't at fault. She was deceived by the man, who was in a marriage and lied. The author's decision to have the child is her own, especially since she's the one carrying it. The father's refusal to support the child and the wife's threats don't make the author wrong. The main wrongdoer here is the man for lying and cheating. The author's choice to have the child isn't her fault since she's the one who was misled. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
