I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnancy resulting from a long-distance relationship with a man who was married, lying about his status, age, name, etc. The author is keeping the child despite the biological father and his wife wanting her to terminate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man lied about being married and his identity. That's a big deal because it's a fundamental aspect of a relationship. The author was in a monogamous relationship under false pretenses. The man is now pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is asserting her right to decide what to do with her body and the pregnancy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father's wife has no legal claim over the child unless she's the legal parent. Since the author is the biological mother, she has the right to make decisions about the pregnancy. The wife's threats might be legally unfounded, but that's a separate issue.\n\nEthically, the man's deception is a major factor. He misrepresented his marital status, which is a significant breach of trust. The author isn't at fault for being in a relationship with someone who lied to her. Choosing to have the child is her right, especially since the other party was dishonest. The wife's anger is directed at the husband's infidelity and her own situation, but the author isn't the one who broke the marriage; the husband did.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, so she's a victim here. Her decision to keep the child is her personal choice and shouldn't be condemned. The real wrongdoer here is the man who lied and the wife who's involving legal threats without grounds. The author is being blamed for a situation she didn't create. So, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
