I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deciding to keep the pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and his real name. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child. The man doesn't want to support the child, and his wife threatened legal action against her.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has rights as a pregnant person. The decision to terminate or continue a pregnancy is generally up to the individual, unless there are specific laws against it. So, moving forward with the pregnancy isn't something she's in the wrong for legally.\n\nEthically, the man's deception is a big issue. He lied about his relationship status, which is a major betrayal. The author isn't the one who lied; she was misled. His wife contacting her with threats is problematic, but that doesn't make the author wrong for choosing to keep the baby.\n\nThe man's refusal to support the child is his choice, but that doesn't place responsibility on the author to terminate the pregnancy. She's making a decision that's right for herself, regardless of his wishes.\n\nThe wife's threats are inappropriate, and the author isn't responsible for the wife's actions. The author's decision is her own, and unless she had any illegal actions, she's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer should be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to continue the pregnancy despite the situation.\n"
