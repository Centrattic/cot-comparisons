I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy against the bio father's and his wife's wishes. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship she believed was monogamous and long-distance with a man who turned out to be married, in a different relationship. He lied about his age, name, and status. Now she's pregnant, and both the father and his wife are pressuring her to terminate.\n\nThe key points here are deception by the man. He misrepresented himself, which is a significant betrayal. The author didn't know he was married; she was misled. So, her decision to continue the pregnancy is her autonomous choice. The father is refusing to support the child, which is his responsibility, but the author isn't obligated to terminate because of his wishes. The wife's threats are inappropriate, as she's not the legal parent in this scenario. The author's rights as the pregnant person should be respected. There's no indication she knew about his marital status, so she isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
