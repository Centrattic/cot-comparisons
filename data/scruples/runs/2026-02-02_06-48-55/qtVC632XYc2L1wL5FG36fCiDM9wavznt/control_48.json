I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he was married and had lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife has threatened legal action if she doesn't. The author is keeping the pregnancy and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. The man was married and deceptive. He lied about being single, which is a big deal. So the relationship was based on deceit. The author was misled, so she might not be at fault here. The man's insistence on termination could be due to his own irresponsibility or lack of commitment. The wife's threats are problematic, but they might be acting out of fear for her family's future. \n\nLegally, if the man is the biological father, he might have some rights, but since he's married, there could be complexities. The wife's involvement in threatening the author is illegal, as threats of legal action without basis could be harassment. However, the focus is on whether the author is in the wrong. She was a victim of deception, and her decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice. The man's actions and his wife's threats are the main issues here. \n\nEthically, the author isn't responsible for the man's lies. She's making a personal decision about her body and future. The real wrongdoers here are the man for lying and the wife for threatening her. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
