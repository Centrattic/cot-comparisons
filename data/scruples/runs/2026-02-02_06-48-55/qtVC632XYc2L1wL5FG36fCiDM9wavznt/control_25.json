I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and other details. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but the father wants her to terminate, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and deception. The man lied about his relationship status, which is a significant issue. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't in an affair with full knowledge. Now she's pregnant, and the father (who is married) doesn't want to support the child, and his wife is upset enough to threaten legal action against her.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, a married man having a child with someone else can lead to the ex-spouse possibly seeking legal action, but that's complicated. The wife threatening legal action might be about trying to prevent the father from having contact with the child or perhaps seeking custody rights, but that's not clear here. The author's rights as the pregnant woman would typically prioritize her autonomy, especially since she's the one carrying the child. \n\nEthically, the author didn't know the man was married, so she's not at fault for being deceived. She made a choice to continue the pregnancy based on her own circumstances and desires, which is her right. The father's refusal to support the child is his own issue, but he's still a parent and has responsibilities. However, the author isn't the one who caused the pregnancy through deceit; the man lied and engaged in a relationship under false pretenses.\n\nThe wife's threats are problematic because they're directed at the author without her being directly at fault. The author had no knowledge of the wife's existence during the relationship. The wife's anger is understandable, but threatening legal action towards the other woman isn't justified unless there's a legal basis, which isn't clear here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She was deceived, made a decision about her own body, and is facing external pressures from the father and his wife. The fault lies more with the man for lying and with the wife for her threats. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
