I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for deciding to continue her pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the man lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. That's definitely a red flag. He was in a long-distance relationship with her, which he didn't disclose was part of an existing marriage. She ended up pregnant, and now he's pushing for termination. His wife then contacts her threatening legal action and with angry words. The woman is now considering moving forward with the pregnancy despite their wishes.\n\nSo, the key points here are the man's deceit. He misrepresented his personal life and identity, which is a serious breach of trust. The woman, based on the information she had at the time, made decisions within what she believed to be a monogamous relationship. The pregnancy isn't her fault per se, but it's a result of the relationship she was led to believe was legitimate.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: can the wife threaten legal action? If the man is married, then the woman isn't the legal spouse, and typically, the legal rights regarding the child would be more on the father's side. However, in many jurisdictions, the mother has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy and the child. The wife's threat might not be legally viable unless there's some specific law about third parties in such situations, which is unlikely. The biological father's stance is that he doesn't want to support the child, but if he's the biological parent, he might still have some legal obligations or rights, depending on the location. However, the mother's right to carry the pregnancy to term is generally her decision alone.\n\nEthically, the woman is in a tough spot. She was deceived, which is on the man's part. The wife's anger is understandable but not justified in threatening legal action. The woman choosing to keep the child despite the father's wishes isn't inherently wrong because she's the one carrying the pregnancy and making the decision. The father's refusal to support the child is problematic, but it's his responsibility to address that through legal or financial means if necessary.\n\nIs the woman in the wrong? She made decisions based on the information she had, which was false. Her choice to continue the pregnancy isn't malicious; it's a personal decision. The main wrongdoer here seems to be the husband who lied. The wife's threats are inappropriate, but they don't make the woman at fault for her decision. Legally and ethically, the mother has the right to decide about her pregnancy. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
