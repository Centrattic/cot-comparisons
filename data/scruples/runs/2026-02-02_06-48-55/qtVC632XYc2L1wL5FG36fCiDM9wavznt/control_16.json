I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married with kids. He lied about his age, name, and relationship status. Now she's pregnant, and he wants her to terminate the pregnancy because he doesn't want to support a child. His wife also called her, threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate. The author is keeping the baby and doesn't think she's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The man was deceptive, right? He lied about being in a monogamous relationship and was actually married. That's a big deal because it breaks trust. The woman was led to believe she was in a committed relationship, which might have influenced her decisions, including having sex without proper knowledge of his marital status.\n\nNow, the author is pregnant and wants to keep the child. The biological father isn't willing to support the child, which could lead to financial and emotional challenges for her. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife's threats of legal action might be about the husband's child support responsibilities. If the father is legally required to support the child, but he's refusing, that's a separate issue. The author isn't the one who is legally responsible here. The wife's anger is directed at her husband's infidelity, but she's taking it out on the author, which is unfair.\n\nEthically, the author didn't know the man was married. She entered into a relationship in good faith. The decision to keep the pregnancy is her own; she has the right to choose what happens with her body. The father's insistence on termination is his problem, but he can't force her to terminate. The wife's threats are inappropriate because the author isn't responsible for the husband's actions. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong. She was deceived, and her decision to keep the child is personal. The other parties\u2014the husband and his wife\u2014are the ones who acted unethically by lying and threatening her. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
