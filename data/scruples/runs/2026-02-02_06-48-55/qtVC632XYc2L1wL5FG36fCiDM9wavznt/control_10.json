I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lied to her. He wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is moving forward with the pregnancy despite their wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. That's a big part of the situation. The woman is now pregnant and deciding to keep the baby, which the father and his wife oppose. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own pregnancy, including whether to terminate or continue. So from a legal standpoint, she might not be in the wrong. The father's rights might be limited since the child isn't his, especially since he's married. The wife's threats could be problematic, maybe even illegal if they involve harassment or coercion.\n\nEthically, the man is at fault for lying about his relationship status. The woman wasn't aware of his true situation, so she can't be blamed for the pregnancy. The fact that the wife found out and is involved complicates things, but the woman's decision to keep the baby is her choice. The father doesn't have the authority to dictate her decision, especially if he's not supporting the child. The wife's anger is understandable, but threatening legal action isn't the right approach.\n\nSocially, there's a tendency to blame the woman, but in this case, she's the victim of the man's deceit. The key here is that the woman wasn't in a consensual relationship because there was a lack of honesty from the man. So, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
