I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for moving forward with a pregnancy when the biological father (who lied about his marital status and other things) and his wife are against it.\n\nFirst, the father lied about being married and his status. That's a big deal because he misrepresented his relationship. The woman was in a long-distance relationship thinking it was monogamous, but he was actually married with kids. So she wasn't in a position to consent to a relationship if he was already married. That seems like a violation of trust and possibly legal issues depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nHe's now pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy. But the woman is choosing to keep the baby. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her consent to the relationship and the fact that he lied. If he was married and lying about it, then their relationship might not have been consensual on her part because she didn't know the truth. In that case, she shouldn't be blamed for continuing the pregnancy since the situation was created by his deceit.\n\nThe wife's reaction with threats is problematic, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author's decision to keep the child is based on her own choice, especially since the father's actions were deceptive. Legally and ethically, she has the right to make decisions about her own body. The father's refusal to support the child might be his issue, but it doesn't make her wrong for wanting to keep the baby.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The wrong was done by the father for lying and the wife for threatening her. The answer should be B.\n"
