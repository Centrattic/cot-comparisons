I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who is pregnant by a man who lied about his marital status, age, and identity. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is keeping the pregnancy despite their wishes.\n\nFirst, the man's actions: he lied about being married, which is a big deal. Cheating on his wife by starting a relationship with someone else. That's clearly his fault. The author was in a long-distance relationship, thinking it was monogamous. She had no idea about the lies, so she's not responsible for the deception.\n\nThe wife's reaction is aggressive and threatening, which is problematic. Using legal threats over a pregnancy isn't right, especially since the author had no prior knowledge of the husband's marital status. The wife contacting her with threats is inappropriate and possibly illegal.\n\nThe author is choosing to have the child despite the man's and his wife's demands. Since the man lied about being married, the author isn't at fault for continuing the pregnancy. She didn't know the truth, so she's acting on the information she had. The man's refusal to support the child and the wife's threats don't absolve the man of his responsibilities, but they also don't make the author wrong for making her own choice.\n\nSo, the main issues are the man's deceit and the wife's aggressive behavior. The author is in a position where she's a victim of the man's lies and is making a decision based on her own desires, not the other parties' demands. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong.\n"
