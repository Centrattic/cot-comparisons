I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy where the biological father wants the mother to terminate it, and the wife of the father is threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who was actually married and had lied about his status, age, and name. Now she's pregnant, and the father wants her to terminate the pregnancy. His wife then contacts her, angry and threatening legal action if the termination isn't done. The author is considering moving forward with the pregnancy despite their wishes.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nKey points to consider: The father lied about his relationship status, which is a significant factor. The wife's actions are aggressive and threatening, which complicates things. The author's decision to have the child is her choice, but she's in a situation where the father isn't taking responsibility. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife's threats might not be valid. In many places, the biological father's rights come into play once a child is born, but during pregnancy, the mother has the right to make decisions. However, if the father is not willing to support the child, that's a different aspect. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, and the father's insistence on termination could be seen as pressuring her against her wishes, which is problematic. \n\nEthically, the father's deception is a major issue. He misrepresented his status, so the author wasn't in a consensual relationship from the start. The wife's actions are also questionable, as contacting and threatening someone without their knowledge is inappropriate. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the child isn't inherently wrong. She's facing pressure from both the father and his wife, but she's not the one who started the deceit. Her responsibility is to herself and the potential child. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The father's deception and the wife's threats are the main issues here. The author's choice to proceed with the pregnancy is her right, and she hasn't done anything wrong in this scenario.\n"
