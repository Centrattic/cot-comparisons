I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the man lied about being married and his age. The man now wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man was in a marriage and had a long-distance relationship with the woman, lying about his status, age, and name. She's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but he's against supporting it. The wife called her threatening legal action, which the author finds unjustified. \n\nThe main question is: is the author at fault here? Let's consider the factors. The man's dishonesty is a major point. He misrepresented himself, which is a significant betrayal. The author didn't know about his marital status, so she wasn't in a consensual relationship with someone else. The pregnancy resulted from a relationship where the other party was not truthful about his commitments.\n\nThe man's insistence on termination could be seen as him trying to avoid responsibility, especially since he's in a position where he's not willing to support the child. The wife's threats might be her trying to protect her family, but the author isn't at fault for the pregnancy; she's a victim of the man's deceit.\n\nLegally, the situation might be complex. If the man is the biological father, his rights could come into play, but since he's not providing support, there might be issues. The wife's threats might not hold up if the legal system considers the man's lack of support. However, the author's actions in deciding to have the child are her choice, especially since she wasn't aware of his marital status.\n\nEthically, the man's lies are the core issue. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, given the circumstances. She's not the one who initiated the deception. The wife's anger is directed at the man's infidelity and the situation, but her threats towards the author are inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she was misled and is making a personal decision about her pregnancy. The man's actions and the wife's threats are the problematic elements here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
