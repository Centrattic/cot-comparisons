I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the bio father was married and lied about his status. He wants the author to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife threatens legal action.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married and deceptive. The man lied about his age, name, and relationship status. The author is pregnant and wants to continue the pregnancy despite the man's wishes. The wife contacts the author threatening legal action, which the author finds upsetting.\n\nNow, the key points here are the deception by the bio father. He misrepresented himself, which is a major ethical issue. The author had no knowledge of his marital status initially. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice, and while the bio father is against it, that's his stance, but he's not legally or ethically in a position to dictate her decision. The wife's threats are problematic because she's taking legal action against the author, who is not part of their marriage. The author isn't at fault here because the bio father's actions led to the pregnancy, and she's making a personal decision about her body. The wife's anger is directed at the wrong person; it's the husband's responsibility, not the author's. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
