I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The situation is about whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy despite the bio father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and his identity. So the man is definitely at fault here for deception. He's in a committed marriage with kids, but he had an affair and lied about it. That's pretty serious. The author didn't know the truth until after getting pregnant. Now, the man wants her to terminate the pregnancy because he doesn't want to support a child long-term. His wife also contacts the author threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to keep the pregnancy. The author argues that she did nothing wrong because she was deceived and is making her own choice about her body and future. On the other hand, the man's wife is angry, but the author wasn't aware of the marriage. The author isn't the one who broke the vows or had the affair. \n\nLegally, the wife's threats might be problematic, but the author's decision to proceed with the pregnancy is her right. The man's refusal to support the child could be a legal issue if the court determines he's the father. However, the author isn't the one making threats; she's making a personal decision after being deceived. \n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong because she was misled. She's now facing the consequences of the man's actions. Choosing to keep the child is her autonomous choice, and the others' reactions don't change that. The main wrongdoer here is the man who lied. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
