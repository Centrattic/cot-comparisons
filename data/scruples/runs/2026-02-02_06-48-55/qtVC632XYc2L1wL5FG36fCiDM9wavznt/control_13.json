I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this post is the asshole for moving forward with the pregnancy against the wishes of the biological father and his wife.\n\nFirst, let me parse the situation. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married with kids. He lied about his age, name, and relationship status. Now she's pregnant and he wants her to have a termination because he doesn't want to support a child. The wife then contacts the author, angry and threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate the pregnancy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man was married and lied about his relationship status. The author didn't know he was married. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child. The father and wife are against it, even to the point of threats.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father's rights might come into play. In some jurisdictions, a man can assert his parental rights even if he didn't know about the pregnancy, but if he was uninvolved or didn't support the relationship, that might complicate things. However, the wife threatening legal action against the author for carrying the pregnancy to term is problematic. The wife isn't the one who can assert the father's rights if he's not taking responsibility.\n\nEthically, the author made a decision to continue the pregnancy. She's the one who will be raising the child, so her right to make that choice is important. The man lied to her, which led to the pregnancy. The wife's reaction is aggressive and threatening, which seems wrong. The author isn't the one who entered into a deceitful relationship; she was misled. So, she's not in the wrong for choosing to have the child despite the father's wishes. The real issues here are the man's dishonesty and the wife's threats. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
