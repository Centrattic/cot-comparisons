I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and was lying about his relationship status, age, and identity. He wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife even called her threatening legal action. The author is keeping the baby despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal angles here. The man was in a committed marriage and had an affair, lying about his relationship status. That's a big deal. The author was misled, which complicates things. She's choosing to move forward with the pregnancy, which she has every right to do. The husband's wife is threatening her, which is inappropriate and possibly illegal if it's harassment or a threat of legal action without basis.\n\nLegally, the wife might not have standing to make decisions about someone else's pregnancy. The father, however, might have some legal obligations if paternity is established, but in this case, he's against supporting the child. However, the father's wishes don't override the mother's right to make medical decisions. The author is the one carrying the child, so her decision is her own.\n\nEthically, the man is at fault for deception and infidelity. The author was a victim of lies. The wife's threats are also problematic because she's not the legal guardian of the situation. The author isn't the one who broke trust or engaged in deceit here. She's making a choice that's in her own control, despite others' objections.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She was misled and is making a decision that affects her own life. The people opposing her are the ones who acted unethically. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
