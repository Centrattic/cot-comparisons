I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he's already married with kids and lied about his relationship status, age, and name. She's in a long-distance relationship, thinking it's monogamous, but he's actually married. Now, he doesn't want to support the child and insists on termination. His wife called her threatening legal action. The author is deciding to keep the pregnancy and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the man lied about being married. That's a big deal. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so he's at fault here. The author might not be in the wrong because she was deceived. She had no idea he was married, so she's not the one who broke the marriage. The wife's reaction, with threats and name-calling, is also problematic, but the user isn't asking about her. The key question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the pregnancy despite the father's wishes.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play. If the biological father is married, maybe there are laws about paternity and support. But the author might not have legal obligations to terminate. Ethically, someone's right to their own body is often considered important, so choosing to keep the child isn't inherently wrong. The man's insistence on termination could be about convenience, but that doesn't make him right. The wife's threats are inappropriate, but again, the author's choice is her own. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author wasn't the one who lied. She's making a personal decision about her pregnancy, which many people support as a right. The main wrongdoer here seems to be the man for cheating and lying. The author isn't in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy.\n"
