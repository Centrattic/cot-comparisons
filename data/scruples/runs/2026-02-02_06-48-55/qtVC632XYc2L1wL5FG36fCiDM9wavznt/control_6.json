I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnancy where the biological father wants the mother to terminate it, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is keeping the pregnancy despite their wishes. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man lied about his relationship status, age, and identity. He's married with kids. The woman is now pregnant and deciding to keep the child against the father's wishes.\n\nLegally, in most places, the mother has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The father's rights usually come into play once the child is born, depending on the jurisdiction. The wife's threats of legal action might be baseless if she's not legally recognized as having standing to make such demands. The man's insistence on termination could be his opinion, but it's not legally binding on the mother.\n\nMoral and ethical aspects are trickier. The man's lies are significant, and the woman might feel wronged. Choosing to keep the pregnancy could be her personal decision, especially given the circumstances. The wife's anger is understandable but her threatening behavior is questionable. The author's actions don't seem to be at fault here, as she's making a choice that's legally hers to make. The real issues lie with the man's deceit and the wife's threats.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
