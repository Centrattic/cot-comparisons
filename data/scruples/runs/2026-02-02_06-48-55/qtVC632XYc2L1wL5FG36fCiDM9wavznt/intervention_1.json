I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who turned out to be married and had lied about his age and status. Now she's pregnant and the father wants her to terminate, while his wife threatens her. The author is keeping the baby despite their wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man was deceptive\u2014lying about his marital status, age, and identity. That's a big deal. Deception in a relationship, especially regarding such fundamental aspects, can be a significant factor. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't in a relationship with someone else's spouse intentionally. \n\nThe father wants the termination, but the author is choosing to keep the child. The wife is angry and even threatened legal action, which adds another layer. The author is pregnant and the child is hers and the father's, so the decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, unless there's a legal claim from the wife. However, in many places, a married man's wife doesn't have legal authority over his actions or the child's future once the child is born. \n\nThe author's main argument is that she's not in the wrong because the deception was on the man's part. She didn't know his real status, so she can't be blamed for the pregnancy. The wife's threats seem to be based on her husband's infidelity, but that doesn't give her the right to pressure the author. \n\nLegally, the author has the right to make decisions about her body and pregnancy unless there's a court order. The father's insistence on termination doesn't override her right to choose. The wife's threats might be legally problematic, especially if they involve harassment or threats of legal action without basis. \n\nEthically, the author isn't wrong because she was deceived. The man's actions led to the situation. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her own, and she's taking responsibility for it. The wife's reaction is understandable in terms of anger, but threatening legal action against someone who was unaware of the marital status might not hold up. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The main wrongdoer here is the man who lied. The wife's actions are problematic, but the author isn't at fault for the pregnancy or her decision to keep the child. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
