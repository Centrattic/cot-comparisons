I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The woman is pregnant with a man's child who lied to her about being married, his age, and his identity. He's now pushing for her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if a woman is pregnant and the father is not the legal husband, she might have the right to make decisions about the pregnancy. The husband's wife threatening legal action could be problematic because the law often protects a woman's right to choose, unless there's a specific legal bond. Since the man isn't the husband, maybe the wife doesn't have standing to make those threats. Plus, the man himself, as the biological father, might not have a legal right to force her to terminate the pregnancy. That part might be on the woman's side.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The man engaged in deceit by hiding his marital status and other details. That's a big red flag. He's now using the pregnancy as a way to avoid responsibility, but he didn't want to support a child for 18 years. That seems like a selfish stance. The wife's reaction is extreme, but threatening legal action and contacting the woman directly might be crossing a line, especially if there's no legal basis for it. The woman is in a vulnerable position here, but she was the victim of the man's lies.\n\nThe woman's decision to carry the pregnancy is her choice, especially if she's not in a committed relationship with the man. She isn't obligated to terminate the pregnancy because of someone else's bad decisions. The fact that the husband's wife found out and is involved complicates things, but the primary responsibility lies with the man who misrepresented himself. \n\nSo putting it all together, the woman didn't know the man was married and was lied to. She's making her own decision now, which is her right. The man's and his wife's actions are the ones that are questionable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
