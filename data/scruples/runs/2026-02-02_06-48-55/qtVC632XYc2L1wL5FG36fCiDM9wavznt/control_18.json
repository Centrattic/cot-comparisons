I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who was actually married with kids. He lied about his age, name, and relationship status. Now she's pregnant and he wants her to terminate. His wife called her, angry and threatening legal action if she doesn't abort.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and deception. The man lied about his relationship status, which is a major red flag. The wife isn't the one who had the affair; the husband did. The author didn't know he was married, so she might not be at fault. The wife's threats are problematic because she's not the legal parent and can't control the author's decisions. \n\nThe author is choosing to keep the pregnancy, which is her right. The bio father isn't taking responsibility, which is his issue. The wife's involvement seems to be overstepping. The author isn't the one who initiated the deceit, so she's not at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
