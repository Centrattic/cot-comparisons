I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife not wanting her to.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married and other details. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the baby, but the father insists on termination. The wife also contacted her threatening legal action.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's deception and the author's right to make decisions about her own body. The father lied about his relationship status and identity, which is a big deal. He's now asking her to terminate the pregnancy, but she's choosing to keep it. Legally, in many places, the pregnant person has the right to decide what happens with their pregnancy, unless there's a legal agreement (which there shouldn't be here since he's married and they were in a deceptive relationship).\n\nThe wife's threats are problematic too. She has no legal standing in the author's decision unless there's some legal claim, which there's no indication of. The author hasn't done anything to warrant legal action here. She's not the one who's in a committed relationship with someone else; he was the one who lied. \n\nThe author's decision to move forward with the pregnancy isn't her fault, especially considering the father's deceit. She's not the one who violated a marriage or committed adultery, as the father was already married. The wife's anger is directed at the wrong person; the father is the one who misled the author. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice about her body, and the other parties have acted deceptively and aggressively. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
