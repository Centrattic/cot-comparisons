I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who discovered her partner was married, lying about his age and name, and now she's pregnant. The biological father wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action if she doesn't. The woman is keeping the child and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the facts. The key points here are the man's deception\u2014being married, lying about his relationship status, age, and identity. The woman was in a long-distance relationship, thinking it was monogamous. Then she found out he was married. She's now pregnant and wants to keep the child despite his objections and his wife's threats.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, a married man is not allowed to have a child with someone else without the wife's consent, but the woman who is pregnant may not be at fault if she was deceived. The man's wife is threatening legal action, which could involve claims of damages or seeking custody, but the biological father is not supporting the child. The woman's right to make decisions about her body and pregnancy is a key point here.\n\nEthically, the man's actions are clearly wrong. He was deceptive and in an extramarital affair. The woman, based on the information given, seems to be a victim of his deceit. Choosing to continue the pregnancy is a personal decision and her right. The wife's threats are problematic because they involve threats and harassment, but the woman isn't responsible for the wife's actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong. Since she was deceived and the man was the one who was unfaithful and lying, it's unlikely she's in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy. She's making a choice that affects her life, and the man's refusal to support the child is his issue. The wife's actions are separate, but the woman isn't at fault for that either.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
