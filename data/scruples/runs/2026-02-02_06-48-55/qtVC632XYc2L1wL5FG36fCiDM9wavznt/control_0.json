I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is pregnant with a man's child, but he was married and lied about his relationship status, age, and name. He wants the author to have an abortion, and his wife threatened legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man was deceptive, which is a big issue. He was married, so the author didn't know that when they were in a relationship. The author is now pregnant and wants to keep the baby despite the man's wishes. His wife contacted the author threatening legal action and using harsh language. The author is asking if moving forward with the pregnancy makes her the asshole.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is at fault. The author didn't know the man was married initially. He lied, so he's the one who's deceptive here. The author's decision to keep the pregnancy is her choice, and the man has no legal obligation unless he's recognized as the father. The wife's threats might not hold up legally, especially if the husband is the legal father, but that's a separate issue.\n\nThe author is not the one who broke the law here. The man was unfaithful and lied. The author's choice to continue the pregnancy is her right, and the man's refusal to support the child doesn't negate her right to make that decision. The wife's threats are problematic, but the author isn't responsible for the man's actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
