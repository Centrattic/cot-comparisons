I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnancy where the biological father is married, lied about his relationship status, and the husband's wife is threatening legal action if the author doesn't terminate the pregnancy. The author is moving forward with the pregnancy despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The key points here are the lies the husband told, the wife's reaction, and the author's decision to continue the pregnancy. \n\nThe husband is married, which means the author was deceived about his relationship status. If he was married and lied about being in a monogamous relationship, that's a significant ethical issue. The wife's actions\u2014threatening legal action\u2014might be problematic. In many places, a spouse doesn't have legal authority to force an abortion on another person. So, the wife's threats could be legally baseless and possibly even illegal. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the pregnancy is a personal choice. Unless there's a legal obligation (which might not exist here, especially if the husband is not providing support), she has the right to choose. The husband's insistence on termination without any legal standing might not hold up. \n\nEthically, the husband's deceit is a major issue. He misrepresented himself, which led to the author's pregnancy. The wife's threats are aggressive and possibly inappropriate. The author isn't in a legal or ethical position where she's obligated to terminate the pregnancy because she wasn't aware of his marital status and the husband's actions were deceptive. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that the author is complicating an existing marriage, but since the husband was the one lying about his status, the responsibility isn't entirely hers. Others might think the wife's threats are justified, but legally, she's stepping over boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She had the right to make her own decision, and the husband's and wife's actions are problematic due to deceit and threats. So, the answer should be B.\n"
