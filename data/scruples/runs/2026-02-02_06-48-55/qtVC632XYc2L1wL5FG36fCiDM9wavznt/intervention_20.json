I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant with a man's child, but the man is married with kids. He lied about his relationship status, age, and name. Now he's pushing for termination, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author wants to keep the baby despite their objections.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is at fault here. From what I know about relationships and consent, if someone is in a monogamous relationship, the other person can't have a child with another partner without it being a violation. The man lied, which is definitely a problem. But does that make the author responsible? Or is the wrong primarily on the man and his wife?\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the author might be facing challenges if the wife sues. But in terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a tough spot. She might not have known the truth, but once she found out, she still decided to continue the pregnancy. But considering the man's deceit and the wife's reaction, the author's decision to keep the baby could be seen as her choice. However, the wife's threats are problematic regardless.\n\nThe main points are the man's lies and the author's choice. If the author was unaware initially, she's not at fault for the pregnancy. But once she knew he was married and lying, continuing the pregnancy might be seen as her decision. However, since the man was the one who initiated the relationship and lied, the responsibility isn't on her. The wife's actions are also inappropriate, as she's threatening someone else for her husband's actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The man is the one who's at fault for lying and the wife for threatening legal action. The author's decision to keep the baby is her own and not something she's responsible for given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
