I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the man was married, lied about his status, age, and name. The man wants the pregnancy terminated, and his wife has threatened legal action.\n\nFirst, the key points: The man was married when the relationship started. He lied about his relationship status, which is a big deal because it's deceptive. The woman ended up pregnant against his wishes, and he's pressuring her to terminate. His wife is now involved, making threats.\n\nThe user is the woman, and she's asking if keeping the pregnancy is her fault. From a legal standpoint, the husband's wife might have a claim here. If the man was married, any child born from an extramarital affair could complicate things legally, especially if the wife seeks support. But ethically, the woman didn't know he was married; he lied. She wasn't part of the deceit, so she's not at fault for the pregnancy. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, the wife might have a case for claiming that the husband's actions led to her having to pay child support, but that depends on local laws. However, the woman's decision to continue the pregnancy isn't inherently wrong. She's a victim of the man's lies. The threats from the wife are inappropriate and aggressive, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe woman's right to make decisions about her own body is a significant factor. Even if there are legal complications, her choice to have the child isn't her fault. The man's insistence on termination and the wife's threats are more about their own issues, not her wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The woman isn't in the wrong because the man's deceit is the root cause here. She's being unfairly targeted by the wife's threats, and her decision to continue the pregnancy is a personal choice she's entitled to make.\n"
