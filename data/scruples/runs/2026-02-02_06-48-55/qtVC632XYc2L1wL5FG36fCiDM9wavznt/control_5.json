I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man she thought was single. He lied about being married, his age, and his identity. Now she's pregnant. He doesn't want the child and insists on termination. His wife then contacts her threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate. The author is keeping the pregnancy and feels she's in the right.\n\nLegally, if the husband is married, any child would be considered the wife's as well, but the author didn't know he was married. The wife's threats might be legally baseless, but that's not the focus here. The question is about moral wrongness, not legality.\n\nThe key factors are consent and deception. The man lied about his relationship status, so he wasn't in a position to commit to a child. The author made a choice based on a false premise. She's now exercising her right to carry the pregnancy, which is her decision. The husband and wife's demands don't override her right to make that choice. The wife's anger is understandable but not justified in threatening her. The author isn't in a committed relationship with the husband; he was deceptive. So, she's not morally wrong for deciding to keep the child. The answer is B.\n"
