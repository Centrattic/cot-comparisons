I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship where the father was married and had lied about his status. The father wants an abortion, and his wife threatened legal action against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The man was married, so any relationship with him is an affair. The author was in a committed relationship with him, believing he was single. He lied about multiple things, including his marriage, age, and name. The author is now pregnant and wants to keep the child, despite the father's objections. The wife's threats add another layer.\n\nLegally, in many places, a married man's infidelity is not something the woman is typically held responsible for, but the author might have legal obligations if she terminates the pregnancy against his wishes. However, the main question is moral or social, not legal. The author might feel wronged because the man was the one who lied and is now pressuring her to abort. The wife's anger is understandable, but her threats are inappropriate.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author's role in this is complex. She was deceived, but she chose to be in a relationship with a married man. While she might not be at fault in the sense of initiating the relationship, she did participate in an extramarital affair. However, the fault lies more with the man for being deceptive. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, but the situation is complicated because of the man's actions.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate. The author's actions are a result of being deceived. She had no knowledge of his marital status until after the fact. The decision to continue the pregnancy is her own, which is a personal choice. The father's refusal to support the child is his issue, and the wife's threats are her problem, not the author's.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fault primarily lies with the man for lying and the wife for threatening. The author is caught in a situation she didn't create. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
