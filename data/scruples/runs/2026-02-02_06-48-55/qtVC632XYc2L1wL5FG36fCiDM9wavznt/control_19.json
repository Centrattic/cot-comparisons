I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who found out her partner was married, lying about his age, name, and relationship status. She's pregnant and wants to keep the child despite the biological father's insistence on termination. The wife of the man contacted her threatening legal action.\n\nFirst, the key points here are deception from the man. He lied about being married, which is a big deal. The author didn't know he was married, so she's not at fault for that. The man's wife is angry and threatening legal action, but the author isn't the one who caused the situation. The author is now facing pressure from both the man and his wife to terminate the pregnancy, but she's choosing to move forward. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main factors to consider are her intent and the circumstances. Since she was deceived, she's not responsible for the man's lies. The author's decision to keep the child is her right, especially since she didn't know the man was married. The wife's threats are inappropriate, but the author isn't the one at fault here. \n\nAnother angle: Could she be at fault for continuing the pregnancy? But the man misrepresented his situation, so she was unaware of the marital status when she made the decision to have the child. Also, in some jurisdictions, the mother has the right to decide about the pregnancy. The threats from the wife don't justify the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
