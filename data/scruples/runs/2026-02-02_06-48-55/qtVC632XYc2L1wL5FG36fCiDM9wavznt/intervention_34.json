I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy resulting from a relationship with a married man who lied about his status. The author wants to keep the child despite the father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the man was deceptive, which is definitely on him. He's married and had a relationship that led to a pregnancy. His wife is reacting angrily, which is understandable given the betrayal. The author is being blamed for not terminating the pregnancy, but she's choosing to go through with it. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Legally, the wife's threats might not hold up if the author is the biological mother. Emotionally, the author is in a tough spot, but did she act responsibly? She was in a long-distance relationship and didn't know about the marriage. She's making a choice about her own body, which is her right. The man's responsibility to support the child is a separate issue. The author's decision to keep the child might affect others, but she's not the one who broke the marriage or lied. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the author isn't in the wrong because the man's deceit is the main issue. Her choice about her pregnancy is her right, and the wife's threats are inappropriate. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
