I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the biological father and his wife wanting her to terminate.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was in a relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and his name. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the baby, but the father doesn't want to support the child, and his wife is threatening legal action.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent, deception, and the author's rights. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, which is a major issue. He also provided false information about age and name. That suggests he was deceptive from the start.\n\nThe husband's wife contacting the author and threatening legal action seems inappropriate. The author had no prior knowledge of the wife's existence, so she's caught in a situation she didn't ask for. The author is making her own choice about her pregnancy, which is a personal decision. The father's refusal to support the child is his choice, but the author isn't obligated to follow his wishes.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to make decisions about her own pregnancy. The wife's threats might not hold up in court because the author is not part of their marriage. The man's deceit is a key factor here. The author isn't at fault for the pregnancy resulting from a deceptive relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She was misled and is making her own choices based on her circumstances. The others' actions (husband's lies, wife's threats) are the issues, not the author's decision to continue the pregnancy.\n"
