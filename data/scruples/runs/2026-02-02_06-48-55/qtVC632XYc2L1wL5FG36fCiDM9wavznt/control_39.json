I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy despite the biological father's opposition and his wife's threats.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and other details. Now she's pregnant and the father wants her to terminate. His wife threatened legal action if she doesn't. The author is keeping the child and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, deception, and the author's autonomy. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, which is a significant ethical issue. The author didn't know he was married, so she wasn't intentionally having a relationship with a married man. The father's insistence on termination and the wife's threats complicate things. \n\nLegally, in most places, the pregnant person has the right to make decisions about their own body and pregnancy. The father's refusal to support the child doesn't legally override her autonomy. The wife's threats of legal action might be baseless or inappropriate, depending on jurisdiction, but that's separate from the author's responsibility.\n\nEthically, the man betrayed his wife and the author was deceived. The author isn't obligated to act according to the father's wishes, especially since he misrepresented his status. Her decision to continue the pregnancy is her own, and she hasn't acted wrongfully in this scenario. The threats from the wife are problematic, but the author isn't at fault for that either.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her autonomy over her body and the pregnancy is her right, and the father's deceit and the wife's threats don't place blame on her.\n"
