I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who is pregnant by a married man who lied to her about his relationship status and identity. The man is pressuring her to have an abortion, and his wife has threatened legal action against her for carrying the pregnancy to term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. The man was married and had children, but he misrepresented his relationship status to the woman. That's a significant deception. The woman now finds herself pregnant as a result of this deceit. The man is not willing to support the child, which adds to the woman's dilemma.\n\nThe wife's reaction, while aggressive, is understandable given that her husband has been unfaithful. However, her threatening legal action might not hold up legally because the woman had no part in the husband's infidelity. Legally, the wife might not have standing to demand a termination, and the woman's decision to continue the pregnancy is her right.\n\nEthically, the woman's choice to continue the pregnancy isn't inherently wrong because she was deceived. The man's actions were the initial wrong. The wife's threats are misplaced since the woman is not at fault. The woman is facing consequences not of her making but due to the man's deceitful actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author (the pregnant woman) isn't in the wrong. She was misled and is now dealing with the repercussions of someone else's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B for No.\n"
