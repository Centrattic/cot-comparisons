I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who is pregnant by a man who lied to her about being married and his true identity. The man and his wife are pressuring her to have an abortion, and she's considering moving forward with the pregnancy despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man was in a long-distance relationship with her but was actually married with kids, providing false information. That's a big betrayal. The woman is now pregnant and wants to keep the child. The husband insists on termination, and the wife contacts her with threats and anger. The author feels she's not in the wrong and is asking if she is.\n\nLegally, the wife's threats might be an issue, but the main question is the author's responsibility. She was deceived by the man, which complicates things. She didn't know he was married, so her decision to continue the pregnancy was made without that knowledge. However, some might argue that she should have been more cautious, but given the deception, that's not entirely fair. The husband's responsibility is also a factor here; he provided false information, which is his fault.\n\nEthically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The husband and wife's threats are problematic, especially since the wife isn't the biological parent. The author isn't at fault for the man's lies. Her decision to continue the pregnancy isn't her wrongdoing. The wrong here is primarily on the man for deceiving her and the wife for threatening her. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
