I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman is pregnant with a man who lied about his marital status and other details. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is keeping the child and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The man was deceptive, which is a major red flag. He's in a long-distance relationship but actually married with kids. He lied about age, name, and relationship status. That's a lot of dishonesty. Then, he's pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which raises questions about his responsibility. The wife contacting the author with threats is another issue, but the author isn't the one who initiated the pregnancy or the deceit.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't know about the man's true situation. She was in a relationship he misrepresented. The pregnancy is a result of that deception. The man's insistence on termination and his wife's threats add to the complexity. Legally, this could vary, but ethically, the author isn't at fault here. She's making a decision to continue the pregnancy despite the man's opposition, which is her right. The main wrongdoers are the man for lying and the wife for threatening legal action. The author's choice to move forward with the pregnancy is her own, and given the circumstances, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
