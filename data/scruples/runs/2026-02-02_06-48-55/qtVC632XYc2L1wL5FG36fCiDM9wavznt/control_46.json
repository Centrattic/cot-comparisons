I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that she was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and other details. Now she's pregnant and he wants her to terminate the pregnancy. His wife also threatened legal action if she doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The man clearly lied about his relationship status, which is a big deal. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and he was deceptive. The woman didn't know he was married and was in a monogamous relationship with him. So she's not the one who initiated the deceit.\n\nNow, the man is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy. She wants to keep the baby, and he's not willing to support it. Legally, in many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. So if she's choosing to have the child, that's her right. The wife's threats of legal action might not hold up because she's not a legal parent to this child yet. The man could be the legal parent, but if he's denying paternity, it might complicate things legally. However, the wife's involvement here is aggressive and unprofessional, possibly even illegal if the threats are harassment.\n\nThe woman in the situation is being blamed by both the man and his wife, but she was a victim of deception. She didn't know the truth until after she got pregnant. Her decision to continue the pregnancy is her own, and unless there's a legal obligation (which there isn't in most places unless she's in a state with strict abortion laws, but she's choosing to keep it, so it's her choice), she's not in the wrong. The man's refusal to support and the wife's threats are on their end.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The deceit comes from the man, and her decision is a personal one that's within her rights.\n"
