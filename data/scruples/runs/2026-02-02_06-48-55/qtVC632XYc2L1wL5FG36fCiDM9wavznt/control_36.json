I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lied about his relationship status, age, and name. He's pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife called her threateningly. The author is keeping the pregnancy and feels she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's at fault here. The man was married and lied about his relationship status, which is a big issue. He's also not willing to support the child, which adds to the problem. The wife's actions are aggressive, but she's not the focus here. The key points are deception from the man and the author's right to make decisions about her own pregnancy.\n\nLegally, in many places, a person has the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy, but this is complicated by the bio father's stance and the wife's threats. However, the author isn't the one who lied or caused the situation. The man's infidelity and lies are his responsibility. The author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice, especially since the father isn't supporting her. The wife's threats might be legally questionable, but the author isn't at fault for that either.\n\nEthically, the man's actions are definitely wrong for lying and being in a relationship while married. The author's decision to keep the child isn't something she can be blamed for, especially when the father is not supportive. Her right to autonomy over her body and future is a strong point. The wife's anger is directed at the husband's infidelity, not the author's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
