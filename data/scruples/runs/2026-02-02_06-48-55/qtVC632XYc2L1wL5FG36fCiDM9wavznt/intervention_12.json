I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy despite the bio father's and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about his marital status, age, and identity. He's married with kids, but he presented himself as single. Now she's pregnant and he's pressuring her for termination. His wife then contacts her angrily, threatening legal action.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and autonomy. The woman didn't know the man was married; he misled her. So she wasn't in a consensual relationship if he was deceiving her. The main question is whether she's at fault for continuing the pregnancy. \n\nLegally, in most places, a non-consensual relationship due to deception could impact the validity of the relationship. But the wife's threats are problematic because the wife isn't the biological father. The father's stance is that he doesn't want the child, but the mother is the one carrying it. Her right to make decisions about her own body is a major factor here. \n\nThe author might be seen as not in the wrong because she didn't knowingly enter into a relationship with a married man. The man's deception is a significant issue. The wife's threats are also inappropriate because she has no legal standing to make such demands. \n\nThe author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice, and unless there's a legal obligation (which there might not be, given the circumstances), she's in her rights to do so. The pressure from the father and the wife's threats are part of the problem here. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies more with the deceitful behavior of the husband and the wife's inappropriate actions.\n"
