I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got pregnant with a man who was already married and had lied about his status and other things. Now, the man wants an abortion, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author wants to keep the baby despite their objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body and pregnancy. So legally, she's probably within her rights to continue the pregnancy. The husband's wife threatening legal action might not have a strong basis because the author isn't legally bound to follow their wishes. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The man was deceptive, which is a major red flag. He lied about his relationship status and other details. The author wasn't in a consensual relationship if he was already married. So she might feel she was wronged first. But the question is whether she's in the wrong now for choosing to have the child. \n\nSome people might argue that she's complicating the lives of others, but others would say she's making the right choice for herself. Also, the wife's anger is understandable, but her threatening behavior is inappropriate. The author isn't responsible for the husband's infidelity. \n\nThe key points here are consent, deception, and autonomy. Since the author was misled, she's not at fault. Her decision to keep the baby is her personal choice. The other parties (the husband and wife) have their own issues, but the author isn't the one in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
