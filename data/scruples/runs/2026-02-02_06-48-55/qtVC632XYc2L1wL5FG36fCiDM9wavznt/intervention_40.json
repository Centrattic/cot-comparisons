I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for continuing the pregnancy despite the biological father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and identity. That's a big red flag. The man is married with children, so he's already in a committed relationship. The author now finds out she's pregnant. The biological father wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action if she doesn't.\n\nThe author is considering continuing the pregnancy. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the biological father is in a marriage, so his actions led to this situation. The wife's threats are also problematic, but the author is making a life-changing decision here. However, the author was in a relationship with a married man, which might imply some level of complicity. But wait, he lied about his status, so she might not have known. The legal aspect is tricky too\u2014since he's married, his wife might have legal claims depending on the jurisdiction. But the author's right to make decisions about her own body is a significant factor here. In many places, the mother has the right to decide about the pregnancy, especially if the father is not the legal guardian. The threats from the wife are concerning, but the author's decision to continue the pregnancy is her choice. The main issue here is whether the author is at fault for keeping the child. Since the father and his wife's actions are problematic (lying, threats), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a decision based on her circumstances. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
