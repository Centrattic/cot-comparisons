I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the bio father and his wife wanting her to terminate. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married and his age. Now she's pregnant and wants to keep the child, but the father doesn't want to support it, and his wife is threatening legal action. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and deception. The man lied about his relationship status and other details, so the author wasn't in a consensual relationship. That's a big red flag. The author didn't know she was involved with a married man, which complicates things. \n\nNow, the author's choice to continue the pregnancy: she's not the one who broke the trust or lied. The father's refusal to support the child and the wife's threats seem like their issues. The author is making a decision about her own body and future, which is generally her right. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that she should have known more about his situation. But since he was deceptive, she couldn't have. Also, her decision to carry the baby to term is personal and her choice. The others are reacting with threats, which is problematic. \n\nSo, considering the deception from the man and the threats from his wife, the author's decision seems justified. She's not in the wrong here. The main wrongdoers are the man and his wife for lying and threatening. The author is taking responsibility for her own life and child, which is her right.\n"
