I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving forward with the pregnancy despite the biological father and his wife's objections. \n\nFirst, the man lied about being married, his age, and his real name. That's a big deal. If someone lies about being in a committed relationship, that's a breach of trust. The author was in a long-distance relationship, thinking it was monogamous. The man's deception is a key point here.\n\nThen, the author is pregnant. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, but she's choosing to keep the child. The wife contacts the author, threatening legal action. The author is upset about the threats but stands by her decision.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author is at fault. The man's lies mean he's the one who misrepresented his relationship status. The author, in good faith, was in a relationship with someone who deceived her. Her decision to continue the pregnancy is her right, especially since she was misled. The wife's anger is directed at her husband's infidelity and the situation, but threatening legal action against the author is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she was the victim of someone else's deception. The man's actions led to this situation, so the responsibility isn't hers. The wife's threats are her issue, not the author's. The author has the autonomy to make decisions about her own pregnancy.\n"
