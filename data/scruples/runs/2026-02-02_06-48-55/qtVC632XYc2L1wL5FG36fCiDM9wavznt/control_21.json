I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe woman is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and lied to her about being in a monogamous relationship. He's not willing to support the child, and his wife threatened legal action if she didn't terminate the pregnancy. The woman wants to keep the baby despite his wishes.\n\nFirst, the man lied about his relationship status and other things. That's a huge red flag. He's married with children, so having a child with another woman is definitely wrong. The woman didn't know he was married, so she's not at fault for that. She trusted him, and he betrayed that trust.\n\nNow, the man wants her to terminate the pregnancy. But he's not willing to support the child. If he's the biological father, he might have legal responsibilities regardless of his marital status, but since he's married, there's also the wife involved. The wife threatening legal action because of her husband's affair and the pregnancy is another issue. She might feel her rights are being invaded, but threatening legal action is aggressive and possibly inappropriate.\n\nThe woman is deciding to keep the pregnancy. She's not doing anything illegal by carrying the baby to term. The man's arguments against supporting the child don't negate her right to make her own decision about the pregnancy. Even if he's not willing to support the child, that's his choice, but it doesn't mean the woman is wrong for proceeding. Plus, she's the one carrying the pregnancy, so her autonomy is key here.\n\nThe wife's threats are problematic. She shouldn't be making legal threats against someone who's not at fault. The woman didn't know about the marriage, so she's not responsible for the wife's anger.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own pregnancy unless there are specific circumstances that restrict that. Since the woman is the one carrying the child, her decision to keep it is her own. The man's refusal to support the child might be a separate issue if it comes to custody or support, but that's a different matter.\n\nEthically, the man's actions are questionable. He was deceitful, leading the woman to believe he was single. The wife's reaction is also extreme, but the woman isn't responsible for that. The woman isn't in the wrong here because she's making a decision based on her own circumstances and the deceit she was subjected to.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the woman isn't in the wrong. The man and his wife are the ones who acted improperly. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
