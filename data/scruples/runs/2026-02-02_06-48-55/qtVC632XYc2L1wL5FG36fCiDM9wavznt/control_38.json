I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to continue the pregnancy despite the bio father's and his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a man who was married and had children. He lied about his age and relationship status. That's definitely on him. He's the one who engaged in a deceitful relationship, right? So any responsibility here starts with him.\n\nNow, the author is pregnant and wants to keep the child. The bio father wants her to terminate because he doesn't want to support a child long-term. His wife contacts her threatening legal action. The author is upset about the threats but stands by her decision to keep the baby.\n\nThe key points here are: the father lied, the author was deceived, and now she's pregnant. Her decision to continue the pregnancy is her right. The wife's threats are inappropriate and possibly illegal. The author isn't the one who broke any laws here; the father did by having a relationship while married. The wife's reaction seems extreme, but the author isn't at fault here. She's making a choice about her own body and future. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
