I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who is pregnant with a man's child, but he's married and has lied to her about his age, name, and relationship status. The man wants her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife has threatened legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man deceived the woman by being dishonest about his marital status and other personal details. He's now pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The woman is choosing to continue the pregnancy despite their objections.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's at fault. The man's actions\u2014lying about his marriage, age, and identity\u2014are clearly unethical and possibly illegal if it's considered bigamy or fraud. The wife's threatening behavior is inappropriate and possibly illegal too, but the question is about the woman's actions.\n\nThe woman is making a personal decision about her body and pregnancy. Unless she did something illegal or unethical, like having the child knowing the man was married to spite them, she's not in the wrong. However, sometimes people might argue that she should have known more or that she's complicating an existing marriage. But given that the man lied, she couldn't have known. Also, she's the one being pressured and threatened, not making threats herself.\n\nIn most places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own pregnancy, even if the father objects. The threats from the wife are a separate issue. The woman isn't at fault for continuing the pregnancy. She's the victim of deception here. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
