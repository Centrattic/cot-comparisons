I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he\u2019s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. \n\nBut I\u2019m pregnant with his child.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author was in a long-distance relationship with a man who lied about being married, his age, and other details.\n2. She discovered he's married with children and that he's been deceptive.\n3. Despite his insistence, she decides to keep the pregnancy.\n4. His wife contacts her angrily, threatening legal action if she doesn't terminate the pregnancy.\n5. The author feels she did nothing wrong by choosing to continue the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the father's deceit. He lied about his marital status and other important details, which is a significant betrayal. The author didn't know he was married when they were in a relationship, so she wasn't intentionally engaging in an affair. The pregnancy is a result of this deceptive relationship.\n\nNow, the father is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, and his wife is threatening legal action. The author is standing by her decision to keep the baby. Legally, in many places, the mother has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy unless there are specific circumstances, but that's a separate issue. Ethically, the father's deceit plays a big role here. Since he lied, the author isn't at fault for continuing the pregnancy based on the information she had at the time.\n\nThe wife's anger is understandable, but threatening legal action over the termination decision might not be justified. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the father was deceptive, and the author made decisions based on that deception, she's not in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the man for lying. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
