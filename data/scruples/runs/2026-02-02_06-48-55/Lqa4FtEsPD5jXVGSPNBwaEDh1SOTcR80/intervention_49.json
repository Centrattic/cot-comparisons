Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is going on a two-week vacation, which has caused some backlash from their coworkers. The coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially, and they're upset that the author is taking time off when they're already short-staffed. The author works two jobs to afford the trip and hasn't seen their parents since moving, so they're going back for health reasons. Their manager approved the vacation, but coworkers are upset, even calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has saved up time off, which they are allowed to take. Management approved it, so from a company policy standpoint, they're following the rules. The coworkers are facing scheduling issues because of the author's absence. The author is using their earned time, which is their right. But the coworkers are in a different situation\u2014parents who might not have the same flexibility. The author's comment about the recital and the parent's partner attending seems dismissive, which could be part of the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and by company policy, they're not doing anything wrong. They have the right to use their PTO. However, socially and in terms of workplace relationships, maybe they came across as insensitive. The coworkers' problems are real, but the author isn't responsible for the staffing issues if management approved the time off. The author's response to the coworker about the recital might have been a poor choice in phrasing. But the act of taking vacation itself isn't wrong if it's approved. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance in how they handled the situation.\n"
