Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves taking a two-week vacation and facing backlash from coworkers.\n\nFirst, the author works two jobs to afford travel, which they can do because they're child-free. Their coworkers are single parents struggling financially. One coworker called them an asshole for taking two weeks off. The author plans this trip for four months, and their manager approved it. However, the team is now short-staffed, and coworkers are upset. The author responds to a coworker missing a recital by saying the kid will have more recitals and the husband can attend instead.\n\nI need to consider workplace dynamics. The author has the right to use their saved vacation time, and the manager approved it. However, taking two weeks might strain the team, especially if coworkers are already overburdened. The author's comment about the recital could come off as dismissive, which might justify some of the coworkers' frustration. But the author isn't responsible for how management handles staffing. \n\nIs it fair to criticize the author for using their earned time? They aren't at fault for management's staffing decisions. However, the dismissive comment about the recital shows a lack of empathy, which could be problematic. But the core issue is whether the vacation itself is wrong. Since it's approved and they have the time, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the tone of their response might contribute to the problem. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to take vacation as approved. But the way they handled the coworker's issue might be part of the problem. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the vacation, not their response. So probably B.\n"
