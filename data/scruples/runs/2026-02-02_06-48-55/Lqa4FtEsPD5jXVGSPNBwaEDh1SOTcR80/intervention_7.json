Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for taking two weeks of vacation. The situation is that the author works two jobs to afford travel, has no kids, and is going to Florida to see her parents who are having health issues. The coworkers are upset because they're parents struggling financially, and one coworker had to miss a kid's recital because the author is on vacation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's policies. The author mentions that the manager approved the vacation, so according to company rules, she's allowed to take the time. That's a key point because if it's approved, then the management is responsible for coverage, not the employee. The author says they planned this for four months, so she probably gave enough notice.\n\nNext, the coworkers are upset because they're single parents and struggling. The author's response about the kid's recital being a one-time event and that the father can attend might come off as dismissive. Even if the author's reasoning is valid, the way she responded could be seen as insensitive. However, the vacation itself isn't the issue; it's the impact on the team and the coworkers' stress.\n\nThe author is using her accrued vacation time, which is a legal right in many places. But the coworkers feel that management isn't handling staffing issues properly, and the author is making it worse by leaving. The author's attitude might contribute to a negative workplace environment. She's not wrong about management's responsibility, but the way she's handling the situation could be causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's following company policy and management approved it, then technically, she's not in the wrong. However, if her vacation is causing significant hardship for coworkers and she's being dismissive, it might be seen as insensitive. The answer depends on whether the focus is on company policy (her right to take time off) versus workplace dynamics (the impact on colleagues).\n"
