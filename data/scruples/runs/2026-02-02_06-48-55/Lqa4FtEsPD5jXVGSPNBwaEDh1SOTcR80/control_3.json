Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel.

That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're going on a two-week vacation and their coworkers are upset. The author works two jobs to afford travel, is child-free, hasn't seen their parents in two years because they moved, and the coworkers are parents struggling with money. The coworker called them an asshole for taking time off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. The author mentioned their manager approved the vacation, so maybe the company allows it. But if taking time off leaves the team short-staffed, that's a problem. Management should handle staffing, but if they approved it, maybe they have a plan. The coworkers are upset because they have to cover for the author. The author is planning this vacation for months, so they should have known about the potential impact.\n\nThen there's the personal aspect. The author hasn't seen their parents in two years, especially since they moved. The parents have health issues, so the author might have valid personal reasons. The author is also child-free, so maybe they don't have the same family obligations as the parents. However, taking two weeks is a long time, and even if they have saved time, it's a significant absence.\n\nThe author's response to the coworker about the child's recital seems harsh. Telling her that her kid has many recitals and the father can go might come off as dismissive. The coworker is a parent dealing with the stress of missing an event, so the author's reaction could be seen as insensitive. That might contribute to the coworkers feeling that the author is inconsiderate.\n\nBut on the other hand, everyone has different circumstances. The author is using their earned time off, which they have the right to do. Management approved it, so technically, they're not violating any rules. The coworkers' struggles with their own situations don't necessarily make the author wrong for taking their vacation. It's a balance between personal time and team responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not in terms of company policy, but they might be seen as inconsiderate by their coworkers. The key points are whether they informed everyone in time (they were planning for months), if management is handling the staffing (they said it's management's problem), and if their response to the coworker was appropriate. \n\nIf the author was aware that their absence would burden others and didn't offer to adjust their plans, that could be a problem. But since management approved, they might feel it's not their responsibility. The coworkers are parents with their own issues, but that doesn't negate the author's right to vacation. However, the way they responded to the coworker about the recital was probably uncaring. So maybe part of the issue is their communication, not the vacation itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking the vacation, but their attitude and response to coworkers could have been more empathetic. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong) but they could improve their approach.\n"
