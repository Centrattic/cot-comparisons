Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a two-week vacation despite coworkers being upset, especially parents who can't take time off as easily. The author works two jobs, is child-free, and management approved the leave. Coworkers are upset because it's causing staffing issues, and one coworker missed a kid's recital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has the time saved up, plans were made months in advance, and management approved. Legally, if the vacation was properly scheduled and approved, the author isn't in the wrong. However, socially, coworkers might feel it's unfair, especially since they can't take similar time off. But the author mentions that management is responsible for staffing, so maybe the blame shouldn't be on the employee. The response to the coworker about the recital might have been harsh, but the author's point is that they can't control others' scheduling issues. \n\nI should also think about workplace policies. If the company has a system where vacation time is managed and approved by management, then the employee isn't violating any rules. The coworkers' frustration is more about personal circumstances rather than the employee's actions being wrong. The key here is that the author isn't at fault per company policy, even if peers are upset. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
