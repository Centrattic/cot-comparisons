Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking a two-week vacation when coworkers are upset. The author works two jobs to afford the trip and hasn't seen their parents since moving. The coworker called them an asshole for taking time off, and the author responded by saying the coworker's kid can miss a recital because there will be more in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a right to use their vacation time, especially since it's approved by management. The fact that they have saved time off and planned for four months suggests they tried to manage their time responsibly. The author is also not a parent, so maybe they don't fully understand the coworkers' stress about being single parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers are struggling with work-life balance, especially since they have children. If the author's vacation is causing understaffing, it might be adding pressure on others. The author's response about the recital seems dismissive and could come off as insensitive, even if they didn't mean to. Management approved the time off, but maybe they should have considered the team's workload better.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, taking vacation is generally a right, but how they handle it matters. The author might not be in the wrong for taking the time off, but their response to the coworker's situation could be seen as lacking empathy. However, the coworker's reaction of calling them an asshole is also harsh. The key points are: management approved it, the author planned ahead, but the team is understaffed and coworkers are stressed. The author's comment about the recital might have been inappropriate. It's a gray area. If the author had communicated better or considered the team's situation more, maybe the outcome would be different. But since management approved it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) but with some caveats about their response to coworkers.\n"
