Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is presented as \"AITA for going on vacation?\" with coworkers saying they are. The author works two jobs to afford travel, is child-free, and coworkers are parents struggling. \n\nThe coworker called the author an asshole for taking two weeks off. The author hasn't seen their parents in two years, who have health issues and can't visit. They have saved time off to take the vacation, planned for four months, and management approved it. However, the team is short-staffed because of this, and coworkers are upset, especially one whose kid's recital they missed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. The author has a right to use their vacation time, which is planned and approved by management. Taking time off to see family, especially when they can't visit, is understandable. However, the author's comment about the coworker's kid having many recitals and the father going instead seems insensitive. That could be a point where the author overstepped, especially if the coworker is already stressed about work coverage.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is wrong to take the vacation. Legally and ethically, if the time is accrued and management approved it, then the author isn't wrong. The coworkers' frustration is about staffing, which is management's responsibility, not the author's. However, the author's dismissive comment might have hurt feelings. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for taking the vacation but perhaps could have handled the situation more empathetically. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong regarding the vacation itself. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
