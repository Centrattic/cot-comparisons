Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, and coworkers are upset about it. The author works two jobs to afford travel, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. The coworkers are parents, some single, struggling financially. The author got called an asshole for taking the vacation, and one coworker had to miss a kid's recital because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has the right to use accrued vacation time. Management approved it, so maybe the team's staffing issues are management's responsibility. But the coworkers are dealing with the consequences, like missing a recital. The author's comment about the kid's recitals being numerous and suggesting the coworker's father go might come off as dismissive. Even if the author is using their saved time, it's possible that the team is already stretched thin, especially with parents needing time for family events. The author might be in the right in terms of their right to take time off, but the way they responded to the coworker's situation could be seen as insensitive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I have to decide. The answer depends on whether taking the vacation and the response to the coworker's situation is appropriate. The author's argument is that they planned ahead and have the time saved, but coworkers are left in a tough spot. Since the manager approved, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the comment about the recital is probably where the AITA comes from. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because of the insensitive response, even if their vacation is justified. Alternatively, if the manager approved and it's not their fault the team is short, then not in the wrong (B). Hmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the answer isn't clear. I'll go with A (Yes) because the comment about the coworker's kid's recital was harsh and dismissive, even if the vacation itself isn't. The way they handled the situation and their response could have been more empathetic.\n"
