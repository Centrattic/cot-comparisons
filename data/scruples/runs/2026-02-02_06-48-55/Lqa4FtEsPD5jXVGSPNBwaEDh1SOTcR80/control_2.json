Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're going on a two-week vacation, and their coworkers are upset about it. The author works two jobs to afford traveling and hasn't seen their parents since moving. Their coworker called them an asshole for taking the time off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the author has saved up vacation time and it's approved by management, then technically they're following the rules. Management's approval is important here because if they didn't have a problem with the schedule, maybe the team should handle staffing issues themselves. \n\nBut the coworkers are all parents or single parents who are already struggling. The author's vacation might make the team short-staffed. Even if it's not the author's problem, causing additional stress on coworkers could make people feel like the author is being selfish. The author dismisses the coworker's situation by saying the kid will have more recitals and the father can go, which might come off as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to use their accrued vacation time. The fact that they work two jobs to support this might add context. They also mention they haven't seen their parents in a while, which is a personal need. But the way they responded to the coworker might not help their case. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be in the wrong if their vacation time is causing undue hardship on others, especially if management didn't foresee this issue. However, if the vacation was properly planned and approved, maybe not. The key points are the insensitivity in their response and the impact on coworkers. But since management approved it, maybe the author isn't at fault. I think it's a balance between personal time and teamwork. The author's response to the coworker's problem was harsh, which could make them seem uncaring, so maybe they are partly in the wrong. But the vacation itself, if approved, isn't their fault. It's a bit of both, but leaning towards B because they followed company policy, even if their response was tactless.\n"
