Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether taking two weeks of vacation, despite coworkers' complaints, is justified.\n\nFirst, the poster works two jobs to afford travel, which gives them the financial means. They mention their coworkers are single parents struggling, so maybe there's a perception that the poster is selfish. But the poster is using saved time off, which they've been planning for four months. Management approved it, so technically it's allowed.\n\nThe coworker called them an asshole because they're taking time off, and others are upset about being short-staffed. The poster responds by dismissing a coworker's concern about a kid's recital, saying the kid will have more and the father can go. That reaction might come off as harsh, even if the poster's point is valid (recitals happen often). \n\nThe key points here: The poster has the right to use their PTO as approved. However, the way they responded to coworkers could be seen as insensitive. The coworkers are facing real stress, especially parents dealing with childcare and financial issues. The poster's dismissal of their situation might be where they're in the wrong, not the vacation itself. But the vacation is a personal right, and management's approval covers the team's ability to handle the absence. \n\nSo, considering both the action (taking vacation) and the reaction (snarky response), the poster isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking time off, but the way they handled the coworkers' concerns could be problematic. The main issue is whether the vacation is justified, but since it's approved, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the tone and response to coworkers might tip the scale. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the vacation itself is wrong, which it's not. So answer B.\n"
