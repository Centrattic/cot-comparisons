Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel.

I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves taking a two-week vacation and facing backlash from coworkers and a coworker calling them an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has two jobs, is child-free, and can afford to take time off. They've been planning the vacation for four months, and their manager has approved it. The coworkers are mostly single parents struggling to make ends meet, and they're upset because the vacation is causing staffing issues. The author responded to a coworker's complaint by saying that her kid's recital isn't a big deal and that her husband can attend instead.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for taking the vacation? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to use their accrued vacation time. Their manager approved it, which means management is aware and responsible for coverage. The coworker's criticism, especially the personal attack, seems inappropriate. The author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to that criticism. The author isn't responsible for staffing issues; that's management's job. The fact that they've been planning this for months suggests they tried to schedule it without disrupting work.\n\nOn the other hand, coworkers are facing real difficulties. The author's vacation is causing them to miss events like a kid's recital. The author's comment about the recital might come off as dismissive and uncaring, even if the coworker's husband can attend. The author's attitude of \"it's not my problem\" could be seen as insensitive, even if they're technically in the right about the vacation.\n\nBut legally and by company policy, if the vacation is approved, the author isn't at fault. The coworkers' reactions might stem from their own stress and not the actual fault of the author. The author's response to the coworker was harsh, but the coworker called them an asshole first. The author has a right to defend themselves.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, employees should respect each other's time off. The author isn't to blame for management not covering shifts. The coworkers need to address the issue with management, not the employee. The author's actions are within their rights, even if the coworkers feel it's unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The vacation was approved, and the author isn't responsible for staffing issues. The coworkers' reactions are their own stress and not the author's fault. The author's response was a defense against unwarranted criticism, and they have the right to use their vacation time.\n"
