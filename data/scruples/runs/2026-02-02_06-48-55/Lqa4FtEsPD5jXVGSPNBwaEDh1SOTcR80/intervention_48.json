Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, given that coworkers are upset. The author works two jobs, is child-free, and hasn't seen family in a while. The coworkers are parents struggling financially. The author's manager approved the vacation, but the coworkers are blaming them for being short-staffed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has saved up time off, which they're allowed to use. They mentioned that management approved it, so maybe the scheduling issue is on management's shoulders. However, the coworkers are upset because they have to cover the extra work, especially with one missing a kid's recital. The author's response to the coworker about the recital might come off as dismissive, which could be a problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to use their vacation time, especially if it's approved and they've planned ahead. It's common to take time off for family reasons, and not seeing parents due to health issues is valid. On the other hand, the coworkers are in a tough spot, and the author's vacation is causing added stress. The response about the recital could be seen as insensitive, even if the author's intention was to point out that the coworker's child will have more recitals. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the author didn't know about the coworker's specific situation (the recital), maybe they shouldn't have dismissed it. However, coworkers can have different perspectives. Since the manager approved it, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the way they responded might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether taking vacation is their right versus how they handled the coworkers' concerns. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking the vacation, but their dismissive comment might have made things worse. But the main question is if they're in the wrong for taking the vacation itself. Since the manager approved it and they've planned ahead, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but their comment could be a separate issue. However, the question is about the vacation, not their response. So maybe B is the answer here. But some might argue that even with approval, the team's workload is an issue. It's a bit of a grey area. I'm leaning towards B because the vacation is approved, but the response was poor. The main issue is whether the vacation is a problem. Since the author has the right to use their time, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
