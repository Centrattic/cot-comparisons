Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation. The person mentions they work two jobs, are child-free, and haven't seen their parents in two years because they moved. The coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially. One coworker called them an asshole for taking time off, and others are upset about being short-staffed. The manager approved the leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned the vacation four months in advance and got management approval. That's important because if management approved it, maybe they managed the staffing accordingly. However, the coworkers are feeling stressed because they have to cover more work, especially one missing a kid's recital. The author responded by saying the coworker's kid has many recitals and the spouse can go instead. That response might be seen as dismissive of the coworker's personal situation.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and professionally, if they have taken proper steps and management approved, they might not be at fault. But ethically, maybe they should consider their coworkers' situations more. The coworkers are in a different situation\u2014parents with financial struggles. The author's response about the recital seems harsh. Even if the author has a valid reason, how they communicate matters. Maybe the author didn't consider the team's perspective enough. However, using vacation time is a basic right, and management's approval suggests it's reasonable. The coworkers' issues might be more about management's workload management than the author's vacation. So the answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that their communication could be better. But the question is strictly whether they're in the wrong. Since they followed proper procedures, maybe they aren't. The coworkers' frustration is valid, but the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
