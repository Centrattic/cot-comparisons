Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for taking a two-week vacation, given the coworkers' reactions. The author works two jobs, has no kids, and is using saved time off to visit parents in Florida. The coworkers are parents struggling financially and feel the author is being selfish by leaving, causing staff shortages. The manager approved the vacation, but the coworker called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has the right to use their PTO as they see fit, especially if it's pre-approved. Legally, they aren't in the wrong because they've followed company policy. However, the social dynamics are more complex. The coworkers are dealing with their own stress from being single parents and financial struggles, so the author's vacation might be a sore spot. \n\nThe author's response about the recital\u2014saying the kid will have more recitals and the father can attend\u2014might come off as dismissive. Even if the author's statement is logically correct, the tone could be seen as insensitive. The coworkers are under pressure, and the author's vacation is adding to their workload, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe author mentions they've been planning this for four months, so they had time to consider the impact. While it's their right to take time off, the way they handle the coworkers' concerns (defensive, maybe condescending) could make others feel disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using their own earned time and isn't violating any rules. The management approved it, so the company isn't against it. The coworker's reaction might be based on personal stress rather than the author's fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix of personal responsibility and workplace empathy. The author isn't legally or ethically wrong for taking the vacation, but their response to coworkers might have been inconsiderate. However, the core issue is about their right to use PTO, which is protected. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their communication could be improved.\n"
