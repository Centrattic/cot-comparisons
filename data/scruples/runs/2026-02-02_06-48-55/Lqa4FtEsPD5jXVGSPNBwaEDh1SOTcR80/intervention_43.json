Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author takes two weeks off for vacation, and their coworkers are upset. The coworkers are parents dealing with their own struggles, and the author is seen as not considering their team's difficulties.\n\nFirst, the author works two jobs, which suggests they have some financial stability or flexibility. They mention being child-free, so maybe they don't have the same family obligations as their coworkers. The coworkers, on the other hand, are single parents or have kids, which can be a lot to manage. The author's vacation is causing the team to be short-staffed, which is a problem the coworkers are facing. \n\nThe coworker who called the author an asshole is probably frustrated because they have to cover more work or miss events like their kid's recital. The author's response about the kid having hundreds of recitals and suggesting the father can attend might come off as dismissive. That could be seen as insensitive, even if the author's intention was to highlight that the coworker's problem isn't unique. \n\nManagement approved the vacation, so technically the author followed the proper channels. But just because it's approved doesn't mean there's no impact on the team. The author might not be in the wrong legally or by company policy, but socially or morally, they might be seen as not considering their coworkers' situations. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that management should handle staffing, which is true, but maybe they didn't consider communicating better with the team or offering to help mitigate the situation. Taking two weeks off is within their rights, but the way they react to coworkers' concerns might make them appear indifferent. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author has the right to take vacation, but the social dynamics and their response to coworkers' issues could be problematic. Whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether we prioritize following company policy versus considering team dynamics and empathy towards coworkers' challenges.\n"
