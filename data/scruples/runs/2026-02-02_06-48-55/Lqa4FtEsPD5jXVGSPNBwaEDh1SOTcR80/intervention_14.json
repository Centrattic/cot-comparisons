Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, especially since their coworkers are upset. The author works two jobs, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents in Florida since moving. They have saved up time off, and their manager approved it. The coworkers are parents struggling, and the author was called an asshole for taking the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a right to use their accrued vacation time. Management approved it, so maybe they're handling the staffing. The coworkers are facing hardship, but the author's actions might be impacting them. The author's response about the recital seems dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive. But the author's reason for going to see parents with health issues adds context.\n\nIs it about the right to take vacation vs. the impact on others? Legally and according to company policy, if it's approved, the author isn't in the wrong. However, socially, maybe they could have been more considerate, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about being a good coworker. The author's reasoning that management handles staffing is valid. So, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue they should have been more empathetic. However, the original question is about being in the wrong, not just morally wrong. Since the author followed company procedures, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
