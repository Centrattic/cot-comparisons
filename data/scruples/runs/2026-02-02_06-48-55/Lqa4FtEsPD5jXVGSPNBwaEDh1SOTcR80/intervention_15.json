Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel.

I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation. The situation is that the author works two jobs and can afford to travel because they're child-free. Their coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially. One coworker called them an asshole for taking the time off. The author hasn't seen their parents in Florida since moving, and the parents can't visit due to health issues. The author has saved up the time off and planned it for four months. Management approved it, but the team is short-staffed. Another coworker had to miss a kid's recital because of this, and the author responded by saying the kid will have many recitals and the spouse can go instead.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about taking time off that's been approved by management. The author has planned this for a while and has the time saved. But the coworkers are upset because they're dealing with the workload and personal issues. The author's response to the coworker about the recital was a bit harsh, maybe. \n\nLegally, if the time off was approved, the author isn't in the wrong. But socially, maybe they are causing strain on the team. The author's comment about the recital might have been dismissive of the coworker's situation. However, the author is also trying to see their aging parents, which is a valid reason. The coworkers are in a different life situation, so there's a clash of priorities. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for taking the vacation if it's approved, but maybe they could have been more empathetic in their response to the coworker's problem. The main question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they followed the proper channels (manager approved), technically they're not in the wrong. But the social aspect is a gray area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the company approved it, but there's a nuance in how they handled the coworker's issue. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe they need to consider both perspectives.\n"
