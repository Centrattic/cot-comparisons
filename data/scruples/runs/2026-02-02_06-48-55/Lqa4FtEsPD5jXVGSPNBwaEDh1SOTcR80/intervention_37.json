Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a two-week vacation and being criticized by coworkers.\n\nFirst, the author has two jobs, is child-free, and uses that to travel. The coworkers are parents struggling to make ends meet. One coworker called them an asshole for taking time off. The author says they've saved time off, planned for four months, and their manager approved it. However, the team is short-staffed because of this, and coworkers are upset, even comparing the author's vacation to missing a kid's recital.\n\nHmm, the author's points are that they have the right to use their saved time, management approved, and it's not their problem if the team is short. But the coworkers are in a tough spot, especially when one has to miss a kid's recital. The author's response about the kid having hundreds of recitals and the father going instead might come off as dismissive. \n\nI need to consider company policies. If the author followed proper procedures and got approval, then they're within their rights. However, the impact on the team is significant. If the team is understaffed, maybe the author didn't consider how their absence affects others. But they did plan ahead. \n\nThe coworkers' frustration isn't about the vacation itself but the added stress. The author's response to the coworker about the recital was probably harsh. Even if the author has a right to take the time, the way they responded might have made things worse. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not in taking the vacation since it's approved, but their attitude and dismissiveness towards coworkers' concerns could make them seem inconsiderate. However, legally or by company policy, they aren't at fault. But socially, they might be. The question is about whether they're in the wrong, which is subjective. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide if it's A or B. Considering the manager approved and the author planned ahead, technically they're not in the wrong. However, the way they handled the coworker's complaint might be an issue. But the question is whether the vacation itself is wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they followed procedures, but their response to coworkers was poor. The main question is about the vacation, not their reaction. So technically, they're not in the wrong. But maybe the coworkers have a valid concern about being understaffed. But it's management's responsibility to handle staffing. So the author isn't at fault.\n"
