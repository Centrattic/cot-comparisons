Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation is about taking two weeks of vacation, which coworkers are upset about.\n\nFirst, the person has two jobs and is child-free, which allows them to travel. Their coworkers are parents or single parents with financial struggles. One coworker called them an asshole for taking the vacation. The author's parents are in Florida and having health issues, so the trip is to see them. They've saved up time off and planned for months. The manager approved the leave, but the team is short-staffed because of it. The author told a coworker that missing a kid's recital isn't a big deal since there are many more, and the kid's other parent can attend.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. On one hand, taking a vacation is a personal right, especially if it's approved by management. The author has the time saved and a valid reason to visit parents. Management's approval suggests they handle staffing. However, the coworkers are struggling, and the author's vacation does add pressure on them. The author's response about the recital was dismissive, which might be seen as insensitive, even if the reasoning is logical.\n\nThe key points: The vacation is approved, so maybe management is handling coverage. But the coworkers' stress is valid. The author's comment about the recital could be harsh. However, the trip is to see parents with health issues, which is a personal matter. The author isn't responsible for the team's staffing issues, as that's management's role. The coworkers being upset is understandable, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they followed company policy. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have a right to use their PTO as they see fit, and the manager approved it. The coworkers' issues are their own to resolve with management, not the author's fault.\n"
