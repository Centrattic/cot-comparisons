Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for taking two weeks of vacation. The situation involves coworkers who are parents and struggling financially, and the author has two jobs to afford travel. The coworkers are upset, especially one who has to miss a kid's recital because of the author's absence. The author's manager has approved the time off.\n\nFirst, the right to take vacation: Generally, employees have the right to use their accrued vacation days, especially if it's approved by management. The author has been planning this for four months, so they should have given enough notice. However, the team is short-staffed. The company's management is responsible for scheduling and coverage. If management approved the time off, they should have arranged for coverage. The author isn't responsible for the team's staffing issues unless they were aware of the potential problem and ignored it. \n\nThe author's response to the coworker about the recital might come off as dismissive. Saying \"her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place\" could be seen as insensitive. Even though the author is child-free and might not understand the importance, the response lacks empathy. \n\nBut the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, if the vacation was properly requested and approved, the author isn't at fault. The coworkers' frustration is about their own situations, but that doesn't make the author wrong for taking their own time. However, the author could have been more considerate in their communication, especially regarding the coworker's personal situation. \n\nThe key factors here are management approval and prior notice. Since the manager approved it, the burden is on them to manage the team's workload. The author isn't in the wrong for taking approved time off, but their dismissive comment might be a point of criticism.\n"
