Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves taking a two-week vacation, which coworkers disapprove of, especially since they are single parents struggling. The author works two jobs and has saved up time off. They're going to see their parents in Florida who are having health issues. The coworkers are upset because the team is short-staffed, and one coworker missed a kid's recital because of this. The manager approved the time off, but coworkers are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author has the right to use their accrued vacation time, as per company policy. Management approved it, so from a procedural standpoint, the author isn't violating any rules. However, the coworkers are facing hardships, particularly parents who can't get time off for their children's events. The author's response to the coworker about the recital seems dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive. They imply that the coworker's child's recital isn't that important and that the spouse can attend instead. That's probably where the conflict arises.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they have the right to take vacation. On the other hand, their vacation is causing their coworkers stress and hardship. The author's justification is that they're using saved time and that management is handling staffing. But the coworkers are in a different situation\u2014single parents with financial struggles. The author's comment about the recital being one of many and the spouse's ability to attend might come off as not empathizing with the coworker's situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for taking approved vacation, but their lack of empathy and the way they handled the coworker's concern about the recital could be problematic. The key points are the right to vacation vs. the impact on others and the tone of their response. So while the vacation itself isn't wrong, the way they addressed the coworker's issue might be. However, the main question is about being in the wrong overall. Since the company approved the time off, the author isn't in the wrong for taking it, but perhaps their approach in handling the coworkers' concerns was inappropriate. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to take the vacation, even if the coworkers are upset. The main issue is the response to the coworker, but the vacation itself isn't wrong. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
