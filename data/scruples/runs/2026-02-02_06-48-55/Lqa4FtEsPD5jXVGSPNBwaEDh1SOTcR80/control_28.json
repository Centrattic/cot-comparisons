Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves taking a two-week vacation, which coworkers are upset about. The key points here are the author's right to use their saved vacation time, the manager's approval, and the coworkers' personal circumstances.\n\nFirst, the author works two jobs and is child-free, allowing them to save vacation time. They have a valid reason to visit their parents, especially since the parents are experiencing health issues and can't come to them. The manager approved the time off, so management isn't an issue here. The coworkers are all parents with financial struggles and are being affected by the author's absence. \n\nBut legally and ethically, employees have the right to use their accrued vacation time as they see fit. The fact that the author planned this 4 months in advance shows they tried to minimize disruption. The coworker missing a recital is a personal issue, but the author's response about another parent attending might be harsh, but not necessarily wrong. The author shouldn't be responsible for others' scheduling conflicts, especially if they've already communicated and got management's go-ahead. \n\nHowever, the coworkers feel ganged up on, which might indicate a lack of consideration in the workplace environment. But the author isn't at fault for taking legal, approved leave. Management should handle staffing issues, not individual employees. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
