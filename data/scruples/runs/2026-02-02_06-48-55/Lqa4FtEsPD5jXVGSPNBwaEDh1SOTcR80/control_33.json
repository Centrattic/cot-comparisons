Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, especially since their coworkers are upset about it. The author has two jobs and is child-free, allowing them to travel, while their coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially. The main conflict is about whether taking vacation time is selfish, especially when it causes staffing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's policies. The author mentions their manager approved the vacation, so from a procedural standpoint, they followed the right steps. Management's approval is key here because it means the company is aware and okay with the time off. If the team is short-staffed, that's a management issue, not the employee's. The coworker's frustration might stem from their own stress, but that doesn't make the author wrong for taking their legally entitled time off.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning for taking the vacation is personal. They haven't seen their parents in two years due to relocation, and the parents have health issues. The author is using saved time, which they have earned. It's reasonable to use vacation time for personal needs, especially family-related reasons. The author's response to the coworker about the recital is a bit harsh, but it's a reaction to criticism, and it's valid to prioritize one's own needs sometimes.\n\nHowever, the author's comment about the coworker's child having \"hundreds of recitals\" might come off as dismissive. While the author has a point that other family members can attend, the way it's phrased can seem insensitive. That might contribute to the coworkers feeling ganged up on. But the core issue is about the vacation itself. \n\nThe coworkers' frustration could be due to their own stressors, which they're projecting onto the author. The author isn't responsible for the team's staffing; that's management's job. If the team is short-staffed, it's a management oversight. The author isn't at fault for taking pre-approved time off. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed company procedures, have earned their vacation time, and have legitimate personal reasons for taking it. The coworkers' issues are more about their own situations than the author's actions. The author's response to the coworker was perhaps blunt, but the vacation itself is justified.\n"
