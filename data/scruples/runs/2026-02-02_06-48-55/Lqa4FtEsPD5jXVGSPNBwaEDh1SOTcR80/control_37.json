Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the person works two jobs, is child-free, and uses saved time off to visit family in Florida. Their coworkers are parents struggling financially and are upset about being short-staffed. The author's manager approved the vacation, but coworkers are upset, especially when one had to miss a kid's recital because they had to cover shifts.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they planned the trip months in advance, and the manager is okay with it. They argue that management should handle staffing issues, and they\u2019re not responsible for the team's problems. They also point out that the coworker's child will have many recitals, and the parent could attend instead.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Taking a pre-approved vacation is generally their right. They saved the time, so it's not like they're stealing PTO. However, the impact on the team is a factor. If the team is consistently understaffed, maybe the author should consider the team's well-being. But the manager approved it, so maybe that's management's job. \n\nThe author's response to the coworker about the recital seems a bit harsh. Telling someone their child's recital isn't that important and suggesting the parent can go instead could be insensitive. Even if the author's point is valid (there will be more recitals), the way they said it might come off as dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using their own earned time, and it's their choice. The coworkers' judgment might be because they can't do the same due to family responsibilities. The author isn't in the wrong for taking the vacation, but their response to the coworker might have been handled better. The main question is whether they're in the wrong for the vacation itself. Since the manager approved it and the author planned it in advance, they're not in the wrong. The coworkers' frustration is more about their own situations, not the author's actions. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
