Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is planning a two-week vacation, which coworkers are upset about because they're struggling with work-life balance, especially as parents. The author works two jobs to afford travel and hasn't seen family in two years. The coworkers are upset, one even called them an asshole, and the author responded by saying a coworker's child can have other people at recitals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has saved time off and is using it, which is their right. They mentioned that management approved the leave, so it's not a violation of company policy. However, the coworkers are dealing with their own stress, being parents and struggling financially. The author's response to the coworker about the recital might have come off as dismissive. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, probably because the response was harsh. But the author has a valid point about management responsibility for staffing. The coworkers are projecting their own situations onto the author. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice their time, but maybe the way they responded could be improved. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The vacation is approved, and leaving is their right. The coworkers' reactions are more about their own stress. The author's comment about the recital was a bit insensitive, but maybe justified as a response to being criticized. It's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is the coworkers' frustration, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for taking approved leave. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong), but maybe with some nuance.\n"
