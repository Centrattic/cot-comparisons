Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, given the circumstances they described. The author works two jobs, has no kids, and is going to Florida to visit parents who are having health issues. They\u2019ve saved up time off and the manager approved it. However, coworkers are upset because they\u2019re parents struggling to manage, and one coworker had to miss a kid's recital because of the author's absence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason to visit parents with health issues, and the vacation was approved by management. They also have the time saved up. On the other hand, the coworkers are dealing with family responsibilities and the team is short-staffed, which might affect their ability to handle work. \n\nThe author's response to the coworker about missing a recital was a bit harsh, though. Telling someone their kid will have many recitals and suggesting the father can go instead might come off as dismissive of their personal situation. That could have been a poor choice in words, but maybe the author felt they were being unfairly criticized.\n\nThe key points here are: the vacation was planned ahead, approved by management, and the author has the right to use their accrued time. However, the team being short-staffed is a valid concern from the coworkers. But if management approved it, maybe they have a plan to cover the workload. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not. They have a right to take their vacation, especially for family health reasons. However, the way they responded to the coworker might have been inconsiderate. But the main issue is whether taking the vacation is wrong. The author's actions are within their rights, so they might not be in the wrong. But the coworkers' stress is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). They have a valid reason, management approved it, and while the coworkers are struggling, that's a management issue to handle staffing. The author isn't responsible for that.\n"
