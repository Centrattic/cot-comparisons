Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole for taking a two-week vacation. They have two jobs, are child-free, and their coworkers are mostly parents or single parents who are struggling. A coworker called them an asshole for taking the vacation, and others are upset. The author hasn't seen their parents since moving two years ago because their parents won't visit and are having health issues. They have saved up time off and planned this for four months. The manager approved it, but the team is short-staffed because of it. One coworker has to miss a kid's recital, and the author told them that their kid will have many recitals and the father can go instead.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for taking the vacation: seeing their parents who are having health issues and haven't visited since moving. They\u2019ve saved up the time, which they\u2019re allowed to do, and the manager approved it. The coworkers are in a different situation, being parents and struggling financially. The author\u2019s response to the coworker about the recital might have been harsh, but the comment about the father going instead is a valid point\u2014parents often split responsibilities.\n\nHowever, leaving the team short-staffed could be an issue. Even if the manager approved, maybe the author could have considered how their absence affects others. But they mention that management is responsible for staffing issues. The coworkers' frustration might stem from their own stress and not the author's actions directly. The author isn't at fault for taking approved time off, but their response to the coworker might have been insensitive. However, the overall situation seems like the author isn't in the wrong. The coworkers are struggling, but that doesn't justify the author not taking their vacation. The answer is likely B.\n"
