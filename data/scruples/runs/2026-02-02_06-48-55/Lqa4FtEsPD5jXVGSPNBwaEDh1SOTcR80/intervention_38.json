Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is going on a vacation for two weeks, and their coworkers are upset because they're parents and struggling with work-life balance. The author works two jobs to afford the trip, hasn't seen their parents in Florida since moving, and management has approved the time off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to take vacation time, especially if it's approved by management. Using saved time off is a personal choice. However, the coworkers are parents who might already be stretched thin, and the author's absence is causing them to be short-staffed. The coworker mentioned missing a child's recital, which is a significant event for a parent.\n\nThe author's response to the coworker about the recital being replaced by the father might come off as dismissive. While the author has a right to vacation, being considerate of how one's absence affects others is important. Management's approval doesn't absolve the author of potential insensitivity. The key here is whether the author should have considered the team's workload and communicated better, even if management said it's okay. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons\u2014personal time, family health issues, and planning ahead. It's a balance between personal rights and workplace empathy. Since the coworkers are already in a tough spot and the author's vacation adds to their stress without showing empathy, it might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong. So, maybe answer A.\n"
