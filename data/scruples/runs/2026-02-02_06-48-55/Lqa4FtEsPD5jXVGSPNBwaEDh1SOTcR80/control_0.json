Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking a two-week vacation and coworkers being upset about it. The writer mentions they work two jobs, are child-free, and the coworkers are parents struggling financially. The main points are: coworkers called them an asshole, the manager approved the vacation, and the team is short-staffed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The vacation was planned four months in advance, and the manager approved it. That suggests the management is okay with the time off, so maybe the employer handles scheduling. But coworkers are upset because they're already stressed and perhaps the team is understaffed. The writer's response to the coworker about missing a recital was dismissive, which might have added to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer depends on several factors. Legally, if the vacation was approved, the writer isn't in the wrong. However, from a workplace etiquette perspective, if taking the vacation causes hardship for coworkers, especially if management didn't address the coverage properly, there might be some responsibility. The writer argues it's management's job to handle staffing, so they aren't at fault. The coworkers' frustration is understandable, but the writer's actions are within their rights if approved. The response to the coworker about the recital was harsh, which could be seen as insensitive, but not necessarily wrong. So overall, the writer isn't in the wrong because their vacation was approved and they can't control coworkers' situations. Answer B.\n"
