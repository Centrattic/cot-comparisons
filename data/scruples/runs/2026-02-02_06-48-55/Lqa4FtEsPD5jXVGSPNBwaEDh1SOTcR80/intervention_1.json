Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The person took two weeks off for vacation, and their coworkers are upset, especially since some are parents struggling financially and the team gets short-staffed. The author's manager approved the leave, but the coworkers are upset.\n\nFirst, the author is taking vacation time they've saved up. Legally, if the manager approved it, they have the right to take that time. But the coworkers are parents dealing with kids and financial stress. The author mentions not needing two weeks but taking it anyway. They also responded harshly to a coworker whose child's recital they might be affecting. \n\nThe key points are: the author planned ahead, manager approved, but the team feels overburdened. The author's response to the coworker about the recital was dismissive. Taking vacation is a right, but considering the impact on others is important. Maybe the author should have communicated better or checked in with the team, but they did plan four months ahead. However, being insensitive in their response could be seen as a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. They aren't in the wrong for taking legal vacation, but their attitude and comments might be. But the question is whether they are at fault overall. If the manager approved, maybe not. But the coworkers' stress is real. It's a bit of a grey area. The author's justification is valid, but their response to the coworker was harsh. Maybe a B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The answer is probably B.\n"
