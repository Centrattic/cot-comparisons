Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, especially when coworkers are upset and the team is short-staffed. \n\nFirst, the author has two jobs and is child-free, which allows them to travel. They mention that coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially. That's a context clue. The coworkers might be jealous or feeling stressed because they can't take similar time off. \n\nThe coworker called the author an asshole for taking the vacation. The author's defense is that they have saved time, the manager approved it, and it's been planned for four months. However, the author is leaving the team short-staffed, and one coworker had to miss a kid's recital. The author dismissed that by saying the kid will have hundreds of recitals and the father can go instead.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Legally, if the manager approved, the author isn't breaking any rules. But morally, is it wrong to take a vacation if it impacts the team? Even if management is responsible for staffing, taking a two-week leave might create a burden for others. The author's comment about the coworker's recital might come off as insensitive. While the author has a right to use their PTO, the way they responded could be seen as dismissive of others' personal situations. \n\nHowever, the author is also entitled to their vacation time, especially if it's been planned and approved. The coworkers' frustration might stem from their own situations, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key points are: management's approval, prior planning, and the author's right to vacation. The coworkers might be upset, but the author isn't in the wrong unless they violated company policy. The author's response to the coworker was harsh, but the main issue is whether taking the vacation itself is wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for taking a planned, approved vacation. But there's a moral consideration about how they handled the coworkers' concerns. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about violating rules or ethics. Since the manager approved it, the author is within their rights. The coworkers' upset is more about empathy, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
