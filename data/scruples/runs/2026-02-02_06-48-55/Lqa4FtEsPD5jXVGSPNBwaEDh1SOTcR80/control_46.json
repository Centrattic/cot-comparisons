Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for taking a two-week vacation, given the coworkers' reactions. \n\nFirst, the author works two jobs to afford travel and is child-free, so they have the flexibility. They've been planning the vacation for four months and have saved time off. Their manager approved it, which suggests the company isn't against it. However, the coworkers are mostly parents or single parents struggling financially, and they feel short-staffed when the author takes time off.\n\nThe coworker called the author an asshole for taking two weeks. The author argues that it's not their problem if the team is short-staffed; that's management's responsibility. They also dismissed a coworker's issue about missing a kid's recital by saying there are many recitals and the father can attend instead.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility and empathy. The author has a valid point that vacation time is earned and approved by management. They've planned this for a while, so it's not a last-minute decision. However, the coworkers are in difficult situations, and the author's response to the coworker's problem about the recital might come off as dismissive. \n\nIs it about the right to take vacation versus the impact on coworkers? Legally and by company policy, if the manager approved, the author isn't in the wrong. But socially, coworkers might feel that taking two weeks is excessive, especially if it adds stress on others. The author's comment about the recital could be seen as lacking empathy, which might contribute to the negative reactions. \n\nBut the author isn't at fault for taking their own vacation. Management should have covered the staffing issues. The coworkers' struggles are their own challenges, and the author isn't responsible for solving them. The main issue here is the author's tone when dismissing the coworker's problem, but that's more about interpersonal skills than being in the wrong about taking the vacation itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for taking the vacation, especially with management approval and planning. The coworkers' frustration is understandable but not the author's responsibility. The answer should be B (No).\n"
