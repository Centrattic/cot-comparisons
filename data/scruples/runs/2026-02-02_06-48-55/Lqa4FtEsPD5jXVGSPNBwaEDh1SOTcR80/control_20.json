Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is going on vacation for two weeks and coworkers are upset, especially since they're child-free and work two jobs. The coworkers are parents struggling, and one even called the author an asshole. The author says they've planned this for four months, and management approved it. They also mention that the team is short-staffed, but that's management's responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If management approved the vacation, then technically, the author followed the proper channels. Management is responsible for scheduling and coverage, so if they approved it, maybe they have a plan in place. The coworkers are upset, but the author isn't at fault for management's decisions.\n\nAlso, the author's personal situation is that they work two jobs to afford travel, and they haven't seen their parents in Florida since moving. Health issues with parents make the visit important. The author's response about the coworker missing a recital seems harsh, but it's possible the coworker is venting frustration. The author's comment might come off as insensitive, but it's not clear if they crossed a line.\n\nCoworkers being ganged up on the author might be due to their own stress from being overworked, especially if they're parents and dealing with financial struggles. The author's justification is about having saved time and planning ahead. \n\nHowever, even if the author is within their rights, the social dynamics matter. Taking two weeks off could indeed cause strain on the team. But if management is aware and okay with it, maybe the team should handle it. The author isn't responsible for the team's workload, unless they didn't communicate properly. The author has been planning for four months, so maybe they should have planned around that time.\n\nThe key points are: management approved, the author followed procedures, and the author isn't at fault for team coverage. However, the response to the coworker about the recital might be a misstep, but it's not necessarily the main issue. The main question is about taking vacation. Since management approved, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
