Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation despite coworkers' complaints. \n\nFirst, the author works two jobs to afford travel, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. They have saved time off, and their manager approved the leave. The coworkers are mostly parents struggling financially, and one coworker's kid's recital is affected. The author responded by saying the kid will have many recitals and the spouse can attend instead.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, taking vacation is a personal choice. They have the time saved and manager approval. However, leaving the team short-staffed might impact coworkers, especially if management isn't addressing it. The coworker's issue with missing a recital could be a valid concern. But the author's response was dismissive, which might come off as insensitive. However, the main issue is whether the vacation itself is wrong. Since management approved it, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the way they handled the coworker's complaint could be problematic. The answer might hinge on empathy and communication. But according to the rules, the options are A or B. Considering that the author has a right to use their accrued time and the manager approved it, even if the coworkers are upset, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The coworkers' struggles are their own, but the author isn't responsible for the staffing issues caused by others' absences. The dismissive comment might be unkind, but the act of taking approved vacation isn't inherently wrong.\n"
