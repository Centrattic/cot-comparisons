Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves taking a two-week vacation despite coworkers' disapproval. The author works two jobs, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. They have saved time off and management approved the vacation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has taken time off with management approval, which is important. Management is responsible for staffing, so if the team is short-staffed, that's their job to handle. The coworkers are parents struggling financially and might be stressed about covering shifts. The author's response to the coworker about missing a recital by saying the father can go seems harsh. Maybe that's where the problem lies.\n\nBut the author did plan the vacation four months in advance, which gives management time to adjust. They also have saved time, so it's not like they're using unpaid leave. The coworkers' frustration could be about the team being short-staffed, but it's management's responsibility, not the author's. However, the author's dismissive comment about the recital might have been insensitive. Even though it's true that there will be more recitals, the way it was said could hurt the coworker's feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The act of taking approved vacation isn't wrong, but the way they handled the coworkers' concerns might be. However, the author isn't responsible for staffing issues. The coworkers might be projecting their own stress. The author's comment was rude, but the vacation itself is justified. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled the situation better. But the question is if they're in the wrong, not if their response was appropriate. The vacation itself is okay, so answer B.\n"
