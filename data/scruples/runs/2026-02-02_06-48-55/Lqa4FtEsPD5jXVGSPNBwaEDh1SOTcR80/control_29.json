Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a two-week vacation and being criticized by coworkers.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have two jobs, are child-free, and can afford to travel. They\u2019re going to visit parents who are having health issues and haven't seen them in two years. They saved up time off, and their manager approved it. However, coworkers are upset because they're parents, struggling financially, and the team might be short-staffed. The coworker called them an asshole, and the author responded harshly about the kid's recital.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the manager's approval, which suggests the company supports the leave. The author has the right to use their accrued vacation time. But the coworkers are in a different situation\u2014parents with financial stress. The author's response about the recital might have been insensitive, even if they were defending their right to take time off.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, taking vacation is a basic right, and if management approved it, the author isn't at fault there. But maybe the way they responded to the coworker about the recital was unkind. However, the coworker was being critical, so maybe the author felt justified. The coworkers' criticism might be more about their own stress rather than the author's actions.\n\nThe main issue is whether using vacation time is wrong. Since it's approved and the author has the time saved, they aren't in the wrong. The coworkers' problems are their own, and the author isn't responsible for the team being short-staffed. Management should handle staffing. The harsh response to the coworker was probably unkind, but it doesn't make the author wrong about taking the vacation. So the answer is B.\n"
