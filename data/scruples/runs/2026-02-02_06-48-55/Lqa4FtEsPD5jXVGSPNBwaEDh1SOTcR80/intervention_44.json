Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is at fault. The person took two weeks off for vacation, which their coworkers are upset about. The coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially, and they feel the team is short-staffed because of this. The author defends their decision by saying they work two jobs to afford travel, have saved up time, and their manager approved the leave. They even told a coworker that their kid will have many recitals and the spouse can attend instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is child-free, which allows them to take more time off compared to coworkers with kids. Taking two weeks off isn't illegal, but the social dynamics in the workplace matter. The coworkers are upset because they might have to cover more work, especially if they're already struggling. The author's manager approved the leave, so from a management standpoint, it's okay. However, the author's response to the coworker about the recital seems dismissive. Saying the kid will have \"hundreds\" of recitals and suggesting the spouse can go might come off as insensitive. Even if it's true, the way it's said could hurt a coworker who's stressed about work-life balance.\n\nThe author argues it's not their problem if the team is short-staffed. But in reality, when someone takes time off, it affects the team. Good workplace etiquette would involve considering colleagues' situations, even if the company allows the leave. The fact that they planned it four months ahead is good, but maybe they should have checked with the team or offered to help with coverage. The author's justification about seeing parents with health issues is valid, but the length of the vacation (two weeks) might be seen as excessive, especially if the team isn't adequately staffed otherwise. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to use their accrued vacation time. The manager's approval suggests the company isn't against it. The coworkers' resentment might stem from their own stress rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking the vacation, but the way they handled the coworkers' concerns (especially the recital comment) could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the core issue is whether they are at fault for taking the vacation itself. Since the manager approved and it's their earned time, they aren't in the wrong. The AITA aspect might be more about the coworkers' frustration than the author's actual fault.\n"
