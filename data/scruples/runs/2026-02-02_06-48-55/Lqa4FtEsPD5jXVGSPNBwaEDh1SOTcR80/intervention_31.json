Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author takes two weeks of vacation, which their coworkers are upset about. The coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially, and one coworker even calls the author an asshole. The author works two jobs, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. They have saved up time off and the manager approved it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has the right to take vacation time, especially if it's approved by management. Using accrued time is generally acceptable in most workplaces. However, the coworkers are upset because they feel the author is making their workload harder. The author's response to the coworker about the kid's recital was harsh, which could have contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe author mentions that they have been planning the vacation for four months, so it's not a last-minute decision. Management's approval suggests that they should have the resources to cover the absence. However, the author's comment about the recital might have been insensitive. Even though the author is within their rights to take time off, the way they responded to a coworker's personal issue could be seen as dismissive. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and according to workplace policies, taking approved vacation is not wrong. However, the social dynamics and empathy aspect might affect the perception. The coworkers are in a tough situation, and the author's dismissive response might have made it worse. \n\nThe author argues that the team being short-staffed is management's problem, which is true. But the way they handled the conflict with the coworker could be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong for taking the vacation, but their response to the coworker's personal situation might make them come off as insensitive, which could make others think they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the focus is on taking the vacation (which is justified) versus the interpersonal response (which could be improved). If the question is strictly about the vacation, the answer is B. If considering the response to the coworker, it's A. But since the main question is about the vacation, the answer is B.\n"
