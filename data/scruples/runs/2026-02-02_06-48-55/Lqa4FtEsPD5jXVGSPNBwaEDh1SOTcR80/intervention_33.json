That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone taking two weeks of vacation, which their coworkers are upset about, especially since the coworkers are parents struggling with work-life balance. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author works two jobs to afford travel, which is their own choice. They haven't taken time off in a while since moving, and they want to see their parents who are having health issues. The coworker called them an asshole because they're taking two weeks off, and the team is short-staffed. The author says they've planned this for four months and management approved it. They also mentioned that a coworker had to miss a kid's recital, and the author told her that her husband could attend instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are: vacation planning, management approval, coworkers' stress, and the author's response to a coworker's personal issue. The author's defense is that they have saved time, management approved, and it's their personal time. But the coworkers are struggling, especially single parents, and they're upset about being short-staffed.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to use their vacation time as per company policy, especially if approved by management. On the other hand, taking two weeks might exacerbate the team's workload, especially if coworkers are already stressed. The author's dismissive comment about missing a recital might have come off as insensitive.\n\nI need to consider workplace norms. Generally, employees can take vacation if approved, but if it's causing hardship for the team, maybe there's a responsibility to consider that. However, the author did plan ahead and informed management. The coworkers' reactions might be more about their own stress than the author's actions. But the author might not be considering the team's perspective enough.\n\nThe key is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the vacation is properly scheduled and approved, maybe they're not. But if the timing causes undue hardship, maybe they are. The answer might depend on company policies and how the author communicated. Since management approved, it's possible they're in the right. However, the author's response to the coworker's personal issue could be seen as harsh, which might affect workplace relations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for taking the vacation but could be seen as insensitive in their response to the coworker. But the main question is about the vacation itself. If the company allows it and management approved, then technically, they're not at fault. However, the social dynamics in the workplace might mean they come off as uncaring. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
