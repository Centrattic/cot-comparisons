Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, especially after their coworkers, who are parents, are upset. The user works two jobs to afford travel, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. The coworkers are single parents struggling, and one even called them an asshole. The manager approved the leave, but the team is short-staffed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user has saved up time, planned for months, and management approved it. Legally, if the time off was approved, they're probably not in the wrong. However, the social aspect is tricky. The coworkers are facing hardships; missing a kid's recital is a big deal for a parent. The user's response about the kid having \"hundreds of recitals\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the user isn't legally at fault, their reaction could be seen as insensitive. Management's role here is crucial\u2014they should handle staffing issues. The user might not be in the wrong for taking the vacation, but their reaction to coworkers' struggles might have been harsh. Balancing personal time with empathy is key here. So, while the vacation is their right, the way they responded could have been more considerate.\n"
