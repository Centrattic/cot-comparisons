Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author taking two weeks off for vacation, which has caused some backlash from coworkers and a coworker calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details provided. The author works two jobs to afford traveling and is child-free, which allows them to take time off. They moved from Florida to New England and haven't seen their parents in two years, who are now having health issues. The coworker is upset because the author's vacation is causing the team to be short-staffed, and another coworker might miss a kid's recital. The author's manager approved the vacation, so that's a point in their favor.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A for Yes (author is wrong) and B for No (not wrong). \n\nI need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to use their saved time off, especially if it's been planned for months and management approved it. They have a valid reason to visit parents with health issues and haven't been able to see them since moving. The author is also working two jobs, which might mean they need the vacation to recharge.\n\nOn the other hand, coworkers are struggling, being single parents, and the author's vacation is causing them to be short-staffed. The author's response to the coworker about missing a recital might have been harsh, suggesting the child will have many recitals and the father can attend. This could come off as dismissive of the coworker's situation.\n\nHowever, the author isn't responsible for the staffing issues; that's management's job. The author has been planning this for months, so it's not a last-minute decision. The manager's approval adds credibility to the author's stance. The coworkers being upset might be more about their own stress and not the author's fault. The author's reasoning for taking the trip (seeing parents with health problems) is valid and personal.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to use their own time, the manager's approval, and the personal reasons for the trip. While the response to the coworker about the recital was maybe tactless, the core issue of taking vacation time seems justified. The coworkers' frustrations might stem from their own situations rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their vacation, it's been planned and approved, and the staffing issues are management's responsibility. The coworkers' reactions might be more about their own stress and the author's different life circumstances rather than the author being in the wrong.\n"
