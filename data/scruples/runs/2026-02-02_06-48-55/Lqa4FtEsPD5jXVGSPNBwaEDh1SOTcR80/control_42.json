Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking a two-week vacation, and coworkers are upset, especially since they are parents and struggling. The author works two jobs to afford travel, and the coworkers are single parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. The manager approved the vacation, so officially, it's allowed. That's a point in the author's favor. But the coworkers are upset because they're being short-staffed. The author says it's not their problem, which might come off as insensitive. \n\nThe coworker missed a kid's recital because of covering for the author. The author responded by saying the kid will have more recitals and the father can go. That sounds harsh. Even if it's true, the way it's said might seem dismissive. \n\nThe coworker called the author an asshole. That's pretty harsh too. But the author is also in a position to afford this vacation, being child-free and working two jobs. The coworkers are struggling, so maybe they feel the author isn't considering their situations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They did follow procedures by getting approval. But maybe they should have considered the team's workload and communicated better. However, the main issue is whether taking the vacation itself is wrong. Since it's approved, technically the author isn't in the wrong. But their response to the coworker's problem might have been unkind. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong for going on vacation. The answer depends on whether the vacation is allowed and if the author is responsible for the team's workload. Since management approved it, it's not the author's fault that the team is short-staffed. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong. However, their response to the coworker could be improved, but the main act of taking the vacation isn't their fault.\n"
