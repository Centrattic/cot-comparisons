Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking a two-week vacation and getting criticism from coworkers and a co-worker who called them an asshole. The author has two jobs, is child-free, and the coworkers are parents struggling financially. The author is going to Florida to see parents who have health issues and can't visit. They have saved time off and the manager approved it. The coworkers are upset because the team is short-staffed, and one coworker missed a kid's recital because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has the right to take vacation time, especially if it's approved by management. However, the coworkers are facing hardships. The author mentions that the team is short-staffed, but they argue it's management's problem. The response to the coworker about the recital might have come off as dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn one hand, employees have the right to use their vacation days, and the manager's approval suggests it's acceptable. On the other hand, the coworkers are dealing with significant stress, and the author's vacation might be exacerbating their workload. The author's comment about the recital seems harsh, which could contribute to the negative reaction. \n\nAlso, the author is using their own earned vacation time, which is a legitimate right. However, the situation might be more complex if the team is consistently understaffed and management isn't addressing it. The coworkers' struggles as parents and financial issues add context to their frustration. \n\nThe author's justification for going to see parents with health issues is understandable, but the length of the vacation (two weeks) might be a point of contention. The fact that they planned it four months in advance suggests they tried to give notice, but if the team can't handle the coverage, it's a management issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, employees can't be held responsible for management's staffing decisions. However, the author's response to the coworker about the recital being replaced by the father might have been uncaring. It's possible that the author's actions aren't wrong, but their communication could have been more empathetic. \n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking a vacation, especially if it's approved. However, their response to the coworker's situation might have been insensitive. But the core issue is about using earned vacation time, which the author has a right to do. Management is responsible for ensuring adequate staffing. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for nuance.\n"
