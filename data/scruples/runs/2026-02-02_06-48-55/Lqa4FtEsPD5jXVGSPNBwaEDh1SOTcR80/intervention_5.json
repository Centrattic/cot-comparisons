Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking a two-week vacation, and coworkers are upset. The author mentions they work two jobs to afford the trip and haven't seen their parents since moving, who have health issues. They also say they've been planning this for four months and management approved it.\n\nHmm. First, the author is using the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format, so they're probably expecting a judgment. The question is whether they're wrong to take the vacation. The coworkers are all parents or single parents struggling financially, and some are affected by the staff shortage. The author responded harshly to a coworker missing a kid's recital, saying the kid would have many recitals and the coworker's father could go. That part might be a red flag. \n\nOn one hand, taking a vacation is a personal right, and management approved it, so maybe it's not their fault. They have time saved up and are using it. On the other hand, coworkers are struggling, and their absence might exacerbate the workload. The author's response to the coworker about the recital could come off as dismissive and uncaring. Even if the author has a valid reason to visit their parents, the comment about the child's recital might be seen as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude of \"not my problem\" if the team is short-staffed. While management is responsible for staffing, the author's decision to take the vacation without considering the team's situation could be seen as thoughtless. The coworkers are in a tough spot financially and personally, so maybe the author should have tried to mitigate the impact or showed more empathy. \n\nThe key points here are the insensitive comment and the attitude towards the team's workload. Even if the vacation is justified, how the author handled the coworkers' concerns might make them the AITA. So the answer is probably A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
