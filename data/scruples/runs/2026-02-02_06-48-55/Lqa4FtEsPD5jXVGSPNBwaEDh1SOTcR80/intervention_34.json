Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for taking two weeks of vacation, especially since coworkers are upset about it. The author works two jobs to afford the trip, is child-free, and hasn't seen their parents since moving. They got called an asshole by a coworker, and others are upset because it leaves the team short. The manager approved the time off, though.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and company policy aspects. If the author has accrued the vacation time and it's approved by management, then from a company policy standpoint, they're probably in the right. But the coworkers' reactions are about the impact on their work-life balance. The coworker mentioned missing a kid's recital because they have to cover, which is a personal issue. The author responded by saying the kid will have many recitals and the spouse can go instead. That might come off as dismissive, which could be where the conflict arises.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the vacation. Legally and by policy, no. But socially, the way they responded to the coworker's concern might be seen as insensitive. The author's reasoning is that it's management's job to handle staffing, and they've planned this for months. However, if taking two weeks off causes significant strain on the team, maybe the author should have considered that. But management's approval suggests they handle the staffing issues. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the response to the coworker. The author's comment about the recital might have been harsh, contributing to the coworkers' anger. However, the main issue is the vacation itself. If the company allows it and it's approved, then the author isn't in the wrong for taking it. The coworkers might be struggling with their own situations and taking it out on the author. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the company approved it, and the author has the right to use their vacation as they see fit.\n"
