Coworkers state I am.\nSo I am child free so I am able to travel and I work 2 jobs so that I can travel. My coworkers are all parents/single parents and are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThis coworker came up to me and called an asshole because I was taking 2 weeks off to go to Florida. I have relocated from Florida to New England about 2 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since I moved. They won\u2019t come up to visit and they are having health issues. Granted I don\u2019t need to take two weeks off but I have the time saved up so I might as well. \n\nApparently I am leaving the team short staffed. Again not my problem. That is something that management has to handle and I have been planning this for about 4 months. Everyone has been ganging up on me about me leaving. My manager has approved it so she has no issues with it.\n\nOne person has told me that they have to miss a recital for their kid. I told the coworker off stating that her kid will have hundreds of recitals and her father can go in your place. \n\nTDLR; I\u2019m going away for 2 weeks for a vacation and leaving my team short staffed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a two-week vacation, especially since their coworkers are upset. The author works two jobs to afford travel and is child-free, while their coworkers are parents or single parents struggling financially. One coworker called them an asshole because they were taking time off. The author's manager approved the leave, and they've planned it four months in advance. They also mentioned that leaving the team short-staffed is management's problem, not theirs. The coworker had to miss a kid's recital, and the author responded that the kid has many recitals and the father can go instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has a right to use their vacation time, especially if they've saved up and planning for months. Management approved it, so they aren't violating company policy. The coworkers' frustration is understandable, especially if they're dealing with family responsibilities and financial stress. However, the author's decision to take time off, while perhaps causing some team strain, is a personal choice that's been pre-approved. The author's response about the recital seems harsh, but maybe they were just trying to be practical. \n\nIs it the author's fault that their coworkers are struggling? Not necessarily. However, maybe they should have considered team dynamics more. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The coworkers are upset, but unless the author violated company policy or acted unethically, they aren't in the wrong. The manager's approval is key here. The answer is likely B (No), because using vacation time properly isn't the author's fault, even if others are upset.\n"
