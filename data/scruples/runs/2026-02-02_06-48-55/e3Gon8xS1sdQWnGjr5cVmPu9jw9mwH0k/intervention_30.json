I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for getting their girlfriend a gym membership as a birthday gift. The context is that the girlfriend gained weight and mentioned wanting to join a gym. The author didn't mention the weight gain but got the gym membership anyway.\n\nHmm, so the girlfriend felt insulted. The author's intention was good, but maybe the gift came off as a criticism of her weight. Even if the author meant well, the girlfriend received it as an insult. That's a classic case where intentions vs. perceptions clash.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, if she's already aware of her weight gain and feels self-conscious, a gym membership as a gift could be seen as a subtle way of pointing out her weight. The author says they were careful not to mention it, but maybe the action itself was the trigger. People often internalize such messages even if they're not explicitly stated.\n\nI think the key here is empathy. The girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author should have considered how the gift might be perceived, even if their intention was to support her. Maybe a conversation first would have been better. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact of the gift, regardless of their good intentions.\n"
