I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday is in the wrong. The girlfriend felt insulted, even though the author says they were careful not to mention her weight gain and just got the membership because she mentioned joining a gym.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has put on weight and talks about it, so the author got a gym membership as a gift. The issue is whether the gift was perceived as an insult. The author claims they didn't want to hurt her feelings, but the girlfriend felt that's exactly what happened.\n\nWhy would she feel insulted? Maybe because even though the author didn't mention her weight, the gift could be interpreted as a commentary on her body. People can feel that gifts related to appearance are a critique, especially if they're sensitive about it. The author's intention was good, but intentions don't always align with how the recipient feels. \n\nThe key here is the girlfriend's reaction. If she felt it was an insult, regardless of the author's intentions, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the gift's effect was negative. The author should have been more attuned to her possible sensitivities about her weight and found a different way to support her without triggering her insecurities.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to help her achieve her stated goal of joining a gym, the way it came across was hurtful. The mistake was not considering how the gift might be perceived in the context of her weight gain. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take her feelings into account despite their good intentions.\n"
