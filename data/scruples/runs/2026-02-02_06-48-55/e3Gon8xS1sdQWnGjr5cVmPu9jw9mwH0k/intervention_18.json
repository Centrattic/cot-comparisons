I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a gym membership as a birthday gift. The girlfriend gained weight and was talking about joining a gym, but she felt insulted by the gift. The author says they were careful not to mention her weight gain, just got the gym membership because she mentioned it.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the intent versus the perception. The author's intention was to support her gym goal, but the girlfriend felt it was an insult. Even if the author didn't mean to, the gift came across as pointing out her weight gain. Relationships often hinge on how things are perceived, not just the intention. Maybe the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might be sensitive about her weight and didn't want it to be the focus of a gift. The girlfriend might have wanted support in a different way or might have been embarrassed. Even if the author was careful not to mention weight, the gift itself could be seen as a reminder of the weight gain she's already self-conscious about. So, while the author didn't have ill intent, they might not have communicated well or understood her feelings. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
