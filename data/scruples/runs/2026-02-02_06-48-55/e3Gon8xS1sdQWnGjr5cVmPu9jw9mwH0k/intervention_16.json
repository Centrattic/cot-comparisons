I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday is in the wrong. The girlfriend gained weight and often mentions wanting to join a gym. The gift didn't go well because she felt it was an insult, implying he was commenting on her weight. The author says he was careful not to mention her weight gain and just wanted to help.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the girlfriend's sensitivity about her weight, the author's intention, and how the gift was received. Even though the author didn't mean to insult, the girlfriend felt it was an insult. That's important. People have different sensitivities, and even if the intention is good, the receiver's feelings matter. The fact that the girlfriend was already self-conscious and the gift focused on a gym (which she associated with needing to lose weight) might have triggered her. The author might not have considered how the gift could be perceived as pointing out her weight gain, despite not mentioning it. So, even if the intention was to help, the action led to hurt feelings. Maybe the author should have chosen a different gift that supports her without focusing on weight. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact of the gift, even if unintended.\n"
