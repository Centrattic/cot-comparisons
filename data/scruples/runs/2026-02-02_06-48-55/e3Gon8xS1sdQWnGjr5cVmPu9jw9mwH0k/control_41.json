I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday is in the wrong. The girlfriend gained weight over winter, and she often mentions wanting to join a gym. The guy got her the membership, but she felt it was an insult.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent versus the perception. The guy says he didn't mention her weight gain and just wanted to give her something she asked for. But the girlfriend interpreted it as him pointing out her weight, which hurt her feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong. Well, even if his intention was good, the result was that she felt insulted. Sometimes, even if you mean well, the action can be hurtful. The fact that she's already sensitive about her weight gain and he gave her a gym membership might have come off as a reminder of her self-consciousness. \n\nHe might not have realized how personal that gift was, especially since she was already talking about it. Maybe he didn't consider her feelings about being reminded of her weight gain, even though she mentioned wanting a gym. It's a classic case of the gift being something she wanted but the context made it uncomfortable. \n\nSo, from an outside perspective, even if he didn't mean to insult her, he should have considered how she might feel about the gift given the weight issue. He might have overlooked the emotional aspect. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he didn't take into account her sensitivity around the topic.\n"
