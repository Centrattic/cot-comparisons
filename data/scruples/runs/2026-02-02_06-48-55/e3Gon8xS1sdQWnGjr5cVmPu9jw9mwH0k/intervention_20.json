I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has gained weight and mentioned she needs to join a gym, so he got her a membership. But she was upset and felt it was an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to support her, as she had expressed wanting to join a gym. He said he was careful not to mention her weight gain, so he thought he was helping. However, the girlfriend felt insulted, interpreting the gift as a comment on her weight. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to imply she's fat, the gift might still come across as judgmental. People's sensitivities vary, and weight is a sensitive topic. While the intention was good, the action might not have been the best approach. The key point is whether the action was respectful of her feelings. Since she felt insulted, maybe the author should have considered other ways to support her without focusing on the gym, which could be associated with weight loss. \n\nSo, even though the intention was positive, the execution might have been insensitive. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering her feelings when choosing the gift.\n"
