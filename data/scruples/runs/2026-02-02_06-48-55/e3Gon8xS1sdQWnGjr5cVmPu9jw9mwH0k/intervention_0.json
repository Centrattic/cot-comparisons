I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership as a birthday gift is in the wrong. The girlfriend gained weight over the winter, and she said the gift was an insult. The author says they didn't mention her weight and just wanted her to use the gym because she had expressed that need.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are that the girlfriend was self-conscious about her weight gain, even if the author didn't directly comment on it. The membership was intended as a helpful gift, but it came across as insensitive. The question is whether the author intended to be critical but the gesture was still wrong.\n\nI should consider the context. The girlfriend was already talking about her weight and wanting to join a gym. The author got the membership because they heard her say that. But the gift was perceived as an insult, which is about how it was received, not just the intention. Even if the author didn't mean to, if the girlfriend felt it was a passive-aggressive way of pointing out her weight gain, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author claims they were careful not to mention the weight. So maybe they thought the gift was a positive way to support her. However, in relationships, it's important to be mindful of how your actions are received. If the girlfriend was already struggling with her self-image, giving her a gym membership as a gift might have been a trigger, regardless of the intention. The author should have thought about her emotional state and whether the gift could be seen as a reminder of her weight gain, even if they didn't say anything. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have overreacted, especially if the author's intention was genuinely to help her achieve her stated goal. But the fact that the gift led to her feeling insulted suggests that the author's action had an unintended negative effect. The author could have misunderstood the context of her mentioning the gym. She might have been venting about her struggle with weight, not asking for a solution. So, the author's assumption that the gym membership was the right solution might not have considered her feelings. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the author didn't take into account their girlfriend's emotional sensitivity on the topic of weight. Even if the membership was a genuine attempt to help, the way it was given and the timing (birthday gift) could have made her feel criticized. The right approach might have been to ask her more directly if she wanted the membership as a gift or if she was just expressing a desire to get in shape, rather than assuming. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider her feelings and the potential interpretation of the gift as a criticism, despite their intention.\n"
