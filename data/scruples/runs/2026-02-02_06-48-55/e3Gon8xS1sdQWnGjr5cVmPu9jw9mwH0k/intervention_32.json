I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend gained weight and mentioned she wants to join a gym. The author got the membership without directly addressing her weight, but she felt it was an insult.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help, based on the girlfriend's repeated mentions of wanting a gym membership. However, the girlfriend felt it was an insult because it might have come off as a comment on her weight gain, even if the author didn't mean it that way. The key here is about perception versus intent. Even if the author didn't intend to criticize, the action was received negatively. \n\nThe author says they were careful not to mention the weight gain, but maybe they didn't consider how the gesture would be perceived. Sometimes, even well-meaning gifts can be hurtful if they relate to sensitive issues. The girlfriend might have been frustrated about her weight and didn't want it to be highlighted, even indirectly. \n\nSo, even though the intent was good, the action caused hurt feelings. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't fully consider how the gift would be perceived, despite her expressing discomfort about the weight gain. It's possible the author should have had a more open conversation about her feelings instead of assuming a membership was the right move.\n"
