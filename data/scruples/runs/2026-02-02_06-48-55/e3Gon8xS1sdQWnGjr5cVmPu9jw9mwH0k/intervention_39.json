I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by giving a gym membership as a birthday gift. The girlfriend felt insulted because she had been talking about weight gain, and the author thought the gift was a kind gesture.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help the girlfriend start a gym membership since she mentioned wanting to join one. However, the girlfriend took it as an insult. The key here is the perception versus the intention. Even though the author didn't mean to comment on her weight, the girlfriend felt that the gift was a direct reference to her weight gain, which she was already self-conscious about.\n\nCommunication is a big part of relationships. The author mentioned being careful not to mention her weight gain, but the gift might have been a mixed message. The girlfriend might have felt that despite the author's words, the action still implied criticism. Gifts can carry unintended messages, especially when they're related to sensitive topics like body image.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's the one experiencing the feelings of being insulted. The author might not have considered how the gift would be received emotionally. Even if the intention was good, the effect on the recipient matters. In relationships, it's important to consider how the other person might perceive actions, not just the intent behind them.\n\nSo, while the author's intention wasn't to insult, the action did cause hurt feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings sufficiently and choosing a gift that, despite good intentions, had a negative impact.\n"
