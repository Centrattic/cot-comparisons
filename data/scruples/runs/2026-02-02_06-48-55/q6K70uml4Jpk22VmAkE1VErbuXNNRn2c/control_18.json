Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds views like vaccines causing autism, which he sees as pseudoscience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author ended the relationship because of her career choice and her belief in pseudoscientific practices. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't support what he views as harmful practices. The girlfriend is committed to her path, and financial support was a point of contention.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, in a relationship, major differences in core beliefs can be deal-breakers. If one partner's career involves promoting practices that the other believes are dangerous, that's a significant issue. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm, like someone with cancer not seeking proper medical treatment, is a valid concern. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and shared values, so if the author can't accept her career and beliefs, it might be a legitimate reason to break up.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is criticized for basing the breakup on material things like money and career choice. Love is supposed to transcend such things, and friends and family told him it shouldn't matter. The fact that he's feeling guilty and the breakup happened after 10 years suggests that this was a hard decision, but maybe he prioritized his values over the relationship. However, some might argue that he should have addressed these issues earlier instead of letting them build up to a breakup.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal freedom. The girlfriend has the right to pursue her career, and the author shouldn't impose his views on her. However, if he believes her work could harm others, that complicates things. It's a balance between respecting her choices and his own ethical standards.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author supported her financially, that might be a reason, but not the core issue. The main conflict is the ideological difference. In many cases, irreconcilable differences can lead to a breakup without being in the wrong. However, if the author's criticism is based on a lack of understanding or respect for her choices without sufficient dialogue, he might be at fault. But given the pseudoscientific angle, which can have real-world consequences, his stance might be seen as justified.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his values and concerns about potential harm. However, some might argue that love should overcome such differences. The answer hinges on whether the decision was made with consideration and mutual understanding or if it was a knee-jerk reaction. Since the author tried to rationalize his decision and acknowledges his feelings, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
