Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe author mentions that his girlfriend is going to attend ND school and believes in pseudoscientific ideas like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy. He feels that alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine and that NDs shouldn't abandon modern medical practices. He's also concerned about the financial burden of her 200k debt and the ethical implications of her future work, especially with cancer patients. He's feeling guilty because he broke up with her over something he sees as materialistic, like money and school choices, rather than love. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether beliefs about medicine are a valid reason to end a relationship. The author is upset because he values evidence-based medicine and is worried about the potential harm NDs might cause if they rely on pseudoscience. However, the girlfriend is pursuing a specific career path, which the author disagrees with. But is that enough to end a 10-year relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about her future practices and the possible negative impact on patients, especially in critical cases like cancer. He might feel that her beliefs could lead to harmful decisions, such as not recommending standard medical treatments. On the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing her own career, and the author's objection is based on his values, not hers. The breakup was over a fundamental difference in views on medicine and finances, which are significant but personal differences.\n\nI should also consider the role of financial responsibility. The author is worried about supporting her through 200k in debt. But relationships often involve financial sacrifices, and whether that's acceptable can vary. The author might feel that taking on that debt is not worth it if it conflicts with his values. However, is it fair to end a relationship over something as material as money, especially if both parties aren't on the same page?\n\nAnother angle is the principle of love and acceptance. The author admits that love should not be about money or views on life, but he still ended the relationship because of these differences. That might indicate that his values are so deeply held that he can't accept her path. However, if love is supposed to overcome such differences, is it wrong to prioritize one's values over the relationship?\n\nThe author's reasoning about pseudoscience is valid in a scientific context, but personal beliefs and career choices are part of one's identity. The girlfriend might see ND as a valid and ethical path, and the author's opposition could be seen as dismissive of her aspirations and beliefs. It's a matter of whether personal integrity and career goals should be non-negotiable in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The author is devastated, suggesting that the breakup was a major decision, even if he feels it was necessary. The question is whether the reasons he cited are sufficient to justify ending a long-term relationship or if he's overreacting to differences that should be respected.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are: differing views on medical practices, financial concerns, the validity of using beliefs as a reason to end a relationship, and the emotional weight of the decision. The answer depends on whether these factors are justified as a reason to break up or if the author is wrong to prioritize his values over the relationship.\n"
