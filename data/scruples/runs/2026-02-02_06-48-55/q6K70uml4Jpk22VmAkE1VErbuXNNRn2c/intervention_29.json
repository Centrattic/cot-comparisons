Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a break-up situation is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because his girlfriend wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he's concerned about her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism, which he says are disproven. He also mentions financial reasons, like her $200k debt for ND school, which he would have to support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is ending a 10-year relationship over significant differences in values and beliefs. He feels guilty because he thought love should transcend such issues. But he's also concerned about her career path and the potential harm in her future practice, given her beliefs. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend is pursuing a legitimate educational path, even if he disagrees with her views. Naturopathic medicine is a real field, though it's controversial. The author's problem is with the pseudoscientific aspects and the financial burden. However, is it fair to break up over someone's career choice and beliefs, even if they conflict with his own?\n\nOn the other hand, the author believes that love should be about caring, not material or ideological differences. But when core values clash, especially regarding health practices (like vaccine denial), that can create real conflict. If he can't support her in a way that respects her choices, maybe the break-up is a result of incompatibility rather than being in the wrong. \n\nHe also mentions that he discussed this with family and friends, who said it shouldn't matter. But he still feels conflicted. The financial aspect adds another layer\u2014supporting her education would be a significant commitment, and he might not be willing to take on that debt. However, should that be a deal-breaker in a long-term relationship?\n\nIt's a tough situation. The author is prioritizing his own values and concerns about health science over his partner's aspirations. But he's also acknowledging that love should be more than these issues, which makes him feel guilty. However, if their fundamental views on health and science are irreconcilable, maybe the break-up is a result of incompatible long-term goals. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether his reasons for breaking up are valid. If he can't accept her career and beliefs, which are important to her, even after trying to work through it, then it might be a matter of personal choice rather than being wrong. Relationships require compromise, and if both can't meet in the middle, ending it isn't necessarily the wrong choice. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
