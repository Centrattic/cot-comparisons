Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that they've been in a 10-year relationship and broke up because his girlfriend wants to become an ND. He has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience, like the anti-vax stance and homeopathy. He feels that this is a problem because he values modern medicine, and he can't support her going into a field he disagrees with. Also, he's concerned about the financial aspect of her attending ND school, which would put her in $200k debt, which he would have to support. He's feeling guilty for breaking up over this, thinking it's materialistic and not about love, but he's struggling with the future visions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the factors that make a relationship work. Compatibility is a big one. If two people have fundamentally different beliefs that affect major life decisions, that can be a problem. The author is concerned about his partner's career choice because he believes it's based on pseudoscience, which he sees as dangerous. He also brings up financial concerns, which is a practical aspect of a relationship. \n\nBut is it fair to break up over this? On one hand, if someone's career choice is based on beliefs that you strongly disagree with, especially when it comes to medical practices that could impact patients, that's a significant issue. Health care is a serious matter, and if the girlfriend is going to be making decisions that the author thinks could harm others, like relying on unscientific treatments, that could be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships often require compromise. Maybe the author could have tried to work through the differences instead of breaking up. However, if their core values are too conflicting, it might be unsustainable. The financial burden is also a practical concern. Taking on $200k debt is a huge commitment, and if the author isn't willing to support that, that's a real issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's commitment to her career and beliefs is also important. If she's dead set on this path, and the author can't support her, then maybe the relationship isn't viable. The author's guilt comes from the idea that love should override all else, but in reality, relationships need to align on major life aspects. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is overstepping by judging her career choice based on his own values. He mentions that NDs have a place as an alternative, but he can't condone giving up modern medicine. However, if she is going into a field that he fundamentally disagrees with, especially regarding patient outcomes, it's a conflict of ethics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the breakup is primarily about financial support and differing values, it's a matter of personal choice. If he's not willing to support her financially, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, if the main issue is her career being based on pseudoscience, that's a deeper ethical concern. The author might believe he's making the right choice by not supporting her career, but others might see it as being too rigid in his views.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the breakup is due to incompatible values and the financial commitment he can't bear, then it's a personal decision. But if the main issue is her career path which he deems unethical, then maybe it's about his ethical stance. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that relationships require mutual respect and compatibility, if they can't agree on such a significant aspect, the breakup might be justified. However, if he's dismissing her career choice based on his own biases without understanding her perspective, that could be where he's in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because in relationships, differing fundamental values can be a valid reason to end things, especially when it comes to health and science, which are critical areas.\n"
