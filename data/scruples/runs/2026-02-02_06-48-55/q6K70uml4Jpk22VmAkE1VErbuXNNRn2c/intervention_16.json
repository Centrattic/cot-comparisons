Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the break-up story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and he disagrees with her views on pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccines. He's feeling guilty because he ended a 10-year relationship over this, but he's conflicted about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about differing views on medical science. He values evidence-based medicine and is concerned about pseudoscience, especially in a field that deals with serious illnesses like cancer. He also brings up financial concerns, mentioning the $200k debt for her ND school, which he says he would have to support. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her career path, believing in alternative medicine and practices that the author considers outdated or unscientific. The author feels that love should transcend such issues, but in practice, their fundamental disagreements have made it impossible for him to continue the relationship.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know what I think. The question is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship or if he's wrong for doing so. \n\nI need to consider if his reasons are valid. Disagreements over core values can be a legitimate reason for ending a relationship. However, the author seems to be using the financial aspect as a catalyst here. He mentions that the debt would be a problem, but also that her beliefs (like vaccines causing autism) are pseudoscientific. This raises the question of whether personal beliefs that could affect life choices, especially in healthcare decisions, are a valid concern. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of respecting each other's choices. If the girlfriend is passionate about her career and the author can't support her in that, maybe the relationship was never going to work. However, the author is also using money as an excuse, which could be a way to avoid deeper issues. \n\nAlso, the emotional toll on the author is evident. He's hurting and feels like he's made a mistake. The question is whether his decision was based on valid concerns or if he's overstepping by ending the relationship over her career choice. \n\nIn relationships, when core values conflict, especially ones that affect major life decisions, it's often hard to reconcile. However, the author's approach might come off as dismissive of her personal goals and beliefs. The fact that he's feeling so guilty suggests he's aware that there might be something wrong with his reasoning, even if he believes the decision was necessary. \n\nThe key points here are the validity of the reasons for breaking up. If the girlfriend's career choices directly impact the author's ability to support her financially and their future together, that's a legitimate concern. But if it's more about differing beliefs in pseudoscience versus evidence-based medicine, that's a different matter. \n\nI should also consider whether the author's concerns about pseudoscience are valid. If the girlfriend's practices could lead to harm (e.g., advising against vaccinations or relying on homeopathy instead of medical treatment), that's a serious issue. However, the author might be conflating his personal beliefs with her career choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision might be justified if the conflicting values are insurmountable and affect their future together. However, using financial reasons as a justification might not fully align with the deeper issues of differing beliefs. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives, but the author's actions might be seen as in the wrong if he's dismissing her career and beliefs out of hand without finding a middle ground.\n"
