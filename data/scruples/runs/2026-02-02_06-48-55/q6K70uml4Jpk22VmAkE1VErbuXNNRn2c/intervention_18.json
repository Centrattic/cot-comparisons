Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy broke up with his girlfriend because she's into ND, which he views as pseudoscience. He mentions her beliefs like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy. He's a big supporter of modern medicine and can't condone moving away from it. He also brings up financial concerns about her 200k debt.\n\nHe feels bad about ending a 10-year relationship over this. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still feels conflicted. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is it right to end a relationship over differing beliefs about medicine? Love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences. But there's also the aspect of core values and how they impact each other's lives. If her career choice leads to practices he finds harmful, especially in cases like cancer patients, that's a serious concern.\n\nHe's worried she might rely on pseudoscience instead of modern medicine, which could be life-threatening. That's a valid concern. But is that a deal-breaker for a relationship? It's a matter of personal ethics. He might think that her beliefs could lead to harm, which is a significant issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing her own career path, and he's not happy with the financial burden. That's more of a practical issue.\n\nThe key points are: differing core values (science vs. pseudoscience), potential ethical implications of her profession, financial responsibility, and whether these are valid reasons to end a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, people often have to compromise on various things. However, when it comes to core values that affect each other's well-being, it's a gray area. If he can't support her in a career he fundamentally disagrees with, and she's equally committed to her path, maybe it's not a sustainable relationship. But is he wrong for prioritizing his values over the relationship? Or is he wrong for using money as a reason when others say it shouldn't matter?\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. He's hurting, but he feels the breakup is necessary because of his beliefs. The girlfriend might feel that his prioritizing science over love is unfair. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say that as long as she's not harming others, it's her choice. However, in the context of healthcare, especially with serious illnesses, her approach could be seen as dangerous. So the author's concern about her providing harmful advice is a real issue. \n\nBut is it his place to make that judgment and end the relationship? If they can't find a middle ground, maybe ending the relationship is the right choice for him. However, others might argue that love should transcend such differences. \n\nI think it's complicated. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if his decision is based on preventing potential harm, but splitting over core values can be seen as valid. However, the way he ended it over money and career might be a separate issue. Maybe he should have tried to communicate better and find a compromise before breaking up. But given the seriousness of the issue, his stance could be justified. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his concerns about pseudoscience and its potential harm are valid, and relationships can break down over incompatible values. But others might see it as A because love should overcome such differences. The question is whether the user's reasoning is justifiable. Given the potential risks of her profession's approach, his decision could be seen as protecting against harm, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
