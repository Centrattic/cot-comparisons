Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions the financial burden of her ND school, which is about $200k in debt. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't accept her career path and beliefs, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issues are differences in values, specifically regarding medical beliefs and financial responsibility. The author is upset because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet he ended the relationship over those exact things. That's a bit contradictory. He also feels guilty because he brought up money as a reason, which he considers materialistic, but it was a significant factor for him.\n\nNow, looking at the situation from both sides. The girlfriend is committed to her career path, which he disagrees with. He's concerned about pseudoscience leading to harm, like if patients don't seek proper medical treatment. On the other hand, she might see her work as complementary, using alternative methods alongside modern medicine. The financial aspect is another layer\u2014supporting a $200k degree could be a big commitment, and if he's not willing to take on that debt, it's a legitimate concern for him.\n\nBut then, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate if his reasoning is valid. In relationships, differences in core values can be a reason for breaking up, but it's also about mutual respect and understanding. If he feels that her beliefs are harmful, especially in a medical context, that's a valid concern. However, he could have tried to communicate better, perhaps finding a middle ground or supporting her choices while still voicing his concerns without ending the relationship. \n\nThe fact that he brought up money as a reason might be a red flag. Love and relationships often involve compromise, and if financial support is part of the decision, it's important to discuss and agree on terms. However, if he's not willing to support her education due to differing beliefs, it might be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nAnother angle is the value of respecting someone's career choices unless they directly harm others. While he disagrees with her field, is it his place to dictate her career? Maybe she sees her work as helping people in a different way, even if he doesn't agree. The key here is whether the relationship was built on mutual respect and understanding of each other's paths.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial responsibility, ending the relationship over these issues without finding a solution might indicate that these differences were deal-breakers for him. However, breaking up over disagreements without attempting to resolve them isn't necessarily the \"wrong\" thing if it's leading to personal conflict and potential harm. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were based on respect and mutual understanding or just personal discomfort.\n"
