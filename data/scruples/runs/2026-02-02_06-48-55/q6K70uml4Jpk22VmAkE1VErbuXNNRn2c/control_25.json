Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. He's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but he couldn't reconcile their differing values.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gave for breaking up. The main points are her pseudoscientific beliefs and the financial burden of her ND school. He's concerned that she might be promoting practices that are not scientifically supported, which could harm patients, especially cancer patients. He also brings up the financial aspect, saying he would have to support her through $200k in debt.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is determined to pursue this path, believing in ND as a field. The author feels that while some alternative medicine can be good, he can't support moving away from modern science. The breakup is causing him emotional pain, and he's questioning if he's being a jerk.\n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. Breaking up over differences in life goals isn't uncommon. If two people can't compromise on major issues, it's a valid reason. But is his reasoning justified? The pseudoscience part is a red flag. If someone believes in harmful misinformation, that can affect not just their lives but others, like patients. The financial burden is a materialistic concern, which he acknowledges, but he's also concerned about the medical ethics.\n\nHowever, love and relationships often involve accepting differences. If the author couldn't accept her path despite loving her, maybe he's prioritizing his values over the relationship. But if her beliefs are based on pseudoscience, he might feel that aligning with her could lead to real harm. It's a tough balance between personal values and relationship commitment.\n\nThe question is whether his reasons are valid enough. If he's genuinely concerned about her actions leading to patient harm, that's a serious issue. But using financial issues as a main point might be seen as materialistic. However, given the pseudoscientific angle, maybe his concerns are about more than money. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points, but the author might not be in the wrong if he can't reconcile these fundamental differences. So, answer B (no, he's not in the wrong).\n"
