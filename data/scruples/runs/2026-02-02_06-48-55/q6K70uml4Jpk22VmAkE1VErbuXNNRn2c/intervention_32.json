Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The original post is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so they're looking for community judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ended the relationship because his partner wants to attend ND school, which he associates with pseudoscience like believing vaccines cause autism and homeopathy. He's concerned about her debt and the potential harm of ND practices, especially in cases where someone might rely on ND instead of medical doctors (MDs). He feels conflicted because he loved her a lot but couldn't reconcile their differing views on medicine.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the breakup is over ideological differences. Love and relationships often involve accepting each other's differences. If he's using this as a reason to break up, maybe he's prioritizing his values over their relationship. On the other hand, if he genuinely believes that ND practices can be harmful, especially in serious cases like cancer patients, that's a valid concern. Health care decisions can have life-or-death consequences, so his stance might be based on wanting to avoid potential harm.\n\nBut is it his place to decide that for her? They were in a relationship, but her career choice is her own. Unless she was actively harming others, maybe it's not his responsibility to stop her. However, he's also concerned about financial support for her education, which adds a material aspect. The question is whether that's a valid reason to end a long-term relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's career choice is important. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, it's a personal choice. The author's main issue seems to be ideological, not about her actions directly. Maybe he should have tried to address the differences in the relationship rather than ending it. But if the core values are incompatible, then maybe it's not a bad decision. The fact that he's feeling guilty suggests he's conflicted, which is common in such situations.\n\nAlso, the part about her sister graduating from the ND school and the author's belief that NDs provide placebo effects points to a lack of mutual respect. If he doesn't respect her career path, that's a significant issue in the relationship. But is it enough to end a 10-year relationship? That's where the judgment comes in.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's reasons are valid enough to justify the breakup. While his concerns about pseudoscience are legitimate, applying them to end a relationship might be overstepping. However, if he believes he can't support her in her career and the financial burden is too much, maybe it's a personal choice. The subreddit often sides with people who can't accept others' differences, so maybe the author is seen as the asshole for not accepting her choice despite loving her. But there's also a public health angle where he's concerned about potential harm from ND practices. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the breakup is based on her career choice and beliefs, which are her own, and not on any harmful actions towards him.\n"
