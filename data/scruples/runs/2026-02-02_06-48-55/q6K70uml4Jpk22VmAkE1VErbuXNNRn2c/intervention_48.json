Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she plans to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscientific aspects of her beliefs, like thinking vaccines cause autism and using homeopathy, which he considers unproven. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k student debt and the idea that she might be providing ineffective treatments to cancer patients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is ending the relationship over her career choice and beliefs. Love and relationships can be complicated, especially when there are fundamental disagreements. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author believes that love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet he ended the relationship over those very issues. That seems contradictory. The girlfriend's career choice is her personal decision, and while her beliefs might conflict with his, that's a personal matter. Ending a long-term relationship over differing beliefs and financial concerns could be seen as prioritizing his own views over the relationship. Also, his comment about her potentially causing harm by not referring to MDs is pretty harsh, which might indicate a lack of respect for her choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about pseudoscience and the potential risks of her career. If he truly believes that her approach could be harmful, especially in treating cancer patients, that's a serious ethical concern. However, it's also possible that he's overreacting or not respecting her autonomy. The financial aspect adds another layer, as he's worried about supporting her through school, which is a valid concern in a relationship, but using it as the reason to break up might be seen as prioritizing his financial comfort over the relationship.\n\nI should also consider the context of a 10-year relationship. Major disagreements can arise, but breaking up over such issues might suggest that the foundation of the relationship wasn't strong enough to handle differences. The author is conflicted, feeling wrong but also justifying his decision based on his values. The key here is whether the break-up was about respecting her choices and autonomy or about his own inability to accept differing beliefs and financial commitments.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the actions were reasonable and if the person acted with respect. The author is dismissing her career and beliefs as pseudoscience, which can be seen as disrespectful. The financial argument is a common one, but in a long-term relationship, financial support can be a valid concern. However, using it as the deciding factor to end the relationship might be seen as selfish, especially if he was okay with other financial commitments but not this one.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's feeling guilty is a red flag. If he's aware that it's a material issue but still chose to end the relationship, that might indicate that his own values are clashing with his actions, leading to guilt. The community often views guilt as a sign that the person is in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience, the way he handled the break-up by prioritizing his own views and financial concerns over the relationship and his partner's autonomy suggests that he is in the wrong. The key here is whether the break-up was about respecting her choices or his own discomfort with differing beliefs and financial responsibilities.\n"
