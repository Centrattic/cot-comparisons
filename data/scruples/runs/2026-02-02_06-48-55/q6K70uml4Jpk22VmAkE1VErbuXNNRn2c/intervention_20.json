Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation is a breakup because the girlfriend wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author is upset because they consider ND practices as pseudoscience, especially regarding beliefs like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy, etc. They also mention financial concerns about the $200k debt from ND school, which they would have to support her through. The main conflict is their differing views on medicine and the financial burden.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author feels they broke up over something material (money and school), which they regret. They love her deeply but can't reconcile the differences in medical beliefs and financial commitment. On the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career choice, which the author sees as harmful if it leads patients away from proper medical care.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Is it fair to break up over differing beliefs and career choices? Relationships often require compromise. However, if one partner's career involves practices the other finds dangerous, that's a serious issue. The author is concerned about the girlfriend's future patients potentially being harmed by relying on ND instead of MDs. That's a valid concern because healthcare is a critical area where misinformation can have real consequences.\n\nOn the financial side, the author mentions the $200k debt. If they were in a long-term relationship and planning to support each other, that's a significant financial decision. But the author could have tried to find a middle ground, like discussing financial responsibilities or exploring other solutions rather than breaking up. However, if the author truly can't support the financial burden and the career choice's ethical implications, it's a major conflict.\n\nAnother angle is personal freedom. The girlfriend has the right to pursue her career, even if the author disagrees. The author's belief that ND is pseudoscience is their own opinion, but it's not illegal or unethical for the girlfriend to choose her profession. The author's decision could be seen as imposing their views on her, which might not be fair. However, when it comes to medical practices, especially those that could harm patients, there's an ethical component to consider beyond personal choice.\n\nThe author also mentions that their friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but they feel it does. This internal conflict shows that they're struggling with their decision. The breakup was over a fundamental disagreement that both see as important, but it's unclear if there were other unresolved issues.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a toss-up. On one hand, they broke up over a significant issue that affects their values and future. On the other hand, the girlfriend's career choice might involve practices the author finds dangerous, which is a legitimate concern. The financial aspect adds another layer. If the author was willing to support her through school but couldn't do it due to the amount, that's a valid reason. But if the main issue is the medical beliefs, then it's more about differing core values.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's concerns are based on genuine ethical issues or personal dislikes. If they believe the ND field is harmful and the girlfriend is going against evidence-based medicine, that's a serious concern. However, if they're using the financial aspect as a justification for deeper disagreements, that's another matter. The author's feelings are valid, but whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the breakup was the only solution after trying to resolve the conflict through communication and compromise.\n\nSince the author mentions this was after an argument about money, maybe they didn't fully address the medical beliefs as a separate issue. It's possible they conflated both factors. The fact that the girlfriend's sister is already an ND might mean the author felt it's a family tradition or something she's really committed to, which the author might not accept. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden, breaking up over these issues might not make them the \"wrong\" person, but it does highlight significant incompatibilities. However, if the author could have found a way to support her without compromising their own values, maybe they would be at fault. But given the scenario, the author's decision is based on their own values and concerns, so they might not be entirely in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified and if they gave enough effort to find a middle ground.\n"
