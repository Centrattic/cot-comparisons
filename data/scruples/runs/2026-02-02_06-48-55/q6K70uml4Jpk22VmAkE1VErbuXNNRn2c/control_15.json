Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her career choice and beliefs, which he considers pseudoscientific. He's also concerned about financial support for her education and her views on alternative medicine versus modern science.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The breakup is based on differing values regarding medical practices. The author believes that ND's should complement, not replace, modern medicine, while his girlfriend is committed to ND with some views the author sees as harmful. He's using money as a justification but feels it's shallow. The question is whether his actions are justified.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, shared values are important. If the disagreement is about fundamental beliefs that could affect their future together, like career choices and financial commitments, that's a valid concern. The author feels that her career path is based on pseudoscience, which he might see as a risk, especially if she's treating patients. However, choosing a career is a personal decision, and while he disagrees, it's her choice.\n\nThe financial aspect is another factor. Supporting someone through a four-year ND program with $200k debt is significant. If he's not willing to take on that financial burden, it's a realistic concern. But he also mentions that his friends and family think it shouldn't matter, which adds complexity. \n\nThe emotional aspect is clear: he's hurting and feels he's wrong to end things over material issues. But from a logical standpoint, if their core beliefs about medicine are incompatible and affect their future plans, breaking up might be a result of those irreconcilable differences. However, is it fair to break up over something as personal as career choice and differing beliefs, even if he finds them misguided?\n\nI should also consider the ethical side. If her career choices lead to practices that could harm patients (like rejecting vaccinations), is that a valid reason to end the relationship? The author is concerned about her potentially causing harm, which is a serious ethical issue. But is it the role of a partner to prevent someone from pursuing a career, even if they disagree with its approach?\n\nThere's a balance between respecting individual autonomy and protecting against potential harm. The author might feel that by supporting her career, he's indirectly supporting harmful practices. However, the girlfriend might argue that she's following her passion and believes in her methods, even if others disagree.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is making a choice based on his values. If he can't reconcile his views with her career, ending the relationship is his way of prioritizing his own beliefs. But is that fair? The question is whether that makes him wrong. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on a combination of differing values, financial concerns, and ethical concerns about her career. While it's clear he's emotionally conflicted, the decision might be justified if he truly can't accept her path. However, breaking up over this could be seen as prioritizing his own views over her autonomy, which might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if the disagreement is about fundamental values affecting their future, it's a valid reason. The answer hinges on whether the disagreement is a matter of personal choice versus a potential ethical issue.\n"
