Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscience aspects of that field, like homeopathy and the belief that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her student debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gave for breaking up. He says that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his future vision conflicts with hers. The main points are her beliefs in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her education. \n\nOn one hand, relationships do require compromise. If their core values are clashing, that's a big deal. If he can't support her career choice because of his strong beliefs against the pseudoscience involved, that's a significant issue. Also, the financial aspect\u2014supporting a $200k debt\u2014might be a practical concern. But is that a valid reason to break up? Maybe if they couldn't find a solution together, but he seems to think it's insurmountable.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over her career choice and beliefs might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. People can have different beliefs, and unless those beliefs directly harm others or the relationship, it's a personal choice. However, if her career involves promoting pseudoscience that could harm patients, that's a different angle. He's worried that she might provide ineffective treatments, leading to worse outcomes for patients. But is that his place to decide? Should he have tried to convince her to pursue a different field or at least not support pseudoscience?\n\nAlso, the fact that they had a 10-year relationship suggests deep feelings. Ending it over this might indicate that the issue is more about his inability to accept her choices rather than the choices themselves. The question is whether his reasons are justifiable. If he can't support her in this important life decision, maybe it's a deal-breaker, but is it wrong to end it because of that? Or is it wrong to break up over something that's her personal and professional choice?\n\nHe also mentions that his friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but he still feels conflicted. The financial part is a practical concern, but if they were in a committed relationship, sharing financial responsibilities might be part of the commitment. However, if he's not willing to take on that debt, maybe it's a red flag about his values conflicting with hers.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if her work could potentially harm others, that's a serious concern. But the line between alternative medicine and pseudoscience can be blurry. Some people do combine ND with conventional medicine. If she's using ND as a primary treatment without considering MD, that's where the problem lies. However, he might not have discussed this with her to understand her approach before deciding to break up.\n\nSo, the key factors are: respecting her autonomy, the validity of his concerns about pseudoscience and its potential harm, the financial aspect, and whether this was a necessary break-up or an overreaction. If he couldn't find a middle ground and this was a deal-breaker, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's prioritizing his beliefs over her happiness and career without sufficient reason, he might be in the wrong. It's a tough call. The answer might hinge on whether the break-up was based on valid, non-discriminatory reasons or personal intolerance.\n"
