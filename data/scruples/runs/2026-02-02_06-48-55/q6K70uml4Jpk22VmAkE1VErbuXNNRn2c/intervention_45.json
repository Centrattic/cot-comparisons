Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user shared a situation where they broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience, like thinking vaccines cause autism and using homeopathy, which he considers disproven. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's problem is twofold: the girlfriend's career choice, which he sees as promoting pseudoscience, and the financial burden of her ND school. He loves her but feels their future plans are incompatible.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to breakups. But is this a valid reason? Well, the question is whether he's in the wrong for ending it over these issues. \n\nHe mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he ended the relationship because their visions differ. That's a bit contradictory. However, sometimes people can't reconcile core differences. The girlfriend's career choice is central here. If he can't accept her professional path due to ethical concerns (like potentially harming patients), that's a serious issue. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over someone's career and beliefs might seem harsh. But if those beliefs conflict with his values to the point of being a dealbreaker, maybe it's understandable. The financial aspect adds another layer. He might feel he can't afford the debt, which is a practical concern. \n\nHowever, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? The author feels guilty, which suggests he's conflicted. But if their core values are irreconcilably different, especially regarding something as serious as medical practices where lives are at stake, perhaps his decision isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut then again, in a healthy relationship, you work through disagreements. If he couldn't accept her career and beliefs, maybe ending it was the only option left. The key here is whether his reasons are valid. The girlfriend's beliefs could lead to harmful practices, which he finds unacceptable. If that's a dealbreaker for him, maybe he's not wrong for ending it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that love should overcome such differences. But when it comes to matters of health and ethics, it's a gray area. The author might have tried to address the issue and found no resolution, leading to the breakup. So, depending on the perspective, he could be in the right or wrong. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified. If he genuinely believes that her career could cause harm and that they can't agree, then his decision might be defensible. However, if he's prioritizing his own views over her and their relationship without sufficient dialogue, he could be in the wrong. The fact that he's feeling guilty and conflicted might indicate that he's unsure himself, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but I'm a bit split. The main points are about differing core values and the potential consequences of her career, which he can't accept. If he made a conscious decision after trying to reconcile, he might not be wrong.\n"
