Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she is going into ND, which he views as pseudoscience, especially regarding her beliefs about vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. He's upset about the financial burden of her school and the clash in their future visions. He mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views but about caring. However, he's conflicted because he feels he's ending a 10-year relationship over material issues.\n\nThe user provided the original Reddit-style post where the author is questioning if he's the asshole (AITA). The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if others agree.\n\nNow, to analyze whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are:\n\n1. **Disagreement over career choice and beliefs**: The author is against his girlfriend's career in ND due to his scientific views. However, her sister is already in the field, and she's committed to it. The author sees ND as pseudoscience and fears harm from it.\n\n2. **Financial concerns**: He's worried about supporting her through $200k in student debt. This financial aspect is a material reason for the breakup.\n\n3. **Values and love**: The author believes love should transcend such issues. However, he feels the differences are irreconcilable, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships often end because partners can't reconcile differences in core values. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending it over these reasons. \n\nSome might argue that career choices and financial responsibilities are valid reasons to end a relationship if they're incompatible. Others might say the author is dismissing her values and choices, which is where the conflict lies. The author's focus on pseudoscience and potential harm could be seen as valid concerns, especially if he's worried about her practicing something ineffective or dangerous. On the other hand, the financial burden is a significant factor, and if the author isn't willing to support that, it's a legitimate reason to part ways.\n\nBut then there's the emotional aspect. The author feels guilty, suggesting that maybe he's prioritizing his own values over the relationship. The user's own stance is that the author is in the wrong, perhaps because love should overcome differences. However, there's a point where irreconcilable differences make a relationship unsustainable.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), it's a bit nuanced. However, in the context of the AITA framework, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are justified given the circumstances. If the author's decision is based on valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the breakup is primarily due to not accepting her beliefs (which she's committed to), that could be seen as the problem. \n\nThe author's own feelings of guilt and the fact that friends and family say it shouldn't matter might indicate that his reasons are somewhat materialistic. Breaking up over career choice and differing views on science could be seen as a personal choice, but whether it's \"wrong\" depends on whether the reasons are sufficient. Since the author is conflicted and the breakup is causing him pain, it's a tough call. \n\nBut considering the options given (A or B), I think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial responsibilities, even if they are materialistic. However, there's a counterargument that he shouldn't impose his views on her career. \n\nAlternatively, if the relationship was built on mutual respect, but the author couldn't accept her career and its implications, then ending it isn't necessarily wrong. So, B might be the answer here.\n"
