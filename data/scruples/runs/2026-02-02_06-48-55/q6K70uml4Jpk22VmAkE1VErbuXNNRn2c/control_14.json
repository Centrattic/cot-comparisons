Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) with views they disagree with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up with their long-term girlfriend because she's committed to ND, which they see as pseudoscience. They mention issues with her beliefs (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) and financial concerns about her school debt. They feel bad about ending the relationship over these issues but also feel that their future visions are incompatible.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To answer this, I should consider the ethical aspects. The user wants a judgment based on the scenario. \n\nIn relationships, people often part ways over incompatible values. The author believes that modern medicine is essential and is concerned about their partner's career promoting what they see as pseudoscience, especially in treating serious conditions like cancer. They also mention financial issues. But love and relationships can be complex. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their partner's practices potentially harming patients, which is a valid ethical concern. They might feel they can't support someone whose work they believe is ineffective or dangerous. On the other hand, breaking up over this could be seen as dismissing someone's career choices and personal beliefs, especially if the partner is passionate about it. \n\nHowever, in this case, the author's main points are about differing worldviews and the financial burden. They also acknowledge that love shouldn't be about money or life views but feel their futures are incompatible. The girlfriend is set on her path, and the author can't reconcile that. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to end a relationship over such disagreements. Since the author isn't necessarily malicious but sees incompatibility, it's a tough call. But given that they've tried to justify their stance and it's about fundamental beliefs affecting their future together, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's wrong to end a relationship over such issues unless there's direct harm. \n\nWait, the author also mentions concerns about the ND's potential to harm patients by relying on pseudoscience. If the ND is providing treatments that could lead to worse outcomes for patients, that's a serious concern. The author might feel they can't support someone whose work they believe is dangerous. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's values is key. But when those values involve practices the other person deems harmful, it's a conflict. The author's stance is that they can't abide by practices they see as pseudoscience in a medical context, especially for serious illnesses. \n\nI think the author's decision is based on their ethical concerns about their partner's profession. However, it's also possible that they're overestimating the danger. NDs typically don't replace MDs but complement them. But the author's perspective is that they see it as promoting pseudoscience. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the severity of the issue. Since the breakup is about incompatible visions for the future and the author has specific ethical concerns, it's a valid reason for some. However, others might say that personal beliefs shouldn't override love. But the user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation. \n\nConsidering the author's concerns are about the partner's career promoting what they see as harmful practices, and they can't reconcile that, it's a matter of personal ethics. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're acting on their beliefs about what's right, even if others disagree. But some might argue A (in the wrong) because they ended a long-term relationship over this. However, the post says they tried to talk and couldn't resolve it. \n\nGiven the complexity, but the author's reasoning is based on ethical and practical concerns, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
