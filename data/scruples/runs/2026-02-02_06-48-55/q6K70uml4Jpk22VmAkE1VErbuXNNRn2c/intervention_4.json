Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs like linking vaccines to autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is upset that the breakup was over something material like money and school debt. They argue that love shouldn't be about money or life views but about care and feelings. However, their main concern is the girlfriend's career choice and her beliefs that conflict with their own, especially regarding pseudoscience and alternative medicine.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author broke up because of differing values (the girlfriend's career in ND with pseudoscience), financial burden of her education (around $200k), and the potential risks of her future work. The author feels conflicted because they loved the girlfriend a lot but can't reconcile these differences.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for values and life goals to be important. If two people have fundamental disagreements on significant issues like career paths and beliefs that affect their future together, it can be a valid reason to break up. The author didn't just leave because of the beliefs themselves but because he couldn't support the career choice due to financial reasons and the potential harm from pseudoscience. \n\nHowever, breaking up over someone's career and beliefs might be seen as harsh if the beliefs aren't directly affecting their life together. The author's focus on the financial aspect is a material reason, which they themselves feel is a materialistic basis for ending a long-term relationship. The conflict between their values and the material reason (money) is what they're struggling with.\n\nIn some perspectives, it's reasonable to part ways if core beliefs are irreconcilable. However, the way the author framed the breakup (focusing on money and pseudoscience) might be seen as prioritizing material concerns over love and support. The girlfriend's career choice is her right, even if he disagrees. The author might be in the wrong if they used financial pressure as a reason to end the relationship, especially in a long-term commitment where supporting each other's goals is expected.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the author truly can't support a career that they believe could be harmful, maybe that's a legitimate personal boundary. The question is whether it's the author's place to judge and end the relationship over that, especially when the girlfriend is following her own path. The author's feelings about pseudoscience might lead to conflict in the relationship, but that doesn't necessarily make the breakup wrong if they can't find a middle ground.\n\nSo, I'm a bit torn. The author's reasoning is based on their own values and concerns, which are valid to them. But the way they ended the relationship by focusing on financial support might be seen as inconsiderate. The key is whether the author's actions were justified in the context of their values versus the other person's autonomy. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I should consider if the breakup was too harsh or if the author's concerns were valid. The fact that the author is questioning their decision and feeling bad suggests they might have overreacted.\n"
