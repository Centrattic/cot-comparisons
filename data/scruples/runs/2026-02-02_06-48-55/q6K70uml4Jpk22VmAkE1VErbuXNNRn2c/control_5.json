Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is upset because he broke up with his girlfriend over her career choice and beliefs. He feels that love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but their future visions are conflicting. He's concerned about her going into a field he considers pseudoscientific and the financial burden of her education. However, he's also feeling guilty about ending a 10-year relationship over these issues.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships require compromise, but there are also points where fundamental differences might be deal-breakers. The key points here are the belief in pseudoscience and the financial aspect. The girlfriend is dead set on ND, which the author strongly disagrees with. He can't condone what he sees as harmful practices, especially if she might be giving up on modern medicine. On the other hand, breaking up over beliefs and career choices might be a personal choice, but is it justified?\n\nThe author mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet he's breaking up over these. That's a point against him. However, if he truly believes her career path is based on pseudoscience and could lead to harm (like not using proper medical treatment for cancer), that's a significant ethical concern. The financial aspect is also a practical issue\u2014supporting her education might be a big burden.\n\nBut is it his place to judge her career choice? People can choose different paths, even if others disagree. However, if the beliefs are causing a fundamental incompatibility in their future, maybe it's a valid reason. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his views over love.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. He's not forcing her to change her beliefs, but he can't accept them. In that case, maybe it's a matter of personal values clashing. However, breaking up over this might be seen as holding her accountable for views that, while harmful to him, are her personal and career choices. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect\u2014he's struggling with guilt, which suggests he's aware that this might not be the ideal reason to break up. His friends and family think it shouldn't matter, adding to his internal conflict. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the breakup is based on incompatible values and future plans, maybe not. But if it's more about imposing his views on her, then yes. The line between personal belief and respecting another's choice is thin here. The key is whether the author's reasons are valid for ending a relationship. If he can't see a future with her due to these differences, it's a personal decision, but it's also possible that he's using material reasons as an excuse for deeper disagreements. \n\nIn the end, it's complex. The author is in a tough spot, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, meaning he is wrong, it would be because he ended the relationship over her beliefs and financial reasons, which are personal choices. If B, then his decision is based on valid concerns about pseudoscience and practical issues, making it not his fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a tough decision based on his values and concerns about potential harm, even though it's painful. However, some might argue that he's wrong for not accepting her choices. But given the context of pseudoscience and possible harm, it's a valid concern. So, the answer is B.\n"
