Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he's against that because he thinks their views on medicine are too different. He's feeling guilty because he broke up over money and beliefs, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upset because his girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are not supported by science. He's okay with alternative medicine if it's effective but is against giving up modern medicine. He also mentions the financial burden of her ND school, which he might have to support. The breakup was because their visions for the future don't align, especially regarding her career choice.\n\nNow, in relationships, people have to compromise on various things like careers, money, life goals, etc. But when it comes to core values or beliefs that might affect each other's lives, there's a line. The author seems to think that the girlfriend's career is based on pseudoscience, which he finds dangerous, especially if she's working with cancer patients. That's a valid concern because promoting harmful misinformation could lead to real harm.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships are also about accepting each other's differences. If the author couldn't accept her career choice, even though he loves her, maybe that's a problem. He says love shouldn't be about money or views, but he's breaking up over those things. However, if her career choice leads to actions that contradict his values and he feels it's harmful, maybe it's a legitimate reason.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. He's concerned about taking on $200k in debt for her school. That's a significant financial burden, and if he felt he couldn't support that, it's a practical issue. But is that a fair reason to break up? It depends on whether it's about the debt or the underlying beliefs about her career.\n\nThe girlfriend's sister graduated from the same ND school, which might indicate a family commitment to this path. The author is worried that at best, the ND provides a placebo, but at worst, people die because they avoid conventional medicine. That's a serious concern. If the author believes that her work is actively harmful, maybe it's a deal-breaker because it conflicts with his values.\n\nBut is he overstepping by judging her career choice? If she's qualified and licensed, maybe he's being too critical. However, if he thinks her practices are based on pseudoscience and could harm others, it's more about safety and ethics.\n\nSo, the question is: Is breaking up over this justified? If the author's values are about protecting people from harm and he can't support someone working in a field he views as dangerous, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's dismissing her life choices without understanding or respecting her perspective, then he might be. However, given the potential for harm he's concerned about, maybe his decision is justified.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Considering the arguments, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the author is conflicted and feels guilty, but his reasons are about differing core values and potential harm, maybe he's not entirely wrong. The key is whether the breakup was the right decision given their incompatible values. Since relationships require mutual respect and the author can't accept her career's implications, maybe he's justified.\n"
