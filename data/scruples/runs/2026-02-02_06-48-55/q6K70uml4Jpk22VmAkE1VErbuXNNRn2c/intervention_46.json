Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs he disagrees with, like vaccines causing autism and pseudoscience. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't accept her career path and beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issues are differing values regarding medicine, financial concerns (student debt), and the author's inability to support her career despite loving her. The author justifies the breakup because of these differences but feels guilty for doing so over material things.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility in core values is important. If both partners can't agree on significant issues, it's a valid reason to part ways. The author mentions that their visions for the future are incompatible. The girlfriend is committed to her career, which the author sees as promoting pseudoscience that could harm patients. That's a serious concern, especially if she's intending to work with cancer patients, where evidence-based medicine is critical. The author's stance isn't just about money; it's about ethical and professional disagreements that could affect others' health.\n\nHowever, love and respect are foundational. The author does love her deeply but feels the differences are insurmountable. The financial aspect is a practical issue, but it's intertwined with his ethical objections. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough. He's in a dilemma between his love and his principles.\n\nOn one hand, breaking up over such issues might seem harsh, but if one's career involves practices the other finds harmful, it's a legitimate conflict. The author isn't just opposing her career for financial reasons; he's against the underlying beliefs that could lead to dangerous misinformation. The girlfriend's commitment to this path despite his concerns might mean she's unwilling to compromise, making the relationship untenable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he truly believes her career could harm others and she's not willing to budge, his decision might be based on ethical grounds. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this could also be seen as prioritizing his values over their bond. It's a tough call. In AITA contexts, the community often considers whether the action was justified given the circumstances. Here, the author's reasons are both financial and ethical, which are significant. However, the emotional aspect and the length of the relationship add complexity.\n\nI think the author is justified in his decision because the core values and potential harm from her career path are deal-breakers for him. But he also feels conflicted, which is understandable. The answer might depend on whether the breakup was the right choice given their irreconcilable differences. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
