Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The writer feels conflicted, believing that love shouldn't be about money or views on life, yet he ended the relationship over her career choice and financial burden.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's career path, specifically her belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism, which are debunked. He also mentions the financial aspect of her ND school debt and his unwillingness to support that. On the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her path, and he feels torn between his love for her and his disagreements.\n\nThe key points here are: differing values regarding science and medicine, financial implications, and whether these are valid reasons to end a long-term relationship. The author is struggling with guilt, feeling that love should transcend these issues but ultimately made the decision based on his principles.\n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, compatibility in core values is important. If one partner's career and beliefs fundamentally contradict the other's, especially regarding health practices that could impact patient outcomes (as the author fears with NDs treating cancer patients), that's a significant issue. The financial burden is also a practical concern. However, breaking up over these reasons might be seen as prioritizing personal beliefs over the relationship, which could be viewed as harsh if the other person isn't willing to compromise.\n\nBut relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the author couldn't reconcile their differences despite efforts, and if the girlfriend was equally committed to her path without acknowledging his concerns, then the breakup might be justified. The author's stance on pseudoscience versus evidence-based medicine is a matter of health and safety, which is a serious issue. However, using financial support as a reason might be more about personal limits than the core issue of her career.\n\nIt's possible that the author is not entirely in the wrong if he felt that their fundamental disagreements were irreconcilable. However, the way he framed the breakup, emphasizing money over her career choice, might indicate that other factors could have been addressed with communication. Yet, the deeper issue is the conflict over scientific beliefs, which can affect real-life decisions and ethics in her profession. If he's concerned about her providing harmful advice, that's a valid ethical concern.\n\nOn the flip side, love and relationships often require compromise. The author might have expected her to reconsider her path or for him to accept it. Since the breakup was due to these factors, it's a personal decision, but whether it's right or wrong depends on perspective. The question is whether his reasons are justifiable. If he believes in evidence-based medicine and cannot support a career that he sees as pseudoscientific, especially in a sensitive area like cancer treatment, his decision could be seen as based on his principles. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this might be seen as extreme if there was no attempt to find middle ground.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are valid enough to justify ending the relationship. If the core values are irreconcilable and pose ethical concerns, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if the breakup was primarily due to financial reasons and secondary to her career choice, there could be room for criticism. The author's emphasis on pseudoscience and potential harm to patients adds weight to his position, making it a complex ethical dilemma.\n"
