Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds certain beliefs about alternative medicine and pseudoscience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been in a 10-year relationship. He broke up with her because she's committed to attending ND school, which he views as promoting pseudoscience like the idea that vaccines cause autism and homeopathy. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k debt for a 4-year program, which he would have supported. He feels conflicted because he loves her a lot but can't support her career choice due to his beliefs in modern medicine.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key factors: \n\n1. **Differences in Values**: The author is upset because he sees ND as pseudoscience and a potential danger to patients (like giving a placebo to someone with cancer). The girlfriend is passionate about her career choice. In relationships, differing core values can lead to conflict. But is it valid to break up over this?\n\n2. **Love and Material Issues**: The author mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he ended the relationship over financial and career differences. He feels it's wrong because he loved her a lot, but maybe he's prioritizing his beliefs over the relationship.\n\n3. **Communication and Compromise**: Did they discuss this issue before? The post mentions an argument where money was a factor. If they couldn't find a middle ground, maybe the breakup is a result of irreconcilable differences. However, is it fair to break up based on career choice, especially if it's deeply personal to her?\n\n4. **Ethical Concerns**: The author is worried that her future work might harm patients. If he genuinely believes she's endangering people, is he justified in ending the relationship? On the other hand, he acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative, so maybe it's more about her specific approach rather than the field in general.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The author is feeling guilty and hurt. He recognizes that others told him it shouldn't matter, but he still made the choice. His emotional state might influence his judgment, but the question is whether his actions were justified.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal values with respect for the partner's choices. If the career choice is a fundamental part of her identity and the author can't accept it, then maybe it's a deal-breaker. However, if the issue is about differing beliefs without mutual respect, that's problematic. The author seems to respect her work in some ways (like using turmeric for bruises) but not when it comes to serious illnesses. This inconsistency might be an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if he truly believes that her work could harm patients, especially in life-threatening situations, he might feel it's necessary to end the relationship to stay true to his ethical standards. But is that a valid reason? It's a heavy decision and could be seen as being in the wrong if he's dismissing her life goals without compromise.\n\nI think there's a middle ground here. The author might have valid concerns about pseudoscience, but using those concerns to end a long-term relationship solely on his terms without finding a compromise could be seen as his fault. However, if he couldn't see a future where they could respect each other's views, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The key is whether he acted out of genuine ethical concerns or if his reaction was disproportionate.\n"
