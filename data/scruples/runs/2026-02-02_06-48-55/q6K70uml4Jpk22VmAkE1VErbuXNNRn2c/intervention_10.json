Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's pursuing a career as a Naturopathic Doctor, which he views as pseudoscience. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points he made. He mentions their visions for the future are different, especially regarding her belief in alternative medicine, including things like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He's worried about her going into a field he thinks is based on pseudoscience, which could be harmful if people rely on NDs instead of medical doctors, especially for serious conditions like cancer. He also brings up financial concerns about her 200k debt for ND school, which he'd have to support. But he feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or beliefs.\n\nNow, thinking about whether he's in the wrong. Relationships often end over differing values or life goals. The question is whether his reasons are valid. On one hand, his concern about pseudoscience and potential harm is a legitimate ethical concern, especially if patients rely on unproven treatments instead of evidence-based medicine. However, he acknowledges that NDs can have a place as an alternative. The financial aspect is another point\u2014supporting a partner's education is a big commitment, but maybe the real issue is their differing core beliefs rather than the debt itself.\n\nBut is it fair to break up over beliefs that are part of her career choice? If she's committed to this path and he can't accept it as valid, that's a fundamental difference. However, he also mentions they had a 10-year relationship, so maybe they've had time to discuss these issues. The key is whether the break-up is about irreconcilable differences or if he's imposing his views on her. Since he's the one who ended the relationship, it's possible he's prioritizing his values over hers, which could be seen as selfish if he can't accept her for who she is. \n\nHe also feels guilty for using money as a reason, but it's possible his deeper issue is the pseudoscience aspect. The question is whether it's a matter of respecting each other's choices. If she's choosing a career path he fundamentally disagrees with, but he can't accept that without judgment, then maybe the relationship wasn't compatible. However, the severity of the issue\u2014pseudoscience in medicine\u2014might be a valid concern for him. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not compromising or for letting external factors (like family opinions) influence their decisions. But in this case, he's torn between his love for her and his beliefs. It's a tough spot. The answer might depend on whether the pseudoscientific beliefs are a deal-breaker for him, which they are. If he's not willing to support her in her chosen career, maybe it's not fair of him to end the relationship over it, but if it's a core value for him, then it's a legitimate reason. \n\nBut since he's the one who ended it, and he's expressing guilt, maybe he's being too hard on himself. However, the community might see it as him not accepting her for who she is. The main point is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his values over her career choice. Given the potential harm he's concerned about (like patients dying because they rely on NDs instead of MDs), some might argue his stance is valid. Others might say it's not his place to judge her career, and the breakup is a result of not being able to accept her. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards A (he is in the wrong) because the breakup is over her career choice, which is a personal decision she's committed to, and he's using his belief about pseudoscience as a reason to end the relationship. However, there's a counterpoint about the potential harm of her profession. But since NDs do have a place and she's going into working with cancer patients, which is a sensitive area, his concerns are valid but maybe he's overstepping. \n\nWait, but in the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable. If he's ending a long-term relationship over differing beliefs, even if those beliefs are about science, it might be seen as his choice, but is he in the wrong? If he can't accept her for who she is, then maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if he feels that her career is based on pseudoscience and he can't support that, it's a valid reason. \n\nThe community's response might split, but generally, in AITA threads, ending a relationship over deeply held values can be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. However, if the person is pressuring the other to change their career, that's different. Since he's the one who ended it because he can't accept her career, it's his decision. But is he wrong for doing so? It's a matter of perspective. If he can't accept her for who she is, then maybe it's not his fault for ending the relationship. But if he's using his beliefs to end a long-term relationship without finding a compromise, then he might be at fault. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The key is whether the break-up was about respecting her choices. Since he's the one who ended it, and he's the one who can't accept her beliefs, the community might say he's not in the wrong because it's his right to end the relationship if he can't support her. But others might say he should have found another way to handle the differences. However, the fact that he's expressing so much guilt suggests he's conflicted, which is common in AITA posts. \n\nI think the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's allowing his beliefs about her career to override his love for her, and the breakup is over something that should be a personal choice. But the other side is that his values are important. However, in a loving relationship, accepting each other's flaws and choices is part of it. So if he can't accept her career, maybe it's a valid reason to end it, but the guilt he's feeling indicates he might be overreacting. \n\nFinal thought: The author's reasons are valid concerns, but if he can't accept her for who she is, then the relationship might not be viable. However, ending it over her career choice might be seen as him not accepting her. Given the AITA context, the community might say he's at fault because he's prioritizing his beliefs over the relationship without trying to find middle ground. But I'm still a bit torn. If the pseudoscience aspect is a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's not wrong. But since NDs do exist and she's choosing that path, it's her right. So the answer could be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
