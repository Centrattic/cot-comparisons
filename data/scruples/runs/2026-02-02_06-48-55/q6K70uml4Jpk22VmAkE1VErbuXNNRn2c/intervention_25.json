Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and they disagree with her views on pseudoscience like vaccinations and homeopathy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author believes that their girlfriend is pursuing a field that relies on pseudoscience and could potentially harm patients if they recommend treatments that don't work. They also mention financial concerns about her attending a 4-year ND school with $200k debt, which they would have to support. The author feels conflicted, loving her deeply but not being able to support her career choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her path, and the author's main issue seems to be both the financial burden and the disagreement on medical practices. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this impartially.\n\nBreaking up over differing values isn't uncommon. In relationships, when core values clash, especially ones that affect each other's lives significantly, it can lead to a breakup. Here, the author is concerned about the validity of the career path (NDs and pseudoscience) and the financial aspect. However, the girlfriend might see her career as a calling and feel that the author isn't supporting her ambitions.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Disagreement on the legitimacy of her career field (ND vs MD), 2) Concerns about pseudoscience and potential harm, 3) Financial burden of her education.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to consider if the breakup was primarily about non-negotiable differences. While it's true that love should ideally transcend material issues, when values are fundamentally incompatible, it's hard to sustain a relationship. The author might feel that their partner's career could lead to harmful practices, which is a valid concern from a medical ethics standpoint. However, breaking up over this might be seen as prioritizing one's beliefs over the relationship. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of financial support. If the author is not willing to support the debt, that's a practical issue. However, the main emotional weight here is the disagreement on the career path's validity. The author might not be wrong if they feel the relationship can't survive such a fundamental disagreement. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's career is her passion and she's not violating any ethical standards (even if the author disagrees), the author's stance could be seen as judgmental.\n\nIn the AITA context, people might argue both sides. Some might say the author is right to prioritize their values, others might say they're wrong for focusing on material and ideological differences over love. The author's own guilt suggests internal conflict. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be the asshole if they genuinely believe the career path is harmful and they can't support that. However, the way the breakup was handled, especially citing financial support as the main issue when the underlying issue is about career choice, might be seen as a cop-out. Alternatively, if the financial support is a legitimate concern, it's a valid reason.\n\nBut the core issue is the disagreement on medical practices. The author's stance is that pseudoscience is dangerous, which is a valid concern. However, relationships often require compromise. If the girlfriend's career is her passion and she's not using it to harm others (assuming she's within legal/ethical boundaries), the author's decision to break up might be harsh. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether the author's values are non-negotiable and if the breakup was a necessary step given those values. If the author couldn't support a partner in a career they fundamentally disagree with, it's a personal choice. However, the AITA community often looks for whether the person acted unreasonably. The author might be seen as in the right if they're protecting their ethical stance, but others might argue they're wrong for ending a long-term relationship over this. Considering the financial aspect and the emotional impact, the answer isn't clear-cut. The author's guilt also suggests they feel conflicted, which is a sign they might be overthinking it.\n"
