Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and has beliefs that the author considers pseudoscientific. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their breakup was due to differing views on medicine and financial concerns. He feels guilty because he thought love shouldn't be about money or beliefs but about care and love. However, he can't reconcile his belief in modern medicine with her commitment to ND practices, which he sees as pseudoscience. The financial aspect\u2014$200k debt for ND school\u2014is also a factor he brings up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, ending a relationship over such issues can be seen as prioritizing personal values and future incompatibility. If one partner's career path and beliefs conflict with the other's, especially on something as critical as healthcare, that could lead to long-term issues. The author is concerned about potential harm if the ND practices ineffective treatments, which is a valid concern, especially regarding serious illnesses like cancer. The financial burden is another practical aspect; supporting such a debt might be a significant strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is feeling guilty because he values love and care. Ending a relationship over disagreements might seem harsh, especially if the breakup is framed around money and career. The girlfriend's choice of career is a personal decision, and while the author disagrees, it's her right to pursue it. However, the author's stance is that pseudoscience could lead to harm, which is a moral concern. \n\nBut is it the author's place to dictate her career? That's a tricky point. While he has the right to his beliefs, enforcing them in a relationship can be seen as controlling. However, if the beliefs lead to practices that could endanger others, it's a matter of ethics. \n\nThe key here is whether the breakup is justified. Incompatibility in core values, especially when it affects future plans and ethical concerns, can be a legitimate reason for a breakup. However, using financial reasons as the main point might be a sensitive issue. The author is also questioning his decision, which adds complexity. \n\nIn many cases, relationships end when partners realize their future visions are incompatible. The author's decision isn't malicious; he's prioritizing his values and concerns about safety and debt. However, some might argue that love should overcome such differences if both parties are committed to understanding each other. Yet, when it comes to health beliefs, which can have real-world consequences, the line between personal choice and potential harm is thin.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a tough decision based on his beliefs and future concerns. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the breakup is due to incompatible values and practical concerns, which are legitimate in a relationship.\n"
