Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The main points the author brings up are differing views on science-based medicine versus alternative medicine, financial concerns about her ND school debt, and the fear that her career might lead to harm by promoting pseudoscience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's reasons. They mention that the girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like the autism-vaccine link and homeopathy, which are debunked by science. The author is concerned that as an ND, she might provide ineffective or harmful treatments. That's a valid concern, especially if the ND practices in a way that could endanger patients, like advising against conventional treatments for serious conditions. However, ND programs vary, and some might integrate with conventional medicine. The author's fear might be based on stereotypes about NDs rather than the reality of what she'll do.\n\nFinancially, the author is worried about supporting her through $200k in school debt. That's a significant financial burden, and if the author was not willing to take on that responsibility, it's a practical concern. However, relationships often involve shared financial decisions, so this could be a legitimate issue if they had discussed and agreed on financial responsibilities. If they hadn't, maybe the author should have communicated that earlier.\n\nLove and values are another angle. The author says love shouldn't be about money or worldview, but they broke up over these differences. While it's true that love should transcend materialism, people also need compatibility in core values. If the author views the girlfriend's career choice as fundamentally incompatible with their values (like evidence-based medicine), that might be a deal-breaker. However, the author also mentions they understand the overprescription issue and accept alternative medicine that works. So maybe the real issue is the fear of her promoting harmful pseudoscience, not just her career choice.\n\nThe emotional aspect is that the author feels wrong to end a 10-year relationship over this. They're hurting and question their decision. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, which might suggest the author has some prior exposure but still disagrees. The author's sister's experience doesn't change their concern if they believe it's harmful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, breaking up is a personal choice. But was it the right choice? The author might be in the right if they feel the relationship can't overcome these core differences. However, if the breakup was rushed or not properly communicated, maybe they're in the wrong. The key is whether the author gave the relationship a fair chance to address these issues through communication or compromise. If the author broke up without trying to understand or resolve differences, that could be the issue. But if they've tried and found it irreconcilable, it's more about compatibility than being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the author's tone shows they're conflicted, which is understandable. They care deeply but feel the need to end it. The question is whether the reasons for the breakup are valid. If the author can't support the girlfriend's career due to ethical concerns, that's a personal right. However, if the breakup is more about control or not accepting her choices, that's another matter. The author's reasoning seems to stem from genuine concern for patients and financial compatibility, which are valid reasons, even if others might disagree.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision is based on their values and concerns. Whether they're in the wrong depends on if they acted unreasonably or without trying to resolve the issues. Since they acknowledge their feelings of guilt and have discussed it with friends and family, maybe they've considered other perspectives. The final answer might be that they're not in the wrong, as they made a difficult decision based on their beliefs and circumstances.\n"
