Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the breakup post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor, which he opposes due to her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their future visions differ.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values modern medicine and is against pseudoscience. His girlfriend is committed to ND, which he sees as potentially harmful. He mentions financial burden as a factor too. But he's conflicted because he loves her.\n\nIn relationships, dealing with fundamental differences in values is a common issue. The question is whether his reasons are valid. On one hand, choosing a career path is a personal decision, and love should ideally accept each other's choices. On the other hand, if one partner's career involves beliefs that the other finds ethically problematic (like endorsing harmful practices), that's a serious concern.\n\nThe financial aspect adds another layer. Supporting a $200k debt isn't trivial. If the author felt he couldn't take on that responsibility, that's a practical reason. But breaking up over it might be seen as prioritizing material concerns over emotional commitment. However, if the career path itself is a deal-breaker because of core beliefs, it's a different story.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests he's aware that material reasons shouldn't be the primary factor. But his values about medical practices are clashing with hers. If she's set on a career that he views as promoting pseudoscience, which could lead to harmful practices (like advising against vaccines), that's a significant ethical issue for him.\n\nIt's a tough call. The breakup is sad, but if he can't reconcile his beliefs about medical science with her career, maybe it's a valid reason. However, breaking up over money and career choices can be seen as materialistic. Still, when those choices involve beliefs that could affect others' health, it's a more complex moral issue.\n\nSo, balancing the ethical concerns against the emotional and financial factors, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. His decision is painful but based on conflicting values that are hard to compromise on. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not ignoring the materialistic aspect. However, given the potential consequences of her career beliefs, his stance might be defensible.\n"
