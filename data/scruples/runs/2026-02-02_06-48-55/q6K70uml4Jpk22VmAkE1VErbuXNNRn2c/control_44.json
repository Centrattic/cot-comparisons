Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and they disagree with her beliefs in pseudoscience. The main points are about differing views on alternative medicine versus modern medicine and financial concerns about her school debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for the breakup. The author values scientific evidence and is worried about her beliefs leading to harmful outcomes, like not treating serious illnesses properly. They also mention the financial burden of her education. But they also express feeling guilty for breaking up over these material issues.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships often involve accepting differences. But when it comes to core beliefs, especially those that might affect health decisions, it's a gray area. The girlfriend's career choice isn't just a personal preference; it's a profession that could influence patient care. If the author believes she's promoting pseudoscience that could harm others, that's a significant ethical concern. However, breaking up over this might be seen as prioritizing personal values over the relationship, which could be justified if they can't compromise.\n\nThe financial aspect adds another layer. Taking on $200k debt is a big commitment. The author might feel it's irresponsible, especially if they believe her career path isn't as reputable. But is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? Maybe they should have discussed it earlier and found a solution instead of breaking up.\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but the author still feels conflicted. It's possible they're right to break up if the fundamental values clash beyond just money. However, using financial support as the main reason might be a way to rationalize a deeper issue. Also, the fact that the girlfriend's sister is in the same field and they still think it's harmful could indicate a lack of willingness to understand each other's perspectives.\n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether personal values about healthcare ethics and financial responsibility justify ending a long-term relationship. If the author couldn't accept her career and beliefs without conflict, then the breakup might be necessary for their own well-being, but it's a tough call. The answer might be B because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if their values are non-negotiable, but A if they should have worked through the issues.\n"
