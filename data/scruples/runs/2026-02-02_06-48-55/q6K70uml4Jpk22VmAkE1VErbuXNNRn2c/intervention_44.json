Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author mentions that they broke up because his girlfriend is going into ND school and believes in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy. He feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views but he can't reconcile their differing visions for the future. He also brings up the financial aspect of her student debt and the risk of her relying on pseudoscience, potentially harming patients. He's upset because he feels like a jerk for ending a 10-year relationship over such material things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether it's reasonable for the author to base the breakup on his partner's career choice and beliefs. Relationships often require compromise, but when there's a fundamental disagreement on important issues, that can be a deal-breaker. The key points here are the belief in pseudoscience (like anti-vaxxer views) and the financial burden of ND school.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about her career path leading to harmful practices. If the girlfriend is dead set on a field that the author sees as pseudoscientific and potentially dangerous, that could lead to long-term conflict. The author might feel that their core values are incompatible. For example, if she's treating cancer patients with unproven methods instead of evidence-based medicine, that could be a serious ethical issue for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is ending a long-term relationship over these issues. It's possible that they could have worked through these differences with communication and mutual respect. The financial aspect is also a practical concern, but using that as the main reason could be seen as materialistic, as he acknowledges. However, his underlying issue is the belief in pseudoscience, which might be a deeper incompatibility.\n\nAnother angle is whether the beliefs she holds are truly as harmful as he thinks. While he views her beliefs as pseudoscience, she might see her work as a holistic approach that complements modern medicine. The author mentions he thinks NDs have a place as an alternative, so maybe the issue is her absolute stance against modern medicine rather than the field itself.\n\nThe author also feels that love should transcend these issues, but in reality, people do break up over incompatible values. If both partners can't find a middle ground, it's a legitimate reason to end the relationship. However, if the breakup is more about his inability to accept her beliefs rather than her actions (like actually practicing harmful methods), that might be different.\n\nI should also consider the emotional impact. The author is clearly hurting, but so is the girlfriend. The question is whether the breakup is justified given the reasons. The author's main points are about ethics and incompatibility in values, which are significant in a lasting relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the reasons for the breakup are valid. If their core values and beliefs are fundamentally incompatible, then it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship. However, if the breakup is based on his personal biases against naturopathy without considering her perspective or potential for compromise, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he's conflicted but feels it's necessary suggests it's a tough call. But given the potential for harm in her future practices from his viewpoint, he might be justified, hence not in the wrong.\n"
