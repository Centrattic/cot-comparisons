Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds certain beliefs about alternative medicine. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he values love and caring for someone, but their visions for the future are conflicting. The main issues seem to be about her career choice, her beliefs in pseudoscience (like the vaccination-autism link and homeopathy), and the financial burden of her ND school, which he would have to support.\n\nHe feels guilty about breaking up over money and career, thinking love shouldn't be about that. But he also can't reconcile her beliefs with his own, especially when it comes to trusting modern medicine. He acknowledges that some alternative medicine might have a place as complementary, but he's against abandoning modern practices entirely. The concern is that her work might lead to harmful outcomes if patients rely on ND instead of MDs, especially for serious illnesses like cancer.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, relationships often require compromise, and using science-based reasoning to make decisions is valid. However, breaking up solely because of career choice and beliefs might be seen as judgmental. But the financial aspect adds another layer\u2014supporting a $200k degree could be a huge commitment, and if he's not willing to take that on, it's a practical issue.\n\nThe ethical angle is tricky. If he genuinely believes that her work could be harmful, is it responsible to be in a relationship with her? Or is it his right to walk away from a conflict he can't resolve? Also, their 10-year relationship suggests deep feelings, but if core values are irreconcilable, maybe the breakup is inevitable.\n\nIn terms of the wrongness, if the author is making a decision based on his own values and the potential risks he's uncomfortable with, it's not necessarily wrong. But if he's dismissing her choices without understanding her perspective or if the breakup is more about his own biases than actual harm, then he might be in the wrong. The guilt he's feeling shows internal conflict, but the decision itself might be valid given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The decision is tough, but it's based on conflicting values and practical concerns, not just trivial matters.\n"
