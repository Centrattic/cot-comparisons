Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and linking vaccines to autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author loves his girlfriend but can't support her career choice because he thinks ND practices are pseudoscientific and dangerous. He also mentions financial concerns about the $200k debt for her school. The breakup happened because their visions for the future differ, especially regarding her field of study.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, love is supposed to accept each other's differences. If their core values are conflicting, like their views on medicine, that could be a deal-breaker. The author is worried about her future work potentially harming patients by relying on unproven methods. That's a serious concern, especially if she's working with cancer patients. The financial aspect is another factor\u2014supporting a partner through expensive school is a big commitment, and if he's not willing to take on that debt, that's a valid personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this seems harsh. The girlfriend's career choice is her own, and while he disagrees with her beliefs, that's her right. He could have tried to communicate and find a middle ground instead of ending the relationship. The fact that her sister already graduated and the girlfriend is \"dead set\" on it suggests she's made her decision, which might not be negotiable. The author's feelings are valid, but is it right to break up over something that's about her career and beliefs?\n\nI think the key points are: differing core values, potential harm from her profession, and financial commitment. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm is a serious ethical issue. However, love and relationships can sometimes require compromise. If the author couldn't reconcile his beliefs with her career, maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible values. But is that enough to say he's in the wrong? Or is it that he's making a tough choice based on his own principles?\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his decision is based on his own values and concerns about her future profession's validity and safety. However, it's a close call. The alternative view is that he's using money and beliefs as an excuse to end a long-term relationship. But the emotional impact on him is real, and he's struggling with it, which complicates things. The answer might depend on whether one views career and belief differences as sufficient grounds for a breakup. I think in this case, the author's reasons are valid enough that he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
