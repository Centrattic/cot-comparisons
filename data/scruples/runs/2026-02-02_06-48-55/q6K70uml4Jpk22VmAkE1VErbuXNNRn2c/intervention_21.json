Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The main issues they mention are her belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy) and the financial burden of her ND school, which would lead to $200k debt. The author feels bad about ending the relationship over these reasons but thinks their views on medicine are fundamentally different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's valid for the author to break up over differing beliefs. Relationships can be difficult when core values clash. The author believes in modern medicine and is against pseudoscientific practices. The girlfriend is committed to a field that the author sees as potentially harmful, especially in cases where patients might forgo MD advice. That's a serious concern. However, love and relationships are also about acceptance. If the author can't accept her career and beliefs, even if they're wrong in their view, is that a dealbreaker?\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author mentions supporting her through school debt. That's a big financial commitment. If the author isn't willing to take on that debt, it's a practical reason for breaking up. But is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over financial disagreements? Maybe if the debt is a significant burden and the author isn't comfortable with it, but they should have discussed this earlier.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they think love shouldn't be about money or life views. But they also believe their views on medicine are important. There's a conflict between personal beliefs and relationship values. The author might be right in their scientific stance, but relationships often require compromise. If the girlfriend isn't willing to consider modern medicine, and the author can't accept her career path, maybe the break-up is inevitable. However, is it the author's fault for prioritizing their own views over love?\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's commitment to her field despite the author's concerns. She might see her work as helping people through alternative means, even if others disagree. The author's fear is about potential harm, but that's a value judgment. The question is whether it's right to end a relationship because of a disagreement on career and beliefs, even if those beliefs are questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's family and friends say it shouldn't matter. They might be emphasizing acceptance, but the author's values are about health and safety. The key here is whether the disagreement is about something that's deal-breaking. If the author can't support someone who might be providing ineffective treatments, even if it's a personal choice, then maybe the break-up is justified from their perspective.\n\nIn summary, the author is conflicted between personal values and the relationship. They might not be in the wrong because they're standing by their beliefs about medical science and financial responsibility. However, it's a tough call because relationships require compromise. The author's actions are based on their values, but they feel conflicted, which adds complexity. The answer might hinge on whether the break-up was necessary given the deep differences in core values.\n"
