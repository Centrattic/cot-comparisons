Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a naturopathic doctor. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The breakup was due to differing views on medicine. The author is against the pseudoscientific aspects of naturopathy, especially regarding homeopathy and the belief that vaccines cause autism. He's concerned about her going into a field he views as potentially harmful, particularly for cancer patients. Additionally, there's the financial burden of her education and the idea that he'd have to support her through it.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because he loves her deeply but can't reconcile his beliefs with her career choice. He mentions feeling like a bad person for ending things over money and career differences. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with his decision.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Relationships often involve compromise, but there are points where values and beliefs can be deal-breakers. The key issues here are the disagreement over pseudoscience in her career and financial responsibilities. \n\nIf the author's main concern is that her beliefs could lead to harmful practices (like not using modern medicine for serious illnesses), that's a valid ethical concern. However, love and relationships are personal, and it's not necessarily his place to decide her career path unless it directly harms him. But if her work could harm others, that's a different angle. However, the text mentions she works with cancer patients, which is a serious issue if she's promoting pseudoscience there.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. The $200k debt is a significant burden. If he's unwilling to support her through that, it's a practical reason. But it's also a materialistic reason, which he feels bad about. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's making a decision based on his values and potential risks. On the other, ending a 10-year relationship over these issues might be seen as prioritizing personal beliefs over love. However, if he genuinely cannot support her career due to ethical concerns, maybe it's a legitimate reason. \n\nIt's tricky because there's no right or wrong in relationships; it's subjective. But if the breakup is primarily over her career choice and the author's ethical stance against her practices, he might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the way he framed his reasons (money and pseudoscience) could be seen as materialistic. But if he believes that her career involves harmful practices, he might feel it's necessary to part ways to avoid being complicit. \n\nAlternatively, if he could have tried to understand her perspective or found a middle ground, maybe he's in the wrong for not compromising. But the text suggests they had a significant argument that led to the breakup, indicating a breakdown in communication or alignment of values. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is acting based on his values and concerns about her career's potential harm, which he can't support. However, others might see it as him prioritizing his beliefs over love, but the question is whether he's objectively in the wrong, which is subjective. Given the ethical concerns, maybe B is correct.\n"
