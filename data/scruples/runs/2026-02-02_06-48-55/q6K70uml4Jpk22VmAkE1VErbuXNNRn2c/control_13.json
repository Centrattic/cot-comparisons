Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if breaking up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) makes them the \"asshat.\" The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author broke up because they disagree with the girlfriend's career choice. She wants to be an ND, which he sees as pseudoscience, especially regarding homeopathy and vaccination beliefs. He mentions she's set on this path despite scientific evidence against some of her views. He also brings up financial issues\u2014$200k in debt for ND school, which he wouldn't support. \n\nHe feels conflicted because he loves her a lot but can't reconcile their differing views on medicine. He's hurting because the breakup is over material things and money, not just love. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with his decision.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships: relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and values. If core values are irreconcilable, it's hard to sustain a relationship. But is the author wrong for breaking up over this? He's concerned about her future career's impact, especially if she might harm patients by relying on pseudoscience. However, he also acknowledges that NDs can have a place as an alternative, just not as a replacement for modern medicine.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Disagreement over scientific views (vaccines, homeopathy).\n2. Financial burden and willingness to support her education.\n3. Whether these are valid reasons to break up.\n\nOn one hand, respecting someone's career choice is important. She has her own beliefs and path. If he can't accept that, maybe he's projecting his values onto her. On the other hand, if he's worried about her career leading to harm (like patients not seeking proper MD care), that's a legitimate concern, especially in serious illnesses like cancer. But how much should personal beliefs affect a relationship?\n\nFinancial support is another angle. If the debt is a significant issue and he's unwilling to take on that responsibility, that's a practical concern. However, using money as the main reason to break up when the core issue is the career choice might complicate things. He feels it's not just money but the career path itself that's incompatible.\n\nIs it wrong to break up over incompatible values? It's debatable. Relationships require compromise, but if the values are fundamental (like views on science and health), it's hard. However, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive of her aspirations and beliefs. He might not be respecting her autonomy in choosing her career, even if he disagrees with it.\n\nAlso, he says love should not be about money or views on life, yet his break up is based on those exact things. That's a contradiction he's aware of. The question is whether these are valid reasons. If he can't accept her for who she is, including her career, then maybe the breakup is inevitable. But is it his fault? He's acting on his beliefs, but maybe he didn't try hard enough to find a middle ground.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is influenced by both financial and ideological differences. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether those reasons are sufficient for a breakup. If the relationship couldn't adapt to these differences, then it's not necessarily his fault. But if he's not respecting her choices and imposing his views, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he's conflicted and hurting shows he cares, but the decision to end it over these issues might still be seen as valid from his perspective.\n"
