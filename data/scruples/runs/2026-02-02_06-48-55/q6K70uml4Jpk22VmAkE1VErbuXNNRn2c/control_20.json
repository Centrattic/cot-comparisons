Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to disagreements over pseudoscience and financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author broke up because of differences in views on medicine. He believes that NDs use pseudoscience, like homeopathy, which he thinks is unscientific. He's worried about the debt from her ND school and the potential risks of relying on alternative medicine instead of modern practices. However, he also acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative and that he cares deeply for her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Relationships often require compromise, but there are cases where core values clash. Here, the author is concerned about his partner's beliefs potentially leading to harmful practices, especially with cancer patients. If she's going into a field that he believes could be dangerous, that's a significant issue. He's not just against the career choice but the underlying principles he thinks could harm others.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his decision is based on his views about her career, which could be seen as judgmental. The breakup is based on differing worldviews, which are personal and subjective. However, if her career path involves promoting practices that could endanger health, it's a matter of ethics and safety. The financial aspect adds another layer, as he's unwilling to support her education, leading to the split.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are valid. If he believes supporting a career with potentially harmful practices is against his values, he might feel justified. But if the disagreement is more about personal beliefs rather than actual harm, the breakup might be seen as premature. However, given the explicit mention of pseudoscience and the risks involved, some might side with the author. Still, others might say love should overcome such differences.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author is not wrong for valuing scientific integrity and safety, but is it wrong to end a relationship over that? It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives on relationships and personal ethics. Given that the user is asking for AITA, the community's response might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are about safety and ethics, which are significant. However, breaking up over such issues can be seen as harsh. But the alternative is staying in a relationship with potentially harmful beliefs, which he can't support.\n"
