Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main points are: the breakup was due to differing views on alternative medicine and the financial burden of ND school. The author feels conflicted, acknowledging that love shouldn't be about money or life views but still broke up over these issues.\n\nI should consider factors like whether the reasons for the breakup are valid. The girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) is a red flag. If she's planning to work with cancer patients, her stance could potentially be harmful. However, the author's main argument is about conflicting future visions and the financial commitment.\n\nIn relationships, major differences in career paths and financial responsibilities can be significant. The author felt that supporting her through $200k in debt for a four-year program wasn't feasible, which is a practical concern. But the pseudoscientific beliefs complicate things. If the author can't accept her career choice because it's based on misinformation, especially in a field that could affect others' health, that's a deeper issue.\n\nThe author might feel justified in prioritizing their values and future. However, breaking up over this could be seen as using materialistic reasons (money) to end a long-term relationship, which the author himself acknowledges as wrong. But the core issue is the irreconcilable differences in their views on science and medicine, which might affect their compatibility in the long run.\n\nAlso, the author's friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but his own feelings indicate that it does. The question is whether the pseudoscientific beliefs are a deal-breaker. In some cases, people have limits on what they can accept in a partner. If the author can't support someone who might promote harmful practices, even if the beliefs aren't directly causing harm to them as a couple, that's a valid personal boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, using financial reasons to end a relationship might be seen as selfish, especially if the partner is pursuing a career they care about. But the author also mentions the potential risk to patients if the ND practices unproven methods, which adds another layer of concern for public safety.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the breakup was based on genuine incompatibility and ethical concerns or purely on materialistic and financial reasons. The author's justification involves both, but the core conflict is the belief system. If the author can't reconcile with those beliefs, it's a valid reason. However, the way he phrased it (focusing on money) might make it seem like he's prioritizing material aspects over the relationship. But the deeper issue is the pseudoscience, which might not be a valid reason for a breakup but is a significant personal choice.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the breakup was due to irreconcilable differences in core values (scientific vs. pseudoscientific views in a healthcare context), even though the financial aspect is a material concern. The key is whether the beliefs are a deal-breaker, which is subjective. Since the author couldn't accept the career path due to ethical concerns, it's not necessarily wrong, but it's a tough call. However, using financial reasons might not fully capture the severity of the belief differences. So, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the core issue is values, not just money.\n"
