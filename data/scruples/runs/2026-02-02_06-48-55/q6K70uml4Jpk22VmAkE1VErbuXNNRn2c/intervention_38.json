Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The writer feels conflicted because they love their partner but can't support her career choice, which they see as based on pseudoscience. They also mention financial concerns about the cost of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for the breakup. The main points are disagreements about medical beliefs and financial burden. The writer says love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their vision of the future doesn't align with their partner's. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key, especially regarding core values. Here, the partner is in a field that the writer fundamentally disagrees with, thinking it could be harmful. The writer is concerned about the financial aspect, which is a valid practical concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing her passion and career goals. The writer is using their beliefs about science to justify the breakup but acknowledges that love should transcend material things. They feel guilty because they care deeply, yet they ended the relationship over these issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. If the partner's career is a deal-breaker due to conflicting values and financial concerns, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. But if the writer is ending the relationship primarily due to differing beliefs that the girlfriend is committed to, perhaps that's a problem. However, it's also valid to have boundaries about life choices. \n\nI think the writer is not in the wrong because they had to make a decision based on their values and practical concerns. However, the way they ended the relationship might be harsh, but they aren't necessarily \"in the wrong.\" Relationships require mutual agreement on major issues, and if the partner's path is a fundamental disagreement that can't be resolved, ending the relationship is a personal choice.\n"
