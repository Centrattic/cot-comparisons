Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. The writer feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to disagreements over pseudoscience and financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points of the situation. The boyfriend is upset because the girlfriend is committed to a field he views as based on pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. These are scientifically debunked. The financial aspect is also a concern, with $200k in debt for her ND school, which he would have to support. The breakup was due to conflicting visions for the future, not just money but also their beliefs about medicine.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if others would agree. So, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, love is supposed to accept differences, but there's a line when it comes to serious disagreements that affect each other's lives. If the girlfriend's career involves promoting harmful practices, like avoiding conventional medicine for cancer, that could be a valid concern. However, the author also acknowledges that NDs can have a place as an alternative, just not as a replacement for modern medicine. \n\nOn the other hand, the breakup being due to financial reasons and differing beliefs might be seen as materialistic. The author mentions that friends and family say it shouldn't matter, yet he still prioritizes his views. But the deeper issue is whether the girlfriend's career could lead to harm. If she's advising patients against proven treatments, that's a red flag. However, the author's approach was to break up rather than try to work through the conflict or support her with boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision was based on genuine concern for potential harm versus personal dislike of her career. If the girlfriend is practicing within legal limits and not directly endangering patients (like advising against chemotherapy), then the author's break up might be more about personal values. However, if her work could lead to real harm, that complicates things. The author's sister being an ND graduate might indicate a family support system, but that doesn't validate the practices.\n\nAlso, the financial burden is a significant point. The author might feel he can't take on that debt, which is practical. But is that a fair reason to end a 10-year relationship? Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit when it comes to core values. The author's stance is that pseudoscience is dangerous, which he might believe strongly enough to end the relationship over. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author's concerns are valid and justified. If the girlfriend's career involves promoting harmful practices, the author isn't entirely wrong to be concerned. However, breaking up over this might come off as dismissive of her passion and not addressing the issue constructively. The author could have tried to communicate and set boundaries instead of ending the relationship. So, I think the author is not in the wrong because his concerns about pseudoscience and potential harm are legitimate, even if his approach was flawed. But maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
