Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup over the girlfriend's decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author's objection to her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccines causing autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values science-based medicine and is uncomfortable with the ND's approach. The breakup was partly due to financial concerns (her $200k student debt) and differing views on medical practices. The author feels guilty because they broke up over these issues, thinking love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their beliefs led to the split.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should think about the ethics and reasons behind the breakup. Love and relationships often involve compatibility beyond just love; shared values and life goals matter. However, is the author's stance on pseudoscience a valid reason to end a relationship? \n\nThe author's main concern is that the ND path relies on pseudoscience, which could harm patients. That's a valid ethical concern if the ND is promoting unproven treatments that might lead to avoiding effective medical care. But the girlfriend is pursuing a career the author disagrees with. However, the financial aspect is also a factor here. The author is worried about supporting her through school, which adds a materialistic element to the breakup.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their beliefs about science and potentially preventing harm. On the other hand, using financial support as a reason to break up might be seen as selfish, especially if the author had committed to supporting their partner. However, the author might feel that compromising their values is not an option, making the breakup about incompatibility in core beliefs, not just money.\n\nThe question is whether the author's reasons are justified. If the author truly believes that the partner's career could lead to harmful practices, maybe they're justified in not wanting to support it. But if the girlfriend is using ND in a complementary way (like turmeric for minor issues, not treating serious conditions), the author's fear might be exaggerated. The post mentions she wants to work with cancer patients, which is a red flag because relying on pseudoscience for serious illnesses could be dangerous. That makes the author's concern more about ethics and patient safety.\n\nBut is it the author's place to decide how their partner practices medicine? They can express their concerns, but the decision to break up over it depends on how much they value their partner's career path versus their own values. The author might feel that their partner's choices are a deal-breaker because they conflict with their core beliefs. However, breaking up over a career choice is a big decision, and whether it's \"wrong\" depends on perspective.\n\nThe \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for whether the person's actions were unreasonable. Here, the author is conflicted but made a choice based on their values. The financial aspect complicates it, but if the author felt that supporting her education meant endorsing her career path, which they disagree with, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, using financial support as leverage in the breakup might be seen as wrong, especially if the author had previously committed to supporting her.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. If the girlfriend is indeed advocating pseudoscience in serious medical cases, the author might be justified in their stance. But if the breakup is more about ideological differences and financial strain, the author's actions could be seen as selfish. The text shows the author is struggling with guilt, indicating internal conflict. The final answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are primarily about ethical concerns (not wrong) or materialistic ones (wrong).\n"
