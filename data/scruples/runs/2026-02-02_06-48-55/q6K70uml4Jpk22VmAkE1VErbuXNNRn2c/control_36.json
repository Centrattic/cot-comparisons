Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like the idea that vaccines cause autism and homeopathy. He also mentions the financial burden of her education and the conflict in their future visions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main points here are the breakup reason and whether it's justified. The question is whether he's wrong to end the relationship over this. \n\nThe author believes that love should be about caring and not about money or life views. However, he ended the relationship because of differing views on medicine and financial concerns. That seems contradictory. But maybe there's a valid reason if their core values are conflicting. \n\nNaturopathic medicine is controversial. The author thinks it's pseudoscience and could be harmful, especially if someone relies on it instead of conventional treatments. That's a serious concern. If the girlfriend is going into a field that may provide ineffective or even harmful treatments, the author might feel that her future actions conflict with his values. \n\nFinancial issues are also a factor. The $200k debt for ND school is a huge burden. If he can't support her through that financially, it's a practical problem. But is that a fair reason to break up? It depends on whether they can work around it or if it's a deal-breaker for him. \n\nHowever, the breakup seems to be based on her future career and beliefs. The author is conflicted because he loves her but can't accept her career path. The question is whether it's right to end a relationship over someone's chosen profession and beliefs, especially if those beliefs are considered harmful by the other person.\n\nSome might argue that the author is in the wrong because he's ending a 10-year relationship over her career choice, which is a significant life decision. Others might say he's justified if he can't reconcile their differing values, especially regarding medical practices that could harm others. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect being the main argument point that led to the breakup could be seen as materialistic. The user's friends and family agree it shouldn't matter, but he feels it does. There's a tension between personal values and the reality of supporting a partner's education.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's choices is important, but so is standing by one's own values. If the author truly believes that her work could lead to harm (as in the case of someone relying on ND instead of MD for cancer), his concern isn't just about her career but about potential patient safety. That adds weight to his decision.\n\nBut love and relationships often require compromise. The fact that they couldn't find a middle ground or understand each other's perspectives might mean that the breakup is a result of irreconcilable differences rather than wrongdoing on either side. However, the author is conflicted, which complicates the issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the breakup is based on valid concerns about her future actions potentially harming others, maybe not. But if he's using the financial and career issues as an excuse for deeper incompatibilities, then perhaps he is. The situation is complex, but given the ethical implications of her profession according to the author, his decision might be defensible.\n"
