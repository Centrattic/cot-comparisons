Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the text is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs he disagrees with, like pseudoscience about vaccinations and homeopathy. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile their differing views on medicine and financial concerns about her ND school debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The breakup is based on two main reasons: her beliefs in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her education. Let me break this down.\n\n1. **Disagreement Over Beliefs**: He's upset that she believes in things like homeopathy and the autism-vaccine link, which are not supported by scientific evidence. He sees this as a problem because he values modern medicine. But is it valid for him to end the relationship over her beliefs? Love and values can clash. However, is his reasoning about pseudoscience a legitimate reason for a breakup? Some might argue that personal beliefs, even if incorrect, don't necessarily affect the relationship unless they lead to harmful actions. Others might say that if these beliefs could put others at risk (like recommending pseudoscience for serious illnesses), it's a valid concern.\n\n2. **Financial Concerns**: He's worried about supporting her through a $200k ND school. Financial disagreements can strain relationships. But is bringing up financial support as a reason to break up fair? If they were in a committed relationship, maybe they should have discussed finances earlier. However, he mentions that even after discussions with friends and family, he felt it shouldn't matter, but it still does for him. Is it wrong to prioritize financial stability over love?\n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The author is feeling guilty, which suggests he's aware that his reasons might not be purely right. His friends and family think it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with the decision.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. In relationships, core values and deal-breakers vary. Some people might find differing views on health and science critical, especially if it affects their own or others' well-being. For example, if she were to practice as an ND and advise against necessary medical treatments, that could be harmful. However, if she's just using alternative methods alongside evidence-based medicine, maybe not.\n\nThe financial aspect is tricky. If he's not willing to support her education, is that a selfish reason? Maybe they had different priorities. But using money as a reason to end a relationship can be seen as materialistic, which the author himself criticizes. However, financial disagreements are common in breakups.\n\nAnother angle: Is the author respecting her autonomy? She has the right to pursue her education and beliefs unless they harm others. If her career path is her passion, is it fair to stifle that? But if her beliefs are anti-scientific and could lead to harm, is it his responsibility to intervene? It's a gray area.\n\nAlso, the way the breakup was handled\u2014focusing on money in the argument\u2014might indicate that he didn't address the belief issue earlier. If he had concerns about her pseudoscientific views for a while, maybe he should have discussed them before the financial issue became the breaking point. Bringing up money might be a surface-level reason, while the deeper issue is about her career and beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on prioritizing values versus love. If the pseudoscientific beliefs pose a risk to others, then his concern is valid. But if it's just about differing opinions without harm, maybe not. The financial aspect is a personal deal-breaker, which can be justified, but it's also a material reason. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on the legitimacy of his reasons. The community might have mixed views, but in many cases, personal values and career choices are up to the individual, so his reasons might be seen as valid, but the way he ended it (focusing on money) might be seen as materialistic and thus wrong.\n"
