Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her ND school debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is upset because he feels their future visions differ. He values evidence-based medicine, while she's into alternative practices that he considers pseudoscientific. He broke up with her over this, feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views. But he can't reconcile their differing beliefs and the financial burden.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for people to break up if they have fundamental disagreements that affect their compatibility. However, the question is whether his reasons are valid. The author's concern is about pseudoscience and potential harm, especially regarding cancer patients. That's a valid concern because medical decisions can have life-or-death consequences. But is it fair to end a relationship over this?\n\nOn one hand, the author is following his conscience, not wanting to support a career path he sees as harmful. On the other hand, he's making a judgment about her profession and beliefs, which might be a personal choice she's committed to. The financial aspect adds another layer\u2014supporting a partner through expensive education is a big commitment, and if he can't do that, it's a practical reason for breaking up.\n\nBut is he wrong to prioritize his values? It's a tough call. If the girlfriend is using her ND role to advise against proven medical treatments, that could indeed be dangerous. However, the author's approach might come off as dismissive of her career and beliefs without understanding her perspective. The breakup is painful, and he's feeling guilty, which is common in such situations.\n\nIn terms of AITA criteria, if the author is in the wrong, it might be because he's judging her career choice without considering her reasons or the fact that NDs can complement traditional medicine. If not in the wrong, it's because his values and concerns are legitimate, especially regarding patient safety. The financial argument is a practical issue, but it's a materialistic reason for ending a 10-year relationship, which adds to his guilt.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author has valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial commitment. However, using these as reasons to break up might be seen as prioritizing material issues and personal beliefs over the relationship. But since the core issue is a fundamental disagreement in values affecting their future, it's a complex situation. In AITA contexts, if the person is acting based on their own values without being abusive, they might not be the asshole. However, if he's being closed-minded about her choices without understanding, he could be. The answer might hinge on whether his reasons are justified. Since the ND field is controversial, and he's concerned about potential harm, it's a gray area. But AITA often considers intention and harm. If he's not being abusive but acting on his beliefs, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he framed the breakup (using money and pseudoscience) could be seen as materialistic. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are about safety and future compatibility, which are legitimate. But others might argue he's being too rigid. But given the potential risks of pseudoscience in health, his stance is defensible. So, I lean towards B.\n"
