Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her career choice due to pseudoscientific beliefs. The main issues here seem to be differences in values regarding medical science, financial responsibility, and whether these should affect a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is upset that he ended the relationship over something he now sees as materialistic. He mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet he broke up because of her career path and the associated debt. That seems contradictory. But he also has valid concerns about pseudoscience, which could affect patient safety if the ND relies on unproven methods for serious conditions like cancer.\n\nHowever, personal beliefs about alternative medicine can be deeply held and part of someone's identity. The key is whether the relationship could have been maintained despite these differences. The author feels that their future visions are incompatible, but breaking up over disagreements in life choices might be a matter of perspective. Financial aspects, like supporting her 200k debt, add another layer of stress, but is that a valid reason to end a 10-year relationship?\n\nThe author's friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but personal values and what one can accept in a partner do matter. The question is if his reasons are justified. While respecting her choice is important, if he can't support her career due to ethical concerns, maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible values. However, the fact that he's questioning his decision and feeling guilty might indicate that he's prioritizing his own values over hers, which could be the root of his feeling wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if his decision is based on his values and future plans. However, the way he ended the relationship focusing on financial support might be seen as materialistic. But since relationships require mutual support and shared values, if they couldn't reconcile their differences, the breakup might be necessary. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
