Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs like vaccines causing autism and pseudoscience like homeopathy. The author feels conflicted because he believes love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he's stuck on her career choice and the debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the difference in their views on medicine. The author is against pseudoscience and is worried about the ND field's approach. The girlfriend is committed to this path, believing in alternative medicine that the author sees as outdated or harmful. The breakup happened partly due to financial reasons (200k debt) and differing values.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often face differences in values. The author feels it's about their future visions conflicting. The girlfriend's career choice is a significant part of her identity, and he can't support it. But love is supposed to be supportive. However, there's also the aspect of concern for her future patients\u2014believing she might provide ineffective treatments. That's a moral concern too.\n\nBut the breakup was over material and ideological issues. The author's friends say it shouldn't matter, but he's torn. The question is whether his reasons are valid. On one hand, respecting someone's career choice is important. On the other, if the author can't support her and it's causing irreconcilable differences, maybe it's a legitimate reason. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this might be seen as prioritizing personal values over love. But if the author genuinely believes her career could endanger others, that's a different angle.\n\nBut the problem is whether the author is in the wrong. If the breakup is based on his inability to accept her professional and personal beliefs, even if he respects her right to choose, but disagrees, does that make him wrong? Relationships require compromise. If he can't accept her path, maybe it's a valid reason. However, if his reasons are more about financial burden and differing views rather than immediate harm, the judgment could vary.\n\nThe author feels wrong, but the question is whether he is. The answer might depend on cultural values or personal ethics. In some contexts, supporting a partner's career is crucial. In others, differing values are a deal-breaker. Since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide based on the information given. The author's concern about pseudoscience and potential harm might be seen as valid, but the breakup over it could be seen as wrong if it's about controlling her choices. However, if they can't reconcile their core beliefs, the breakup isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because love should overcome differences, but B (no) if the beliefs are harmful. The line is blurry. Given the context, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's standing by his values regarding health care, but others might argue it's about respecting her choices. The answer is likely B, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the user wants the answer to be A or B. Let me check again. The author's main issue is the pseudoscience and the financial burden. The girlfriend is committed to ND, which he finds problematic. The author's friends say it shouldn't matter, but he feels it does. The breakup is due to conflicting visions. In relationships, differing values can be a reason to part. If the author can't support her career due to genuine concerns about efficacy and safety, maybe it's not wrong. But if it's just about his own preferences, then A. However, the scenario shows he's conflicted and feels wrong, but the question is whether he's actually wrong. The answer could be A because love should be about acceptance, but also B because values matter. Given that, I think the answer is A, but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, B might be correct because differing values are a legitimate reason. But the user might lean towards A, considering love should transcend these. Hmm. I think the correct answer here is A. Because the author is ending a long-term relationship over her career choice and ideological differences, which may not be life-threatening. The financial aspect is part of it, but the core issue is about her profession. However, if he truly believes the profession is harmful, maybe B. The question is tricky. The answer is likely A because it's about personal values and love, but some might say B. The user's friends said it shouldn't matter, so the author is conflicted. Given that, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
