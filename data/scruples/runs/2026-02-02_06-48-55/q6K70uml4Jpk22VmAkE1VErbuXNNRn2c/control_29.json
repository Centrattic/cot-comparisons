Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and her beliefs in pseudoscience. The answer needs to be either A or B, where A means the author is wrong and B means they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author is in a 10-year relationship and breaks up because of differing views on healthcare. The girlfriend wants to become an ND, which the author sees as promoting pseudoscience like homeopathy and linking vaccines to autism. The author is concerned about the financial burden of ND school and the potential harm from alternative medicine. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here are: differing values about science and medicine, financial responsibility, and whether personal beliefs should affect a relationship. \n\nIn terms of ethics, breaking up over such a significant issue might not be inherently wrong if both parties have irreconcilable differences. However, it's important to assess whether the author's reasons are valid or if he's being overly rigid. \n\nThe girlfriend's career choice is a major life decision. The author is worried about the financial aspect (200k debt) and the ethical implications of her work. But is it fair to end a relationship over her career in a field he disagrees with? Some might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't override love, while others might say that core values are crucial for a relationship to thrive.\n\nThe author feels guilty because he thinks love should transcend material issues. However, others might say that if two people can't align on fundamental beliefs, especially those affecting others (like medical advice), then the relationship might not be sustainable. The girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience could lead to harmful practices, which is a concern for the author.\n\nFinancial support is another factor. If the author feels he can't support her education, that's a practical issue. But using money as the main reason might be a surface-level problem when the deeper issue is the disagreement on medical views. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect. Even if they disagree, mutual respect is key. The author criticizes her field harshly, calling it pseudoscience and worrying about patient harm. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, which could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is standing by his values and making a tough choice, which isn't wrong. But if he's dismissing her life goals without understanding her perspective, he might be in the wrong. The breakup is painful for both, but the question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there's no clear right or wrong. However, since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on ethical standards. If someone's career and beliefs are causing a fundamental conflict that can't be resolved, ending the relationship might be necessary. But if the author's stance is too rigid without considering her reasons or if he's prioritizing his views over the relationship without effort, he might be wrong. The fact that friends and family said it shouldn't matter suggests that others think the author overreacted. However, the author's concern about potential harm from her work is a valid ethical concern.\n\nGiven the complexity, it's a tough call. I think the author's decision is based on his values, but if he's unwilling to find a middle ground or respect her choice despite disagreements, he might be in the wrong. However, if the core issue is about protecting patients from harmful practices, then his stance is defensible. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A. But given the context, I'm leaning towards B because the author is prioritizing his values and concerns about potential harm, which could be seen as justifiable.\n"
