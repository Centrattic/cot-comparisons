Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in certain pseudoscientific ideas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author ended the relationship because of differences in their future visions, specifically her attending ND school, which he views as pseudoscience. He mentions her belief in things like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy, which are not supported by scientific evidence. He also brings up financial concerns about her $200k student debt and his unwillingness to support her through that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is ending a 10-year relationship over differing beliefs and financial commitments. Love and relationships often involve compromise, and choosing to end a relationship because of such differences might be seen as extreme. The author's reasoning is based on his values regarding science and medicine, but is that a valid reason to break up? Also, citing financial support as a reason could be seen as materialistic, especially in a long-term relationship. The fact that the girlfriend's sister is also in this field and the author is concerned about potential harm from pseudoscience is a point, but should that be the basis for ending a relationship?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about his partner's career choice and beliefs, which he sees as harmful. If he truly believes that her work could lead to ineffective or dangerous treatments for patients (like those with cancer), that's a significant ethical concern. However, is it the role of a partner to end a relationship over career and belief differences, even if they are strong? Also, the financial aspect: if he's not willing to support her education, maybe that's a personal limit, but is it fair to end a relationship over that?\n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to break up over incompatible values. However, the line between a valid difference in values and a materialistic reason (like money) can be blurry. The author's justification is based on his opposition to her career and beliefs, which he thinks are harmful. But is that enough? The girlfriend's choice to pursue ND is her right, even if he disagrees. The fact that her sister is in the same field suggests it's a family choice, which might not necessarily be harmful, even if he disagrees.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt are clear, and he's questioning his own decision. That might indicate internal conflict about whether the breakup was the right call. However, if the core issue is about the relationship's sustainability due to fundamental disagreements, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. But using money and career as the main reasons, especially after a long relationship, might make others (and possibly the user) think he's prioritizing material aspects over love.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person acting had a valid reason and if their actions were justified. Here, while the author has his reasons, they might be seen as overly prioritizing his beliefs and financial concerns over the relationship, leading to the conclusion that he's at least partially in the wrong. However, if the beliefs are truly incompatible and the author feels they conflict with his values to the point of being harmful, that's a different angle. But in most cases, such differences don't necessarily warrant a breakup unless there's direct harm involved.\n\nGiven that the girlfriend is entering a field the author strongly disagrees with and he's unwilling to support her financially, the breakup might be seen as his choice based on his priorities. However, the emotional impact he's feeling suggests he's conflicted. The key here is whether the breakup was about the relationship being incompatible or about material and personal beliefs. If it's the latter, especially when love is present, the community might side that he's in the wrong for letting non-essential issues (in their eyes) break up a long-term relationship.\n"
