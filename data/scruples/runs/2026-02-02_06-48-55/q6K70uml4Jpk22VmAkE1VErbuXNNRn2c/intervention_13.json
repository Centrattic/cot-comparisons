Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because the girlfriend is going into a field they view as pseudoscience, especially with her beliefs about vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. They also mention financial concerns about her $200k debt. But they feel bad because they think love shouldn't be about money or views, just about caring.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her career path. The author is worried that her field might not be effective, even dangerous if it leads people to avoid modern medicine. They broke up because their visions for the future are too different. The author feels guilty but can't reconcile their differences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author is breaking up over differing beliefs and financial burdens. But is it fair to end a relationship over fundamental disagreements, especially in a field where the author has strong ethical concerns? The girlfriend isn't forcing the author to adopt her beliefs, but the author sees her career choice as potentially harmful. However, love is supposed to involve accepting each other's differences. If they can't resolve this, maybe the breakup is inevitable. The author might be right in their own mind, but is it wrong? It's a tough call. The guilt the author feels suggests they think they are wrong, but the decision might be based on personal values conflicting too much. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) or B (not). \n\nBut considering that the author is prioritizing their values over the relationship, and the girlfriend's choice is her own, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they can't compromise on something they find ethically problematic. However, using financial support as a reason could be seen as materialistic. But the core issue is conflicting worldviews. The question is whether it's wrong to end a relationship over such differences. Since people do break up over incompatible values, the author might not be in the wrong. But if love is supposed to transcend those, maybe they are. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A because they might have let material concerns and differences override their love, but the ethical concerns could justify it. Alternatively, B if the decision was based on valid personal boundaries. The user's initial thought is A, but I need to decide. Maybe it's a B because it's about personal beliefs and how they affect future plans. But the author feels guilty, so maybe they are in the wrong. I'm confused. Let me check again. The key points: the author can't accept her career because of pseudoscience risks. They broke up over money and values. The girlfriend's choice is her own, but the author can't support it. In relationships, you need to compromise. If they can't, breakup is a choice. But is the author wrong? If they can't live with her beliefs, maybe it's not their fault. So B. But if they should have accepted her for who she is, then A. I think the author isn't in the wrong because relationships require mutual respect and if the beliefs are a deal-breaker, it's okay to leave. So B.\n"
