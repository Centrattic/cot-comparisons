Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and has pseudoscientific views. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is upset that he ended the relationship over what he calls material things\u2014money and differing views on medicine. He feels like love shouldn't be about these things. But his main argument is about their conflicting visions for the future, particularly regarding her career path and beliefs that contradict modern science.\n\nThe girlfriend is going into a field (ND) that the author views as pseudoscientific, especially with her beliefs about vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. The author is concerned about the potential harm of relying on alternative medicine over proven medical practices. He also mentions the financial burden of her education, which he would have had to support, as a factor in the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Freedom of Choice in Relationships**: In a relationship, people often have to balance personal values with their partner's. If their core values or beliefs are fundamentally incompatible, it can lead to a breakup. However, is a career choice and belief in alternative medicine a deal-breaker?\n\n2. **Scientific vs. Alternative Medicine**: The author is clear that he believes in modern medicine and is concerned about the girlfriend's views. However, the girlfriend's career choice isn't illegal or unethical. NDs are licensed in some places, even if their methods are controversial. The author's fear that she might harm patients by not using MDs is a valid concern, but is it enough to end a 10-year relationship?\n\n3. **Financial Burden**: The author is worried about supporting her through $200k of school debt. That's a significant financial commitment. If the author isn't willing to take on that debt, is he wrong to base a decision on that? Financial disagreements are common reasons for breakups.\n\n4. **Communication and Understanding**: The author seems to acknowledge that his reasons might not be the most important (money and career) but feels they are insurmountable. Did they try to find a middle ground? The argument that led to the breakup focused on money, which he later regrets. Maybe the real issue was about their differing values and whether they could accept each other's paths.\n\n5. **Moral Judgment**: The author is making a moral judgment about her career and beliefs. Is it fair to end a relationship based on moral disagreements, especially when those beliefs are part of her career and identity?\n\n6. **Impact on the Relationship**: The breakup was over a career choice and beliefs. The author is torn between his love and his values. It's painful, but does that make him wrong? Relationships require compromise, and if both can't meet in the middle, it's a valid reason to part ways.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is wrong because he's ending a long-term relationship over differences that don't directly affect their shared life (unless her career impacts their joint decisions, like medical choices for their children or family). However, if her career and beliefs lead to decisions that the author finds harmful (e.g., not seeking proper medical care), that's a different matter. The financial aspect is also a personal choice\u2014supporting a partner's education is a big commitment, and he may not be willing to take on that debt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as right in prioritizing his values. If he can't accept her career and beliefs, especially regarding pseudoscience, it's a fundamental incompatibility. The fact that her sister is in the same field might indicate a family commitment, making compromise less likely.\n\nSo, the answer balances between whether the reasons are valid deal-breakers or if the author is overreacting to differences that don't fundamentally impact their relationship. The key is whether the author is justified in his decision based on the premises given.\n"
