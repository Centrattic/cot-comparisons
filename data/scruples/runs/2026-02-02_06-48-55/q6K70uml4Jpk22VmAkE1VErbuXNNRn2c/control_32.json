Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a naturopathic doctor (ND) and holds beliefs like vaccines causing autism, which are considered pseudoscience. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to his belief in modern medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The relationship ended because of fundamental disagreements about career and beliefs. The author is worried he's being materialistic, focusing on money and school debt, but also on the pseudoscientific aspects of her chosen field. He mentions that he values love and care but can't reconcile their differing views on medicine.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility on core values is important. If two people can't agree on something as significant as medical beliefs, especially when it could affect health decisions, that's a major issue. The author is concerned that trusting ND over MD could be harmful, like in cancer cases. That's a valid concern because relying on unproven methods can have real consequences.\n\nHowever, the breakup over money might seem harsh. The user mentions 200k debt, which is a lot. But if the career choice is tied to beliefs that the author finds dangerous, it's not just about money. The author might be right to prioritize health beliefs, but the way he framed the breakup (focusing on money) could have added to his guilt.\n\nLove and respect are supposed to be central, but when core values clash to the point of potential harm, it's a tough call. The author might not be wrong if the relationship wasn't sustainable due to these differences. But if the breakup was solely because of financial reasons without addressing the actual belief conflict, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his decision is based on a fundamental difference in values regarding medical practices, which can impact life choices and safety. However, the way he approached the breakup might cloud the issue. But the core issue isn't just money\u2014it's the pseudoscientific beliefs that could lead to harmful outcomes. Therefore, he might be justified in his decision despite feeling conflicted.\n"
