Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also brings up financial concerns about her student debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the conflict between their views on alternative medicine versus modern medicine. The author is uncomfortable with the pseudoscientific aspects of naturopathy and is worried about the financial burden of her education. The breakup was based on these differences in career choice and values.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should think about the reasons given for the breakup. In relationships, differing values can be a valid reason for a split. However, the author's main argument is about pseudoscience and financial support. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about his partner's career leading to harm, which he might see as a serious issue. But on the other hand, he acknowledges that NDs have a place if they act as complementary to modern medicine. He also mentions that the breakup was over money, which he now feels is a materialistic reason. \n\nThe girlfriend's sister is already an ND, so the author's fear might be based on personal beliefs rather than concrete evidence of harm. The author's stance is that pseudoscience should not be condoned, but breaking up over someone's career choice and beliefs might be seen as overreacting, especially in a 10-year relationship. \n\nHowever, if the author truly believes that his partner's career could lead to harmful practices (like advising against conventional treatment for cancer), that's a significant moral concern. But he also admits that love should not be about money or views on life, yet he ended the relationship over those very issues. \n\nI should also consider the emotional aspect here. The author feels terrible about the breakup, which suggests he's conflicted. The community often looks at whether the action was justified or if the person is holding onto unrealistic expectations. \n\nIn AITA posts, the key is whether the person crossed a line. The author is breaking up over his partner's career choice and beliefs, which are personal and valid for her. Unless there's a direct harm or danger, it might be considered a personal choice. However, the author's specific concerns about pseudoscience and financial support are his deal-breakers. \n\nBut is it the author's place to dictate his partner's career path? Maybe not. Relationships require compromise, but if one's values are fundamentally incompatible, that's a valid reason. However, the author's main point about pseudoscience might be a red herring if the ND field isn't as harmful as he portrays. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's using his partner's career choice and beliefs as a reason to end a long-term relationship, which could be seen as imposing his views on her rather than supporting her despite differences. Unless there's direct harm, personal beliefs shouldn't be the basis for a breakup. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
