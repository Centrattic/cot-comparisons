Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her pursuing a naturopathic doctorate. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her career choice and beliefs in alternative medicine. He's concerned about pseudoscience and financial debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the breakup. The main issues are differing values regarding medical practices and financial responsibility. The author believes in modern medicine and is worried about his girlfriend's views on things like vaccinations and homeopathy, which he sees as pseudoscientific. He's also concerned about the financial burden of her education.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, love is supposed to accept differences, but there are also practical considerations. The girlfriend is committed to her career path, which the author can't support. The financial aspect is a real concern, especially if he feels he can't afford to support her through school. However, breaking up over this might be seen as prioritizing material concerns over love, which the author himself acknowledges. \n\nBut on the other hand, core values and beliefs about health can be fundamental. If one partner is in a field that could potentially harm patients by promoting unproven treatments, that's a serious issue. The author is worried about the consequences of her work, which is a valid health concern. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to end the relationship based on these disagreements might be seen as right in terms of personal values but wrong in terms of love and support. It's a tough balance. The key here is whether the disagreement is about something that affects their compatibility as a couple beyond just career choice. If the girlfriend's beliefs lead to actions that could harm others, it's a red flag. But if it's just a difference in opinion without active harm, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that his friends and family think it shouldn't matter, yet he still feels it does. This internal conflict suggests he's aware that breaking up over this might not be fair, but his values are causing him to act. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial issues, the decision to break up over these differences might be seen as the wrong choice because it's ending a long-term relationship over disagreements that might not be deal-breakers in the context of a committed relationship. The answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because love and relationships often require compromise, and the material issues might not outweigh the emotional investment.\n"
