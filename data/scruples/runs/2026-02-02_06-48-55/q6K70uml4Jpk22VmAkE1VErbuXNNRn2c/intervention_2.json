Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the main issues are the pseudoscience beliefs (like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy) and the financial burden of her ND school. They also express a conflict in their visions for the future. The breakup is causing them a lot of emotional pain, and they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few aspects. Relationships often end due to differing values or life goals. Here, the core issue seems to be about conflicting views on medical science. The author disagrees with the girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience and the potential risks of her career in naturopathy. They also mention financial concerns, which can be a significant factor.\n\nBut is it right to break up over this? It depends on how critical this issue is to the relationship. If the author can't reconcile their values and the relationship becomes untenable, then maybe the breakup is justified. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to form my own. One argument is that love should overcome differences, but others might say that core values, especially those affecting health and safety, are non-negotiable. The author feels conflicted because they love her but can't support her career path. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author is concerned about the debt and supporting her through school. That's a real issue, but is it a deal-breaker? If the relationship is built on trust and communication, maybe they could find a solution. However, if the author can't support her financially, that's a valid reason to step back.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that naturopathy is pseudoscience and could lead to harm is a key point. If they think her work could endanger patients, that's a serious concern. But is it fair to break up solely based on that belief? It's a personal choice, but it's also possible that the author is letting fear or misunderstanding influence the decision.\n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how essential their values are. Since they couldn't reconcile the differences and felt the breakup was necessary, it might be seen as a difficult but justified decision. However, if the conflict could have been managed with compromise or better communication, then maybe the author acted prematurely. But given the information, the author chose their values over the relationship, which is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n"
