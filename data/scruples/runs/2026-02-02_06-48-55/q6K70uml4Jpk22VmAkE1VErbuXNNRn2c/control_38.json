Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up because their future visions differ. His main issues are her belief in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her ND school. He feels conflicted because he loved her a lot but couldn't reconcile these differences.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Breakups are rarely black and white, but the question is about whether his reasons are justifiable. The key points are her beliefs and the financial aspect. \n\nHer beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccine-autism link are not supported by science. The author is concerned about her future practice possibly leading to harm if patients rely on ineffective treatments instead of conventional medicine. That's a valid concern, especially if she's working with cancer patients. However, is it grounds for a breakup? People have different beliefs; maybe he felt it was too important because of potential risks.\n\nThe financial aspect: $200k debt for ND school, which he'd have to support. Financial disagreements can strain a relationship. But ND is a real degree, though more controversial. The cost is high, but it's a personal choice. If he couldn't support that financial commitment, that's a personal decision.\n\nBut is it the author's \"wrong\" to break up over this? Relationships require compromise. If he couldn't accept her career path and beliefs despite loving her, maybe it was an honest difference in values. However, breaking up over beliefs and money is a personal choice. The question is whether his reasoning is fair. \n\nThe author feels guilty, which is natural. But is he wrong? If the breakup was because of her beliefs that he found harmful, is that valid? It's a matter of perspective. Some would say it's wrong to end a relationship over beliefs that don't directly harm others, while others might agree that such fundamental disagreements are deal-breakers.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are unreasonably harsh. The author's reasoning is controversial. While he's concerned about pseudoscience, it's her choice and career. Unless she's actively harming others, maybe it's her right. But if he can't support her in that, then it's a personal decision. The financial part is also a matter of their relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice to leave over incompatible values and financial issues. Even if others think he's being harsh, it's not necessarily wrong to choose to end a relationship over such deep differences.\n"
