Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and they disagree with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccinations cause autism. The author thinks that while alternative medicine can have a place, they can't support giving up on modern medicine. They also mention financial concerns about the ND school's cost. The person feels bad about ending a 10-year relationship over this.\n\nFirst, I should consider what factors make a breakup justified. In relationships, differences in core values can be a deal-breaker. Here, the author is concerned about their partner's career path and beliefs, which they see as potentially harmful. They mention pseudoscience and the risk of patients relying on NDs instead of MDs for serious issues like cancer. The financial aspect is another point\u2014the $200k debt for ND school that the author would have to support.\n\nOn the other hand, love and compatibility aren't just about agreeing on everything. The author admits that love should be about caring and feelings, not material things, but they still broke up over this. It's possible that their decision was influenced by a fear of their partner promoting harmful practices, especially with the example of the sister graduating from the same school.\n\nI need to weigh the author's reasons. Is it fair to break up over differing beliefs about medicine? If one partner's career choice poses a risk to patients, maybe the author isn't wrong to be concerned. However, should personal beliefs about alternative medicine be a deal-breaker in a relationship? It's a tough line. The author might feel that the potential harm outweighs their love, but others might argue that this is an overreaction.\n\nAlso, the financial burden is a practical issue. The author can't support a $200k debt, which is a significant financial commitment. That's a valid concern for some people in relationships. But if the author was willing to support a partner in other careers, is it fair to say they're being judgmental about this specific field?\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is \"dead set\" on her path, so maybe the author realized they couldn't accept that part of her. In long-term relationships, being unable to support each other's career choices can lead to conflict. However, the author could have tried to find common ground or compromise instead of ending the relationship.\n\nThe author's family and friends told them it shouldn't matter, suggesting that others see the breakup as unnecessary. But the author personally feels it does matter, which complicates things. It's possible that the author is projecting their own values onto the relationship, not respecting the partner's choices, which could make them in the wrong.\n\nBut if the author genuinely believes that the ND practices are harmful, especially in cases like cancer treatment where relying on pseudoscience could be life-threatening, then their concern is valid. They might feel a moral obligation to prevent their partner from promoting potentially dangerous practices.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a mix of factors. On one hand, they broke up over beliefs and finances, which are significant. On the other, they have valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial stability. However, a 10-year relationship ending over these issues might indicate that the author prioritized their own values over love and partnership. The key is whether the author's reasons are justified or if they're using them as an excuse to avoid conflict or personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns, ending a long-term relationship solely over differing views on alternative medicine and financial commitments might be seen as being in the wrong, especially if they acknowledge that love shouldn't be about material things. The answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they prioritized their own beliefs over the relationship, but there's a case for B (they aren't in the wrong) due to the serious nature of the issues involved.\n"
