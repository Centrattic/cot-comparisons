Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to his beliefs in modern medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author broke up because of differing fundamental beliefs about medicine. He's concerned about her future career, which he views as promoting pseudoscience, and the financial burden of her education. The question is whether his actions were justified or if he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships often involve accepting each other's differences. If the relationship was otherwise healthy, maybe the break-up is too drastic. But on the other hand, if the beliefs are so conflicting that they affect the author's values and future plans, it might be a valid reason. However, the main point of contention is the disagreement over scientific beliefs. The author values evidence-based medicine, which is a legitimate stance, and he's worried that her career could lead to harmful practices, especially in cancer patients. This could be a significant moral issue for him.\n\nBut is it the right reason to break up? Relationships can survive differences if both parties respect each other's views. The fact that the author focused on financial support as the main point in the final argument might indicate that the underlying issue is more about their differing values. However, if the author truly believes that her career choices are dangerous, he might feel that staying in the relationship would compromise his ethics.\n\nThe girlfriend's commitment to her career, which he sees as promoting pseudoscience, might create an irreconcilable conflict. But the question is whether that's a valid reason for a breakup. The author might be right to have his own beliefs, but using financial support as the reason could seem materialistic, even if it's a symptom of a deeper disagreement.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing his views on medical science over the relationship. While respecting differing opinions is important, when it comes to matters of public health and safety, personal beliefs can become a moral concern. However, the break-up might be seen as the author imposing his views rather than finding a middle ground.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong if the disagreement is a fundamental deal-breaker for him. But others might argue that the break-up is too extreme, and the author should have tried to work through the differences. The key factors are the validity of his concerns about pseudoscience and whether the break-up was justified based on those concerns. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author acted based on his genuine beliefs and values, even if others might think he's overreacting, he's not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
