Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscience aspects like her beliefs about vaccines and homeopathy. He also mentions the financial burden of her education. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upset because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his and his ex's visions differ. He's struggling with feeling wrong for ending the relationship over this. The main reasons for the breakup are her career choice (ND) and the associated debt.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, relationships often require compromise and respecting each other's beliefs. If the girlfriend is committed to her career, even if he disagrees with some aspects, maybe he should have found a way to support her. However, if her career path involves beliefs that could harm others (like rejecting vaccines leading to autism, which is debunked), that's a red flag for him. His concern might be about safety and ethical reasons.\n\nFinancial support is another factor. He mentions 200k debt for her school, which he might not be willing to take on. That's a significant financial decision, and it's valid if he feels he can't support that. But is it wrong to base a breakup on financial reasons? It's a personal choice, but maybe there's a lack of communication or compromise here. \n\nHe also feels that love shouldn't matter, but he's torn. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, so maybe family influence is a factor. The author is worried about the ND providing ineffective treatments to critical patients. That's a serious ethical concern for him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex. It's possible that both parties had valid reasons. The author's stance on science vs. his partner's beliefs might be irreconcilable differences. However, breaking up over it could be seen as prioritizing his values over the relationship. But if those values are about health and safety, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are valid. Financial support is a personal choice. If he can't handle the debt, he's not wrong. But if the main issue is her career's ethical implications, then his decision might be based on moral grounds. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have supported her without endorsing her career, just respecting her choice. But if her work might lead to harmful outcomes, that's a different story. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a tough call. The author might not be entirely wrong because he has his reasons based on beliefs and financial capability. However, if he couldn't find a middle ground or work with her perspective, that might be a failure in the relationship. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because his reasons are based on personal values and financial constraints, which are valid considerations in a relationship.\n"
