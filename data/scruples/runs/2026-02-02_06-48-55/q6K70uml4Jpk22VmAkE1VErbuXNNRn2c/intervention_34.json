Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this breakup post is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going into Naturopathic medicine, which he views as pseudoscience and potentially harmful, especially since she believes in things like vaccinations causing autism. He also mentioned financial concerns about her 200k debt for school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issues here. The breakup was over differing values. The author feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but in this case, those differences led to the split. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to his beliefs in modern medicine.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, it's common for people to break up over incompatible values. If someone's career is based on beliefs the other person finds unethical or harmful, that's a significant issue. The author is worried about his partner providing ineffective treatments, which could be dangerous, especially for cancer patients. That's a real concern because medical practices can affect people's lives and health.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is ending a long-term relationship over this, which is a major decision. He's questioning if he's wrong because he loves her deeply. He feels bad about using money as a reason, which might be a surface-level issue compared to the deeper conflict of their views on medicine. However, the financial aspect is part of the practical reality of supporting her education.\n\nI should also consider the ethical aspects. If one partner is in a field that the other believes could harm patients, is it reasonable to stay in the relationship? The author feels that his partner's work could lead to relying on placebo effects instead of proven medical treatments. That's a serious ethical concern, especially when it comes to vulnerable patients like those with cancer.\n\nBut at the same time, relationships are complex. People have different values, and it's natural for incompatible values to lead to breakups. The key is whether the author's reasons are valid. If he can't support her career because he truly believes it's harmful, even if she's passionate about it, that's a fundamental disagreement. However, some might argue that he should respect her choice even if he disagrees, unless there's direct harm.\n\nAnother angle is the financial burden. He's concerned about supporting her through school, which adds a materialistic element. But if the core issue is the ethical stance on her profession, then the financial aspect is part of the larger issue of supporting a career he disagrees with.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on his beliefs about medical ethics and the potential harm of his partner's profession. While it's painful to end a long-term relationship over such issues, his concerns are valid if he truly believes her work could be dangerous. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong because the breakup is based on fundamental differences in values related to health practices. However, others might argue that he should have found a way to support her despite his disagreements. But given the potential ethical implications of her work, his stance could be seen as justified. So, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
