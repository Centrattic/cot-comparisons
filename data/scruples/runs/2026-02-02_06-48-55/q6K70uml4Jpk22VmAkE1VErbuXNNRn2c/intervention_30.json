Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke up with his girlfriend over her decision to attend ND school. He mentions that she believes in pseudoscience, like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are disproven. He feels that NDs have a place but can't support giving up modern medicine. His main points are about the money (200k debt) and the beliefs conflicting with his view on science. However, he also mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views but about caring. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile these differences.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, he's ending a 10-year relationship because of fundamental disagreements on important issues like healthcare beliefs and financial responsibility. He feels he can't support her career path because of his strong convictions about science and medicine. On the other hand, he's breaking up over material things like money and differing worldviews, which he initially says shouldn't matter. He's also concerned that her career might lead to harm if people rely on ND instead of MDs.\n\nBut is it fair to break up over this? Well, if both partners have core values that are incompatible, then it might be a valid reason. However, the way he frames it, he's struggling with the idea that love should override these differences. He also points out that his friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it's a problem. The main issue is whether the decision is about incompatible values (which is valid) or if he's using that as an excuse to avoid dealing with deeper issues, like financial responsibility or fear of debt. Additionally, his criticism of her field's pseudoscience vs. her belief in alternative medicine could be a cultural clash.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is committed to her career, and he's not willing to support her financially or morally because of disagreements. If they were in a committed relationship, supporting each other's career choices is part of the partnership. However, if he's not willing to take on the debt or the potential risks of her career, that's a valid personal choice. But is it right to end a long-term relationship over this? It depends on whether these differences are deal-breakers for both parties. He might not be in the wrong if these are his non-negotiables, but if he's prioritizing his values over her happiness without considering her perspective, maybe he is.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect\u2014200k debt is significant. If he's not willing to take that on, maybe it's a practical decision. However, using the beliefs as a reason adds another layer. It's possible he's conflating the financial burden with the pseudoscience aspects. The key is whether the breakup is about the career choice itself (values) or the financial implications. If it's the latter, maybe it's more about financial responsibility, but if he's breaking up because of her beliefs, that's a values conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships require compromise. If both can't compromise on core issues, ending the relationship might be necessary. However, if one person is making a decision based on something that's not directly affecting the relationship (like career choice) unless it's causing harm, that could be problematic. Here, the author is concerned that her career might lead to harm (people dying because they don't see MDs), which adds a moral concern. But is that a valid reason to end a relationship? It's a personal choice, but it's also important to consider if her actions are actually harmful. The ND field's effectiveness is debated, but as long as she's practicing within legal bounds, maybe it's her choice. However, if he truly believes she's endangering people, that's a serious issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong if the core values are incompatible and he's made his stance clear. But the way he frames the breakup, emphasizing the material aspects and the pseudoscience, might indicate that he's overreacting. He's also struggling with the emotional weight of ending a long-term relationship, which adds complexity. The friends and family saying it shouldn't matter suggest that maybe he's overemphasizing the issue. However, if he's certain that their fundamental disagreements are insurmountable, then the breakup could be justified. It's a tough call, but the key factors are whether the differences are deal-breakers and if the breakup is based on valid concerns or personal biases.\n"
