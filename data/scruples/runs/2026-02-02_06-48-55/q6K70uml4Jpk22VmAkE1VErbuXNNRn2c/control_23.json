Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and he's against the pseudoscience aspects of that field. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is set on ND school, which the author sees as promoting pseudoscience like homeopathy and linking vaccines to autism\u2014claims that are debunked. The author values modern medicine and can't support her choice, even though he acknowledges NDs have a place as an alternative. The financial aspect is also a factor; he would have to support her through $200k in debt. The breakup is causing him a lot of emotional pain, and he's questioning if he's wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, values and core beliefs can be deal-breakers. If someone's career path conflicts with your fundamental beliefs, especially regarding health and science, that's a significant issue. The author is concerned about pseudoscience, which could affect patient outcomes, especially in serious cases like cancer. If the girlfriend is advising against conventional medicine in favor of unproven methods, that's a legitimate concern for someone who trusts modern medicine.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships are supposed to involve compromise. The author is prioritizing his values over the relationship, which might be seen as selfish. However, staying in a relationship with someone whose career could lead to harmful practices might be ethically challenging. The financial burden is another point\u2014supporting a partner through such a costly degree is a big commitment, and not being able to do so isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it's a dealbreaker for the author.\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but their perspective might not consider the long-term implications of the girlfriend's career. The author's reasoning is based on his belief in evidence-based medicine and concern for patient safety. While it's painful to end a 10-year relationship over this, if the core values are incompatible, it might not be fair to stay together. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Relationships require mutual respect. If the girlfriend is firm in her path and the author can't support her, then maybe it's not his fault. However, could he have tried to find a middle ground? Maybe, but if her beliefs are non-negotiable and he can't live with that, then it's a matter of personal boundaries. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reasons are valid. Since the issue is about core values and potential harm, some might side with him. Others might argue that love should be enough. But given the pseudoscience aspect and financial commitment, his decision might be seen as justified. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
