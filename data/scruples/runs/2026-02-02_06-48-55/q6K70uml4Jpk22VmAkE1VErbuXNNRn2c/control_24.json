Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author breaks up with his girlfriend because her career choice and beliefs conflict with his views on science and medicine. He feels that NDs rely on pseudoscience and that he can't support her going into that field. He also mentions financial reasons, like the $200k debt from her ND school, which he would have to support. The breakup is causing him a lot of emotional pain, and he's questioning whether he made the right decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, it's common for differences in core values to lead to breakups. But is this a case of valid concerns or overstepping?\n\nThe girlfriend is pursuing a career in a field that the author disagrees with strongly. The ND field has been controversial because of its reliance on practices not supported by evidence, like homeopathy and the vaccine-autism link, which have been thoroughly debunked. The author is worried that as an ND, she might provide ineffective treatments, especially for serious conditions like cancer, which could be life-threatening. This is a significant concern because if someone is giving medical advice based on pseudoscience, it could harm patients.\n\nHowever, the author also acknowledges that NDs can have a place as an alternative to modern medicine, as in the example of using turmeric for a bruise. So he's not entirely against alternative medicine but has a line where he can't support giving up on evidence-based practices. His main issue seems to be with the lack of scientific validity in the treatments she might provide.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. The cost of ND school is high, and the author is concerned about taking on that debt. Relationships often require compromise on finances, but if one partner is unwilling to go into significant debt that the other can't support, that's a valid reason to part ways.\n\nBut then there's the emotional side. The author feels guilty, thinking that love should transcend these issues. He's wondering if he's wrong for prioritizing his values over love. But in a long-term relationship, shared values, especially when they impact major life decisions and ethical concerns, can be crucial. If one partner's career could potentially harm others due to pseudoscientific practices, that's a serious ethical issue that can't be ignored.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's choice is her own, and the author is making a judgment about her career path and its implications. If she's committed to her beliefs and career despite his concerns, he's questioning whether he can live with that. It's a case of incompatible life goals. Relationships often end because of such fundamental differences that can't be reconciled, even if both parties love each other.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is overstepping by using her career and beliefs as a reason to break up. On one hand, it's reasonable to consider the ethical implications of her future profession. On the other, if the breakup is primarily about differing views on alternative medicine, which can be a matter of personal belief, it might be seen as overly rigid. However, when those beliefs involve potential harm to patients, especially in critical cases like cancer, the ethical concern becomes more significant.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her sister is already an ND, implying that this is a family commitment. That might add pressure on him to support it, which he feels he can't do. The financial burden is a practical issue, but it's intertwined with his ethical objections.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision isn't simply about money or career choice but about a fundamental disagreement on the validity and ethics of the field his partner is entering. If he truly believes that her profession could lead to harmful practices, it's a valid concern. However, if he's dismissing her choice without understanding her perspective or if he's using pseudoscience as a reason without considering other factors, that could be problematic. But given the context, where the practices she's entering are scientifically questionable and could lead to real harm, his decision might be based on valid ethical concerns, making him not in the wrong.\n"
