Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), which he associates with pseudoscience like homeopathy and the belief that vaccinations cause autism. He's upset because he feels the breakup was over material things like money and career choices instead of love. He also mentions the financial burden of her school debt and his concerns about the effectiveness and safety of ND practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of his reasons. The girlfriend is pursuing a career in a field the author disagrees with. While personal beliefs and values are important in a relationship, love and compatibility often require some level of compromise. However, in this case, the author is making a moral judgment about her career choice, which he views as pseudoscientific and potentially harmful. That's a significant issue because if a partner's career involves practices that could harm others (like advising against necessary medical treatments), it could be a legitimate concern for the other partner.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. The author mentions the debt and his unwillingness to support her through it. Financial disagreements can strain relationships, but it's about whose responsibility it is. If he was unwilling to support her education, maybe they didn't discuss financial expectations earlier. However, using financial support as a reason to break up might indicate a lack of willingness to compromise or communication issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing her passion and career goals, which are important for personal fulfillment. The author's concerns about pseudoscience are valid in a scientific context, but how much should personal beliefs override someone's career choices? It's a balance between respecting each other's paths and ensuring mutual values align on critical issues like health and safety.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He's feeling guilty and heartbroken, which can cloud judgment. Ending a 10-year relationship over this might suggest that the differences were irreconcilable, but it's hard to say without more context on their communication and attempts to resolve the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author's concerns about pseudoscience are based on scientific consensus, so he has a point there. However, using that as a reason to end the relationship might be disproportionate if the girlfriend isn't actively promoting harmful practices. The financial argument could be a separate issue, but combining both might have been the tipping point.\n\nUltimately, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the relationship couldn't overcome these fundamental differences, maybe it wasn't sustainable. But if he could have found a way to support her while addressing his concerns, then he might be at fault. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that personal beliefs and career choices can be deal-breakers, it's a tough call. However, the author's decision to end the relationship based on her career choice and financial support might be seen as his way of protecting his values, which isn't necessarily wrong. But it's possible that he didn't handle it well, leading to the breakup over material issues. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were justified by the severity of the issues. Given that, I think the author isn't in the wrong (B), but I'm a bit conflicted because it's a complex situation.\n"
