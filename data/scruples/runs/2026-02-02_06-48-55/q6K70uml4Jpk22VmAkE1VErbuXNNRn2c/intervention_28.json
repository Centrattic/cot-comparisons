Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and has certain beliefs about alternative medicine, like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. The author feels that these beliefs are pseudoscientific and is concerned about the financial burden of her education. They're upset that the breakup was over such material issues despite loving her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: whether it's justifiable to end a relationship over differing beliefs about medical practices. The author argues that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their actions were based on those factors. On one hand, personal values and future goals are important in a relationship. If someone's career choice and beliefs conflict significantly with your own, especially when it comes to matters of health and science, it can create a rift. The author is worried about their partner promoting potentially harmful practices, which could affect others (like patients with cancer). That's a valid concern about public health and ethics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is feeling guilty for ending a 10-year relationship over these issues. They mention that love shouldn't be about material things, but they still ended it. The girlfriend's career choice is a personal decision, even if they disagree. However, the author's concern isn't just about the career but the underlying beliefs that they see as pseudoscientific. This might indicate a deeper philosophical or ethical disagreement. \n\nBut is it right to break up over this? Relationships require compromise, but there are deal-breakers. If the disagreement is about fundamental values that affect each other's lives (like rejecting evidence-based medicine), maybe it's a valid reason. The financial aspect is also a practical concern, though the author acknowledges friends and family said it shouldn't matter. However, the author still sees the financial burden as a problem, which is a personal value judgment.\n\nAnother angle: respect for each other's choices. The author respects NDs as an alternative but can't accept their partner's specific path and beliefs. The girlfriend is \"dead set\" on her path, so maybe the author realized they couldn't support her in this. In that case, the breakup might be about incompatibility rather than right or wrong.\n\nBut the emotional impact on the author is significant. They feel like they did something wrong, questioning their own actions. The key is whether the author's reasons are justifiable. If the concern is about endangering patients, that's a public safety issue. However, the ND field does exist and has regulations, even if the author disagrees with the practices. The author's sister being in the field adds complexity\u2014maybe they're aware of the risks but still choose their path.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the right if the disagreement is about fundamental values that the author can't compromise on. However, breaking up over this could be seen as wrong if the concern is more about personal preference than actual harm. Since the author's stance is about pseudoscience leading to potential harm (like not treating cancer with MD), it's a tough call. But in terms of relationship compatibility, it's a matter of personal choice and values. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, as they acted on their values, even if it's a difficult decision.\n"
