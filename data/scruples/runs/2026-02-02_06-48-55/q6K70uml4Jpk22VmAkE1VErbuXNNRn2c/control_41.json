Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccinations leading to autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her student debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The breakup is based on differing views on medical practices. The author values modern medicine and is concerned about the potential harm of pseudoscience, especially in treating serious conditions like cancer. The girlfriend is committed to her field, which the author sees as lacking scientific basis.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for differences in values to cause issues. But is it wrong to break up over this? Well, the author's reasoning is that he can't support someone who he thinks might provide ineffective or harmful treatments. However, others might argue that personal beliefs, even if disagreeable, shouldn't dictate the end of a relationship unless there's direct harm.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. He mentions the $200k debt and his role in supporting her through school. That's a significant burden, and financial disagreements can strain relationships. But is it valid to use that as a reason to break up, especially if they were planning to be together? It might depend on how they discussed their financial future beforehand.\n\nThe author also feels guilty, thinking love shouldn't be about money or life views. But he's struggling with the conflict between his feelings and his values. The question is whether his actions were justified. Some might say he's right to prioritize his values if he can't reconcile the differences. Others might say it's wrong to end a long-term relationship over beliefs that don't directly affect their daily life together, unless there's a risk of harm.\n\nThe girlfriend's field, ND, is controversial. The author fears she might give a false sense of security to patients who need actual medical treatment. If her practice could indeed lead to harm, that's a serious ethical concern. But the line between pseudoscience and alternative medicine can be blurry. The author mentions that he's okay with non-harmful practices like turmeric but not when it comes to critical illnesses. That distinction is important.\n\nIn terms of relationship advice, it's often said that major differences need to be addressed. If both can't compromise, ending the relationship might be a last resort. However, the author's approach was to end it over financial support and beliefs, which might not have been the only solution. Communication and counseling could have been alternatives.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author wrong? He has valid concerns about potential harm through her career, but breaking up over disagreements in ideology and financial support is subjective. It's possible he's not in the wrong if he's convinced her path is harmful. However, if the relationship was based on love and mutual respect, ending it over these issues could be seen as prioritizing his values over his partner's autonomy, which might be where he's wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. If the breakup was based on respecting her choices despite differing views, maybe not. If it's about imposing his beliefs or financial pressure, then maybe he is wrong. The key is whether the concerns are justified in terms of actual harm versus personal disagreement.\n"
