Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her pursuing a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) degree. The main points the author raises are about the pseudoscientific views the girlfriend holds, like believing vaccinations cause autism and supporting homeopathy, which he disagrees with. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k debt for ND school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the breakup. The author feels that their future visions are incompatible because she's committed to a field he views as pseudoscience. He acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but here, his core values (scientific medicine) clash with her career path. \n\nBut is that a valid reason to break up? Relationships often require compromise, but there are situations where core values are so conflicting that it's unsustainable. The girlfriend's beliefs could lead to harmful practices, like advising against vaccines, which the author is against. If she's going into a field where she might provide ineffective treatments for serious conditions like cancer, that's a significant ethical concern for him.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. He mentions that he would have to support her through the debt, which is a big commitment. If he's not willing to take on that financial burden, especially for a field he doesn't support, that's a personal decision. However, using money as the main reason might mask deeper disagreements about her profession's validity.\n\nThe author also feels guilty, thinking he should be okay with it, but he isn't. His friends and family agree it shouldn't matter, but he can't reconcile his beliefs. The key here is whether the disagreement is about something that actually endangers their relationship or each other. If the girlfriend's profession could lead to her giving advice that might harm patients (like those with cancer), that's a red flag. But if her role is more about complementary care, maybe it's less problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that he can't condone giving up modern medicine suggests he's prioritizing scientific validity over his partner's career. It's possible that they had tried to resolve this before, leading to the argument. The fact that her sister already has the same degree and he's worried about the worst-case scenario (patients dying) shows his concern is real and not just about money.\n\nHowever, the breakup is based on his inability to accept her career choice, which he sees as based on pseudoscience. Love and respect are important, but so are ethical boundaries. If he truly believes her career is harmful, can he support her in that without compromising his values? The girlfriend might see her career as a calling, and the author might feel ethically conflicted about her work.\n\nIn such cases, where one partner's career involves practices the other finds unethical or harmful, especially in healthcare, it's a valid reason for a breakup. The author isn't wrong if he can't live with supporting a practice he believes is dangerous. On the other hand, if there were other ways to address the issue (like setting boundaries, not agreeing on every medical approach), maybe the breakup could have been avoided. But since the conflict is about fundamental beliefs and the financial commitment to a degree he opposes, it's a tough spot. So, the answer might be B (No), as he's making a decision based on his principles, even though it's painful. Alternatively, if the disagreement isn't as severe and the author could have found a middle ground, then A (Yes). But given the depth of the disagreement and the potential for harmful practices, B seems more appropriate.\n"
