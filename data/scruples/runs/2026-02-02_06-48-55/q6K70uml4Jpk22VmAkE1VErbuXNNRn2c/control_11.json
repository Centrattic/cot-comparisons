Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because he believes she's going into a field that promotes pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are scientifically debunked. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k student debt for ND school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The break up is based on differing values regarding medical practices. The author values modern medicine and is concerned about the potential harm of pseudoscience in ND, especially in cancer treatment. The girlfriend is committed to ND despite his objections.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements over fundamental beliefs can lead to incompatibility. However, love and respect are supposed to be the foundation. The author seems to have a valid concern about his partner's professional stance, which he sees as harmful. On the other hand, he ended the relationship over financial and ideological differences, which might be seen as materialistic, given that love is often supposed to transcend such issues.\n\nBut is it wrong to break up over this? If one's partner's career choice involves promoting practices that the other believes are dangerous, that's a significant ethical concern. The author isn't just upset about money; he's genuinely worried about the potential consequences of her work. However, he might be projecting his own biases here. Not all NDs are the same, and the girlfriend might have her own reasons and ethical considerations in her practice. The author's judgment of her career path as inherently harmful could be a misunderstanding of the field's nuances.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a practical concern. Supporting a partner through an expensive education is a big commitment. If the author feels that this debt and the associated career path conflict with his values and financial stability, that's a legitimate reason for feeling conflicted. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this seems extreme, especially if there was no compromise or discussion. The fact that he feels so wrong about it suggests internal conflict between his values and the reality of ending the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's sister being an ND graduate might indicate a family influence, but that doesn't inherently validate the career choice. The author is concerned about the placebo effect and potential harm to patients, which is a valid ethical concern. However, the decision to break up because of her career choice could be seen as prioritizing personal beliefs over the relationship, which might not be fair if the girlfriend isn't promoting harm intentionally.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns about pseudoscience and financial strain are real, ending a long-term relationship over these issues is a major decision. The answer hinges on whether holding such strong opposing views on such a fundamental issue justifies the break up. Since relationships require mutual respect and understanding, if the girlfriend is unwilling to change her stance and the author can't accept it, the break up might be seen as the right choice despite the emotional pain. However, some might argue that the author should have tried to find common ground or support her differently. The key is whether the author prioritized his values over the relationship, which isn't inherently wrong, but the way it's handled could be seen as harsh.\n"
