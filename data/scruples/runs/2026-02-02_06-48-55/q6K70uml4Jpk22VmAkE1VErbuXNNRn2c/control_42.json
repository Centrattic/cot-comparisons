Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author disagrees with her views on alternative medicine, pseudoscience, and the financial aspect. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their visions for the future are different. The girlfriend is set on attending ND school, which he sees as based on pseudoscience like homeopathy and the discredited idea that vaccines cause autism. He believes in modern medicine and is against giving up on it. He also brings up the financial burden of $200k in debt and his potential responsibility to support her through school.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, love is supposed to accept each other's differences. But when those differences involve core beliefs and life choices, it can be a deal-breaker. The author is concerned about the financial aspect and the validity of the career path. If he can't support her in this, maybe it's a legitimate reason to break up. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this might be seen as harsh, especially if the financial issue isn't a current problem but a future one. \n\nBut the deeper issue is the conflict in values. If he can't accept her career choice, which he views as pseudoscientific, that's a significant difference. However, the way he framed the argument\u2014focusing on money and his own inability to support her\u2014might make it seem like the break up was more about financial concerns than the actual beliefs. It's possible that the financial aspect was the immediate trigger but the underlying issue was the disagreement on her career path. \n\nAlso, the author feels bad because he loves her a lot, but if these are core issues that make him unhappy, then maybe it's not necessarily wrong. However, is it fair to end a long-term relationship over something that's a personal choice, even if he disagrees? It's complicated. There's a balance between respecting each other's choices and personal red lines. If he can't support her in her career, which is a major life decision, maybe that's a valid reason. But he might also be projecting his own values onto her, assuming she's a bad ND when she might use alternative methods but still recommend modern medicine when necessary. \n\nThe key points here: 1) Disagreement on career path and its validity, 2) Financial burden, 3) Values conflict. The author might not be in the wrong if he can't reconcile these differences, but the way he chose to end it (focusing on money) might make it seem like he's avoiding the real issue. However, the financial aspect is a real concern if he can't afford to support her debt. \n\nBut is it wrong to break up over this? It's a personal decision. The author might not be in the wrong if he can't accept her career. However, the fact that he's struggling with guilt and the breakup is causing so much pain suggests that maybe he's not fully considering her perspective. But ultimately, it's his right to decide what he can and can't accept in a partner. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because it's about personal differences and values, and it's okay to part ways if you can't reconcile them. However, the way he framed the argument might be a bit self-serving, but that's common in breakups.\n"
