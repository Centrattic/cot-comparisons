Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the relationship lasted 10 years, which is a significant amount of time. The breakup is because of a fundamental disagreement about their future. The author is troubled by the girlfriend's belief in pseudoscientific practices, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccinations cause autism. He's not against alternative medicine per se, but he's against abandoning modern medicine. The main points he raises are the money (200k debt for ND school) and the ethical concerns about her future practice potentially harming patients. \n\nHe feels guilty because he believes love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their visions are incompatible. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still broke up. The key here is whether breaking up over these reasons is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's career choice is a big part of her identity and future. If the author can't support her in something he considers harmful, that's a major conflict. However, the breakup hinges on two main issues: financial commitment and differing views on medical practices. \n\nThe financial aspect is a practical concern. Supporting someone through a costly education is a huge commitment. If he's not willing to take on that debt, it's a legitimate reason for conflict. The other is the ethical stance on pseudoscience. The author is worried that her career could lead to harmful outcomes, which is a valid concern if he prioritizes evidence-based practices.\n\nBut where is the line between personal beliefs and relationship compatibility? Love and respect for each other's goals are important. If the author can't respect her career path because he disagrees with its methods, maybe the incompatibility was there all along. However, the breakup is framed as a last resort after their visions diverged. \n\nIt's also worth considering if the author is overstepping by making a decision based on his beliefs about her profession. Unless she's actively harming people, it's her choice to make. The author's role is to support her, not dictate her career based on his values. However, if their core values are so conflicting that they can't see a future together, then breaking up might be a result of their incompatibility, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nThe guilt he feels suggests he's conflicted. He loves her but can't reconcile their differences. The question is whether prioritizing his values and financial boundaries over the relationship makes him the \"bad guy.\" In some contexts, supporting a partner's career is a sign of commitment. But if the career path is ethically problematic to the point of potential harm, it's a more complex issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions stem from personal values and financial concerns. While his reasons might not be malicious, breaking up over such issues can be seen as prioritizing his own beliefs over the relationship. However, if the relationship was already strained by these factors, it's a matter of whether the breakup was the right decision for his well-being. The answer likely leans towards him not being in the wrong if the core issue is incompatibility, but the framing of the question might suggest he is in the wrong for not supporting her career despite his reservations.\n"
