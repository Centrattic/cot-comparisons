Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path and their differing views on medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the breakup based on her career choice and her beliefs. The author mentions that he's against pseudoscience and doesn't want to support a field he sees as harmful. However, he also loves her deeply and is struggling with the decision.\n\nIn relationships, differences in values and life choices can lead to conflicts. But is it fair to break up over this? Well, if the core values are irreconcilable, some might argue it's a valid reason. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing his views over the relationship. \n\nThe author's main concerns are about pseudoscience, financial burden, and potential harm from ND practices. However, he acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative. The problem arises when he can't support her career because of his beliefs. But is that enough? \n\nThe girlfriend's views on vaccinations and homeopathy are based on discredited pseudoscience, which the author finds dangerous. If he's worried about her providing harmful advice, maybe that's a legitimate concern. However, love and respect should ideally allow for differing opinions unless it's a matter of safety or abuse. \n\nFinancial support is another factor. He mentions supporting her through 200k in debt, which could be a significant burden. But if they were in a committed relationship, sharing financial responsibilities is part of the commitment. However, if he's not willing to take on that debt, that's a personal choice. \n\nThe author feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views. But in reality, long-term relationships require compatibility in big life decisions. If their visions of the future are incompatible, breaking up might be necessary. However, the way he ended it by focusing on money might be seen as using a material reason rather than the core issue of their differing values. That could make him the asshole because he didn't address the real problem directly and instead used a financial argument. \n\nOn the other hand, if his main issue is her career and beliefs, which he can't support, then it's a valid reason. But the fact that he's struggling with guilt suggests he's aware it's a complex issue. The key is whether her career poses a risk to others (if she's giving harmful advice) or if it's just a difference in opinion. \n\nSince the post doesn't mention her actually harming patients, but rather her intention to work with cancer patients while believing in pseudoscience, that's a red flag. However, in reality, NDs can't legally replace MDs in most cases, so maybe he's overestimating the risk. \n\nGiven all this, the author might be in the wrong if he's using this as an excuse to avoid dealing with deeper issues or if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt. But if their core values are truly incompatible, it's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether his reasons are justified and if breaking up was necessary. Since he feels conflicted but proceeds with the breakup, it's possible he's not the asshole because he's trying to act according to his beliefs, even if it's hard. But the way he ended it (focusing on money) might make him the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he might be conflating financial concerns with the actual issue of differing values, and breaking up over this without addressing the core beliefs might be premature. However, others might argue it's a valid reason. Given the options, the community often sides with those who break up over irreconcilable differences, but the way it's handled matters. Since he's using a materialistic argument, it might be A.\n"
