Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in some pseudoscientific ideas like vaccinations causing autism. The writer feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views but about caring and love. However, they couldn't reconcile their differing visions for the future, particularly around the ND path and associated beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the breakup was justified. The writer mentions that the girlfriend is \"dead set\" on attending ND school, which he sees as pseudoscience. He's concerned about her potentially providing ineffective treatments, even to the point of someone dying because they didn't see an MD. The main points of contention are her career choice (with significant debt) and her beliefs that conflict with modern science.\n\nIn relationships, major differences in life goals can be a deal-breaker. It's one thing to have different interests, but if those differences lead to fundamental disagreements that affect the future of the relationship, it's a valid reason to break up. However, the writer is feeling guilty because he thinks it's about money and material things, not just the beliefs. He also mentions his friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still made the decision based on those factors.\n\nThe key here is whether the writer's reasons are valid. If the girlfriend's career choice is based on pseudoscience, could that lead to harmful situations? The writer is worried about her providing placebo effects instead of proper medical care. However, NDs do coexist with MDs in some contexts, and the girlfriend might not outright reject modern medicine. The writer's judgment of her degree and the school as \"placebo\" is strong. Also, the financial burden of $200k in debt is a practical concern.\n\nBut is it the author's place to decide her career path? Love should ideally be about accepting each other's choices unless they directly harm the other person. The writer is projecting his views onto her, possibly fearing her future actions. However, if she's not planning to replace MDs entirely but to work alongside them, maybe the issue is overstated. The author's guilt might be more about the reason he chose (money) rather than the underlying beliefs. But if he's not willing to support her financially, that's a practical issue. It's important to differentiate between the financial aspect and the ideological one.\n\nThe girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience is a red flag, especially if it affects medical decisions. However, the author could have addressed this through discussion and compromise. Ending the relationship over her career choice and beliefs might be a matter of personal ethics versus relationship compatibility. It's a tough call, but if their core values about health and medicine are incompatible, it's a legitimate reason. On the other hand, if the author is using the financial aspect as an excuse for his discomfort with her beliefs, that's where the guilt comes in.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up may be justified if their differing views on medicine are irreconcilable and impact their future together. However, if the financial burden was the main issue and he's using that as a cover for not agreeing with her career due to pseudoscientific reasons, then he might be in the wrong. The question is whether breaking up over this was the right call, given that love is supposed to be about acceptance. But if the beliefs lead to potential harm, it's a safety concern. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), because if their fundamental beliefs about medicine are clashing and it's a deal-breaker, then it's a valid reason for the breakup, even if it's painful.\n"
