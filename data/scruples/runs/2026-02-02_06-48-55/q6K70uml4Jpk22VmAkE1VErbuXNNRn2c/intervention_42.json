Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted, thinking love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their future visions differ. The main issues seem to be her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccinations causing autism, and the financial burden of her school debt. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset about ending a 10-year relationship over this, which they find materialistic. They argue that love should be about caring, not differences in beliefs or money. However, their main concerns are about her career choice conflicting with their views on science and the financial aspect.\n\nThe girlfriend is determined to go into this field despite the author's objections. The author feels guilty for bringing up money as the reason, which they know shouldn't matter, but it does. Their friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but the author can't shake the feeling that they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, breaking up because of differing beliefs and financial concerns might seem harsh, especially after a long relationship. However, the author is concerned about pseudoscience, which they see as dangerous, especially in treating serious illnesses like cancer. They mention that some ND practices could lead to harmful outcomes if people forgo modern medicine. \n\nThe financial aspect is another point. The author would have to support her through $200k in debt, which could be a significant burden. If they had a child, would they support a partner's career that might not provide stable income? The author might feel that they can't compromise on these core issues, which they see as affecting their future together.\n\nBut is it right to end a relationship over these things? It's a personal decision. The author might feel that their values are non-negotiable, especially regarding health and science. However, love and relationships can also involve compromise. The author might be prioritizing their beliefs over the relationship, which is a tough call. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the primary reason for the breakup is about incompatible values and future plans, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if it's about not accepting her career path despite it being important to her, maybe they are. The author is also worried about the financial implications, which is a practical concern.\n\nIn the end, the decision to break up because of such significant differences is a personal one. If the author believes that these differences are deal-breakers and that they can't reconcile them, then maybe they are not in the wrong. However, ending a long-term relationship over these reasons might be seen as prioritizing their views over the relationship, which could be seen as wrong by some. But others might say that it's about being honest about one's values and future.\n"
