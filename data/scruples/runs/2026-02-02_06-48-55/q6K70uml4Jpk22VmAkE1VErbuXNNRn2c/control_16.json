Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor and holds beliefs he considers pseudoscientific, like the vaccine-autism link. He's upset because he feels like love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but he couldn't reconcile their differing views on medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. He mentions that her beliefs include pseudoscience, which he disagrees with. He's concerned about her future career in ND, which he sees as a place where she might not use modern medicine and could potentially harm patients by relying on homeopathy or other unproven methods. He also brings up financial issues, like the $200k debt from ND school, which he would have to support her through. \n\nOn the other hand, he's saying that he loves her a lot and it's breaking him up. He's questioning his own decision, feeling like he's being a \"total ass hat.\" His friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it's important. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about relationship dynamics. Relationships often break up over differences, but the question is if the reason is justified. He's breaking up over her career choice and beliefs. But is that fair? If someone's career choice leads to harmful practices, does that affect the relationship? \n\nHe's worried about her potentially providing a placebo effect when a real doctor is needed. That's a serious concern, especially in cases like cancer where alternative medicine can delay or prevent effective treatment. However, can he ethically judge her career choice based on his beliefs? Also, is it fair to end a relationship over this, especially after 10 years?\n\nMoney is another factor. He's concerned about supporting her through school. That's a practical issue, but is it the main reason for the breakup? Or is it the underlying belief in pseudoscience that's the core problem?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, he's worried about her future actions as an ND. If she's going into a field that he believes could harm patients, is that a valid reason to end the relationship? It's a matter of personal ethics. However, it's also important to consider that people can have different views and respect each other's choices unless it's causing direct harm. But if he genuinely believes she might harm others, that's a different angle.\n\nAnother angle: Is he respecting her autonomy? Everyone has the right to pursue a career they're passionate about. If she's making an informed choice, even if he disagrees, is it his place to prevent her? The financial support part is more about shared responsibility in a relationship. If he can't support her financially, that's a personal choice, but he's making it a reason to break up, which could be seen as him not being willing to compromise.\n\nBut the main issue is the pseudoscience. If he can't accept her beliefs, which he sees as harmful, is that a deal-breaker? It's a matter of values. Some might say that if you can't respect your partner's choices, even if you disagree, that's a problem. Others might say that if the beliefs could lead to real harm, it's a valid concern.\n\nThe author is feeling conflicted because he loves her but can't get past this. In relationships, compatibility in core values is important. If their views on medicine are fundamentally at odds, maybe it's a sign that they're not compatible in the long term. However, using love as a basis for a relationship, it's possible to have disagreements and find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether his reasons are valid. If her career path is based on harmful misinformation, and he can't accept that, is he justified in ending the relationship? Or is he overstepping by dictating her career choices? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, in terms of ethical considerations, he's making a judgment based on his beliefs about her future profession. If he's not in a position to provide financial support and that's a deal-breaker, that's more of a personal choice. But the core of the issue is her beliefs and the career path. \n\nIf love is supposed to be about caring for each other, then maybe he should support her choice even if he disagrees. But if he can't accept her core beliefs, then maybe the relationship wasn't sustainable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether respecting her autonomy is more important than his own beliefs. If he can't accept her choices, even with love, then maybe it's not his place to stay in the relationship. But others might argue that he's being narrow-minded. \n\nIn the end, the author is conflicted and feels like he's in the wrong. The question is whether he actually is. If the breakup was due to her career choice and beliefs, which he perceives as harmful, but he's not in a position to support her financially, it's a complex mix of factors. However, the main issue is the pseudoscience, which he can't reconcile with his values. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own values and concerns for potential harm. However, others might see it as him being wrong for not respecting her choices. But in terms of the question, the answer would be B (No, he is not in the wrong).\n"
