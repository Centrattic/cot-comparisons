Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor and believes in some pseudoscience. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their breakup is due to a fundamental difference in their views on medicine. He values modern medicine and can't support practices that he sees as pseudoscience, like homeopathy or the idea that vaccines cause autism. The girlfriend is committed to becoming an ND, which he sees as potentially harmful, especially when dealing with cancer patients. He also brings up financial concerns about the $200k debt for her ND school.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on his beliefs about science and medicine, which he feels are important enough to end a 10-year relationship over. He's concerned about her career's validity and the potential risks to patients. On the other hand, he acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he still prioritized his views over the relationship. \n\nHe also mentions that the main argument revolved around money, which he feels is a materialistic reason. However, if the core issue is their conflicting values about medical practices and their future, then money might be a symptom of a deeper problem. The girlfriend's choice to pursue ND is a significant part of her identity and future, so the breakup might be about incompatible life goals.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility in core values is often cited as crucial. If both people can't reconcile their fundamental disagreements, especially when they affect their future together, it might be a valid reason to end the relationship. However, the author feels conflicted because he loves her deeply. The question is whether his reasons are justified. \n\nSome might argue that his stance is about protecting patients from ineffective treatments, but others might say he's dismissing her career choice without understanding her perspective. The fact that he's struggling with guilt suggests he's aware that this is a big decision, but maybe he's also recognizing that their differences are irreconcilable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, since the author is breaking up due to genuine concerns about pseudoscience and its potential harm, some might see that as a valid reason. Others might say that he shouldn't have let his views override the relationship, especially if she's not directly harming others. But considering his perspective that their futures are incompatible, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
