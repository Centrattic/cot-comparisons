Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and they have conflicting views on alternative medicine versus modern science. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions that their girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked. The author supports modern medicine and can't support her career choice, especially with the financial commitment of $200k debt. The breakup was over these differences, and the author is feeling guilty because they think love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their own beliefs caused the split.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, it's common for people to part ways over significant disagreements, especially when they affect each other's lives deeply. The author's main issue is with the girlfriend's career choice and her beliefs in pseudoscience, which they see as harmful. They also mention financial concerns about supporting her through school.\n\nBut is it fair to break up over this? Well, the author believes that their partner's career is based on pseudoscience and could be harmful, which is a serious concern. If someone is entering a medical field, the author might be worried about the ethical implications of the partner's practices. However, the girlfriend might see ND as a valid alternative and the author's criticism as invalidating her choices. \n\nThe financial aspect is also a factor. The author mentions they would have to support her through school, which they can't afford. That's a practical issue. But is it the right reason to break up? Maybe if the author felt they couldn't take on that financial burden, but it's also a matter of personal responsibility and compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet they ended the relationship over those very things. That's a contradiction. However, when core values and beliefs clash, especially in fields like healthcare where the author has strong convictions, it can be a deal-breaker. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, if the girlfriend was committed to a path the author found ethically problematic, and they couldn't reconcile that, then the breakup might be a matter of incompatibility rather than being in the \"wrong.\" The author might believe that supporting a career they see as harmful is against their values. However, they also might be making assumptions about the ND's effectiveness, as some aspects of naturopathy can be complementary to modern medicine, even if parts are pseudoscientific.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is focusing on the financial aspect, which they admit is a material issue. They feel bad for using money as a reason, but it's a real-life constraint. The girlfriend's sister graduated from the same school, so maybe the author is overestimating the harm in some ways. The key is whether the author's stance is based on valid concerns or personal bias.\n\nIn conclusion, while the breakup is sad, if the author's convictions about healthcare and finances are genuine, then they might not be in the wrong. However, breaking up over someone's career choice, especially when it's a matter of personal belief, can be seen as harsh. But given the potential ethical issues with the girlfriend's career path (if the author's concerns are valid), the author might feel justified. It's a tough call, but since the question is about being in the wrong, I think B (No) is the answer because it's a matter of personal values and incompatibility, not necessarily the author being in the wrong.\n"
