Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to be a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he doesn't agree with some of her views, like the pseudoscience around homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. He also mentions the financial burden of her education and his concern about her practices potentially harming patients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issues are differing beliefs about alternative medicine versus modern science, financial responsibilities, and whether these are valid reasons to end a relationship. \n\nThe author feels conflicted because he loves his girlfriend but can't reconcile their fundamental disagreements. He believes that love shouldn't be about money or life views but in this case, their visions are clashing. His main arguments are about the pseudoscience she endorses and the financial commitment he would have to take on. \n\nNow, is he wrong? Well, relationships require compatibility in core values. If someone's career choice is based on beliefs that the other finds unethical or dangerous, that's a big deal. The author is concerned about his partner promoting practices that could be harmful. For example, he mentions that NDs might lead patients to forgo MD treatments, which could be life-threatening. That's a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this might seem harsh because love is supposed to be about caring for each other. But if the fundamental beliefs are incompatible, maybe it's not about being wrong but about being incompatible. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing truth and patient safety. If the girlfriend is in a field that could harm others because it's based on pseudoscience, then the author's stance could be seen as morally justified. However, using financial reasons as the main argument might be a point against him\u2014since supporting a partner's education is a personal choice, and he might feel it's too much. \n\nBut the deeper issue is the belief systems. If the author can't support a partner who promotes what he sees as dangerous misinformation, maybe the breakup is about protecting his values and potential patients' well-being. However, others might argue that he shouldn't dictate her career choices. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because relationships should tolerate differences. If B (no), it's because the core beliefs are a deal-breaker. Given the potential for harm from her practices, the author's decision might be seen as justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
