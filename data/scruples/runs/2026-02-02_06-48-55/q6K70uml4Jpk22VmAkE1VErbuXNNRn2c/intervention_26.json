Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend is going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and linking vaccinations to autism. The author feels like they can't support someone going into a field that contradicts his views on science and medicine. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author broke up because of differing views on science and medicine, money for school, and the potential harm of relying on ND instead of modern medicine. The girlfriend is set on her path, and the author can't support that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLove and relationships often involve compromise, but there are lines people won't cross. The author is concerned about pseudoscience leading to harm, especially with cancer patients. That's a big deal because if someone is relying on ND over proven MD, it could be life-threatening. But on the other hand, the author is focusing on money and career choice as the reason for the breakup. The post mentions that friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but the author still feels conflicted.\n\nIs it fair to break up over fundamental beliefs that could affect health decisions? The author's stance is that they can't condone pseudoscience. However, the girlfriend is choosing a career path, and while the author disagrees with her beliefs, maybe that's her choice. But if her beliefs lead her to recommend harmful practices, like not consulting MDs, that's a problem. \n\nThe author also brings up financial support for her education. That's another point. If they were in a committed relationship, supporting each other's education is part of partnership. But the author isn't willing to take on that debt, which might be a valid personal choice. However, using that as a reason to end a long-term relationship might be harsh. \n\nThe emotional aspect is important too. The author is hurting and feels like they made a mistake. But if the core issue is about values and potential harm, maybe the author is justified. However, if the breakup is primarily about financial burden and not the actual beliefs, then maybe it's not the right reason. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's reasons for breaking up are valid. On one hand, they have valid concerns about pseudoscience and safety. On the other, they might be overstepping by not supporting their partner's career choice if it's her passion, even if it's not aligned with their beliefs. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author is using the financial support as a reason, which others around him say shouldn't matter. The author is in a dilemma between love and their personal ethics. However, if the author cannot accept the career choice and the beliefs that come with it, maybe the relationship couldn't work. \n\nIn the end, if the author can't support the girlfriend's career because of genuine concerns about patient safety, then maybe the breakup is about their incompatibility in values. But if it's more about the money and not being willing to take on that debt, then it's a different story. The author's post seems to mix both concerns. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup is based on the girlfriend's career choice and beliefs, which are her personal choices, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting her for who she is. However, if the author's concern is about the potential harm to patients, it's a more complex ethical issue. \n\nBut the girlfriend is set on her path, and the author can't support it. In a loving relationship, you accept each other's choices unless there's direct harm. Here, the harm is potential if the ND practices are harmful. However, the author's role isn't to control her career but to discuss how to handle their differing views. \n\nThe author might have valid concerns but could have tried to work through them instead of ending the relationship. Breaking up over this might be a premature decision. So, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their disagreements over the relationship. However, if they truly believe that the ND path is harmful and can't live with that, it's a personal decision. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they ended a long-term relationship over financial support and differing beliefs that don't directly harm others, unless the ND practices are actively harmful. But since the author is focusing on money and their own stance on science, which is a personal value, it's a matter of compatibility. If they can't compromise, then maybe it's not their fault. However, the main issue is whether the breakup is justified. Given that love is supposed to accept differences, unless there's direct harm, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
