Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. The author feels bad about it but can't support her career choice because of his beliefs about pseudoscience and the financial burden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the points both sides might make. The author's main issues are the pseudoscientific views of NDs and the financial aspect. He believes that NDs like his girlfriend are promoting unscientific treatments, which could be dangerous, especially with cancer patients. He also brings up the money\u2014$200k debt for school that he would have to support her through.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing a career she's passionate about, even if the author disagrees with the field. He acknowledges that some alternative medicine can be valid but can't accept what he sees as a regression from modern science. The breakup seems to be a result of fundamental differences in their worldviews and future plans.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, love and relationships often involve compromises. If they couldn't reconcile their differences despite care for each other, maybe the breakup is inevitable. However, using financial pressure as a reason to end the relationship might be seen as materialistic, which the author himself acknowledges. But his concern about pseudoscience and potential harm is also valid.\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he feels it does. It's a tough balance between respecting her career choice and his own values. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I have to consider if his reasons are justified. His stance is based on his beliefs, but he's also using the financial aspect as a key point. If he can't support her financially and she insists on this path, the breakup might be unavoidable. However, if their love was strong enough to overcome this, maybe he's wrong to use money as the deciding factor. But the core issue is their conflicting views on science and medicine. If he can't accept her career, even though she's not directly harming him, maybe he's being selfish. But if her work could potentially harm others, that's a concern. \n\nIn the end, I think it's a complex situation where both have valid points. However, the decision to break up over differing beliefs and financial reasons might make the author in the wrong, especially if he acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money. But maybe he's right to prioritize his values. It's a tough call, but I'm leaning towards him being in the wrong because he's ending a long-term relationship over her career, which is a personal choice, even if he disagrees with it.\n"
