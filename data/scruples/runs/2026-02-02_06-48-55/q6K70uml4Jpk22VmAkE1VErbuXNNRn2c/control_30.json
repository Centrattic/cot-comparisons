Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because he disagrees with her pursuit of becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), citing her beliefs in pseudoscience like the vaccine-autism link and homeopathy. He also mentions financial concerns about the $200k debt from ND school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Love and relationships often involve differences, but when do those differences become deal-breakers? The author feels that his love for her is genuine, but their core beliefs about medicine are conflicting. He's concerned about her future career involving pseudoscience, which he thinks could be harmful, especially to cancer patients. On the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about this path, and the author is worried about the financial burden and the validity of her chosen field.\n\nI should think about the reasons behind the breakup. The author's main issues are: 1) Disagreement over pseudoscientific beliefs, 2) Financial concerns about supporting her education, 3) Fear that her career might provide harmful advice. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, big decisions like career choices and financial commitments should be mutual. However, the author is choosing to end the relationship because of fundamental disagreements that he can't reconcile. But is it fair to break up over ideological differences that are non-negotiable? \n\nOn one hand, he's worried about her career's impact and the financial commitment. If these are non-negotiable for him, maybe he's justified in feeling that they can't be together. But on the other hand, using financial reasons to break up might be seen as materialistic, especially if the relationship was built on love. Also, his concern about pseudoscience could be a valid ethical issue if he believes she might harm patients. However, he also acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative, which suggests he's not entirely against the field, just certain practices.\n\nHe mentions that his friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it's a deal-breaker. The question is whether his reasons are legitimate. If he can't support her career and financial path, maybe it's a legitimate reason, especially if it's causing significant conflict. But love is supposed to be about acceptance. However, if the disagreement is about core values that affect their future together, it's a tough call.\n\nAnother angle: Is the author prioritizing his beliefs over the relationship? If he values his own medical views so much that he can't accept her career, is that fair? The girlfriend is pursuing her passion, and he's choosing to leave over this. But if he can't support her, maybe it's not fair to expect her to be with someone who doesn't support her career. However, the financial burden he mentions (supporting her $200k debt) is a practical concern. If he can't afford to support her, that's a real issue. But is it his responsibility to support her education? That depends on their understanding and agreement. If they were planning to be in a partnership where he'd support her education, and now he's backing out, maybe that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact: He's hurting and feels like a bad person. The breakup is causing him a lot of pain, which might indicate it's a significant decision. But the question is about who is in the wrong. If he's acting out of genuine concerns about her career's validity and the financial burden, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the breakup is more about his own unwillingness to compromise, perhaps he is.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the ND field does have practices that can be harmful, his concern might be valid. But if the ND's role is as a complementary approach and not as a sole treatment for serious illnesses, then maybe his fear is exaggerated. The author's sister being an ND graduate suggests the family supports this path, but the author disagrees.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. If he's breaking up because of non-material issues like differing beliefs, which are personal and non-harmful to each other in their relationship, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's using financial pressure as a reason when they were supposed to support each other, that's more materialistic. However, since the girlfriend is choosing her career, and he's choosing to leave over it, it's a mutual decision in a way. The key is whether the reasons are valid for ending a long-term relationship. The fact that he's using the financial issue as a primary reason might make it seem like he's prioritizing money over love, which could be seen as him being in the wrong. However, if he's also concerned about the potential harm of her career, that adds another layer. \n\nIn the end, it's complicated. The answer might depend on whether the disagreement is about core values that affect their future together. If he can't support her career and financial decisions, maybe he's justified. But if he's using those as excuses for deeper issues in the relationship, maybe not. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the situation is presented as him feeling wrong, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's acting based on his beliefs and concerns about their future compatibility. However, others might argue he is in the wrong for letting material and ideological issues override love. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and based on the information, it's a matter of perspective. Given the options, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his concerns are about fundamental differences in values and future plans, which can be legitimate reasons in a relationship.\n"
