Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). They mention that the ND field includes pseudoscience like homeopathy and beliefs that vaccines cause autism, which are scientifically disproven. The author is worried about her using outdated methods instead of modern medicine. They also bring up financial concerns about her going into $200k debt for a 4-year ND school, which he would have to support. The relationship ended over this, and the author feels guilty, thinking they're an \"asshat\" for breaking up over material issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nFirst, consider the core issue: conflicting values. The author believes in evidence-based medicine, while the girlfriend is committed to ND, which he sees as pseudoscience. The author is concerned about her future career's impact, especially if she's treating cancer patients with methods that might be ineffective or even harmful. This is a serious concern, as medical practices can affect people's lives and health outcomes.\n\nOn the flip side, love and relationships often require compromise. The author is ending a 10-year relationship over differing views on medicine and financial burden. Is that a valid reason? It's a big decision and could be seen as using a material issue to justify a breakup, which the author themselves admit is a problem.\n\nBut the author also argues that their values (modern medicine) are incompatible with their partner's (ND). If one can't accept the other's core beliefs, especially in a field where those beliefs could directly affect patient care, is that a deal-breaker? The author is worried that NDs might provide ineffective treatments, which they consider dangerous.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's choice to pursue ND might not necessarily mean she's against modern medicine entirely. The author says NDs have a place as an alternative. But in practice, the author's concern is that she's promoting pseudoscience. This is a clash of fundamental beliefs about health and science.\n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. Supporting a $200k debt is a significant commitment. The author might feel that taking on that debt for a career they disagree with is not sustainable or ethical. But is financial support a valid reason to break up if the main issue is the career choice? The author mentions that friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it does.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests internal conflict. They know the breakup was over material issues (money and career choice) rather than love or emotional incompatibility. That makes me wonder if the author is conflating their personal values with the relationship's stability. \n\nIn relationships, values like health beliefs can be crucial. If one partner is in a profession that the other sees as harmful, it's a serious issue. However, breaking up a long-term relationship over this might be seen as extreme, especially if the partner isn't directly harming others. The author's fear of her providing ineffective care to cancer patients is a valid concern, but does that make the breakup justified?\n\nAnother point is the author's admission that they tried to tell themselves it shouldn't matter but it does. This shows they recognize their own materialism in ending the relationship, which could indicate they're wrong to do so. However, their values are deeply tied to their beliefs about science and health, which are non-negotiable for them.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. They're not wrong to have concerns about pseudoscience, but using those concerns to end a long-term relationship might be disproportionate. However, if their values are fundamentally incompatible, maybe the breakup is a necessary step for their own well-being. It's a complex situation where both perspectives have merit. The author's guilt suggests they feel it's wrong, but their actions are based on their beliefs. The answer might hinge on whether the issue is about health ethics versus personal choices in a relationship.\n"
