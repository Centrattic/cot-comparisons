Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the breakup scenario is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs that he considers pseudoscientific, like linking vaccines to autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k student debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. Relationships often face challenges where values and future plans clash. The key points are the disagreement over professional paths and the beliefs associated with them. The author feels love but can't reconcile the differences in their views on medicine and financial responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, love and respect are supposed to be the foundation of a relationship. If the author truly loves her, why is this a deal-breaker? Also, is it fair to end a relationship over differing beliefs, especially when they haven't even started their careers yet? The girlfriend's choice of profession is a personal decision, and while the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience, that doesn't necessarily mean her intentions are malicious. She might believe she's helping patients, even if her methods are questionable.\n\nHowever, the financial aspect is a real concern. $200k in debt for a 4-year ND program is significant, and the author might feel he can't support her through that. But is that his responsibility? The breakup was prompted by this financial argument, which adds another layer. Maybe the author feels the debt is unjustifiable given his views on the legitimacy of her career. But is it right to base a breakup solely on that?\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that NDs have a place as an alternative, but he can't accept giving up modern medicine. The girlfriend's field might combine both, but if she's unwilling to budge on her pseudoscientific beliefs, that's a conflict. However, is it the author's role to change her views, or should they respect her autonomy even if they disagree?\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is huge. The author is heartbroken, and they had a 10-year relationship. Ending it over these issues suggests deep-seated disagreements that might not be reconcilable. But is the author wrong for prioritizing his values over staying in a relationship?\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions were justified. If the core issue is irreconcilable differences in values and future planning, then it's not necessarily wrong to part ways. However, if the breakup was driven by fear or intolerance rather than mutual respect, then the author might be in the wrong. The problem is that both sides have valid points, but the author's inability to accept her career path despite love complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is painful, it's based on his personal values and concerns. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether these differences are legitimate deal-breakers in a long-term relationship. Since people can have differing values and it's their choice how to handle it, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). But I need to be careful here. The question is if the author is in the wrong. If the breakup was due to valid concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden, then maybe not. But if it's just about differing beliefs without malicious intent, then maybe he is. However, relationships often end when future plans don't align, so it's not always wrong.\n"
