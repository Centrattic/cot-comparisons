Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. I need to figure out the answer based on the given situation.\n\nFirst, the main points: the guy broke up because his girlfriend is entering a field he views as pseudoscientific\u2014naturopathy. He's concerned about her beliefs in things like vaccinations leading to autism, which are debunked. He also mentions financial issues, like her $200k debt. He feels bad about ending a 10-year relationship over these material things. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships are about compatibility. If core values or beliefs are incompatible, that can lead to a breakup. The question is whether his reason is valid. On one hand, he's worried about her beliefs and practices potentially harming patients. If she's going to recommend pseudoscientific treatments over proven medicine, especially for serious conditions like cancer, that's a legitimate concern. He's not against alternative medicine per se but against giving up modern practices. He also brings up the financial burden, which is a practical concern.\n\nBut love and relationships can be about accepting each other's differences. If he couldn't accept her career choice and beliefs, maybe the relationship wasn't sustainable. However, ending a decade-long relationship over this might be extreme. But it's his right to choose his partner based on his values. The sister graduated from the same school, so he's aware someone in the family is doing it, yet he still chose to leave.\n\nThe key is whether the issue is about respecting her choice vs. his ethical or scientific concerns. If he believes her work could be harmful, that's a serious issue. But maybe he could have tried to communicate better, or she might have been open to compromise. However, the breakup decision is final. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one side, he's prioritizing his values and potential harm from her work. On the other, ending a long-term relationship over this might be seen as harsh. But if he truly can't reconcile their differing views on medical practices, especially regarding patient safety, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), as he's making a personal choice based on his beliefs and concerns about her career's implications. However, some might argue it's too materialistic, but the post says he feels it's material, but it's more about values.\n"
