Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a naturopathic doctor, and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her student debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The relationship ended because of differing views on science and medicine, which is a significant issue for the author. He feels guilty because he values love and care, but the breakup was over these material aspects. His main concerns are her profession's reliance on pseudoscience and the financial burden of her education.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Breaking up over fundamental disagreements is a personal decision. Love can withstand many challenges, but when core values clash, it's hard. In this case, the author's issue isn't just about her career choice but her belief in discredited medical practices, which he sees as dangerous. If he truly believes that her future profession could harm others (like patients with cancer relying on naturopathy instead of conventional medicine), that's a serious concern. However, is it enough to end a 10-year relationship?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing a legitimate career path in a field that, while controversial, is legally recognized in some regions. The author's stance is that she's promoting pseudoscience, but naturopathy isn't universally considered quackery. The financial aspect is also a valid concern, as student debt can strain a relationship. But the author's main argument is about the scientific validity of her field, which is a deeper philosophical difference.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his scientific views over the relationship. Relationships require compromise, but when one partner's choices involve what the other sees as harmful or unethical, it's a tough call. The author might believe he's protecting his values, but ending a long-term relationship over this might be seen as harsh. However, if he can't reconcile their differing worldviews, the breakup might be inevitable.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's decision is justified. If he can't accept her career and beliefs, leading to potential harm, he might be right to end it. But if he's dismissing her choices without understanding or compromise, he's in the wrong. Since the post shows he's conflicted and hurting, it's a complex situation. But the decision to break up based on core values is his prerogative. So, the answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision where both sides have valid perspectives.\n"
