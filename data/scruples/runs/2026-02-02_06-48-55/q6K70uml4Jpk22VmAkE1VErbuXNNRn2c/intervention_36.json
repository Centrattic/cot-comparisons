Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to her beliefs in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issues are the differing values regarding medical practices and the financial aspect. The author is concerned about pseudoscience, like the belief that vaccines cause autism, which is debunked. He also mentions the debt from ND school and the potential conflict in their future.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career path and beliefs. The author ended the relationship because he can't align with her views, even though he loves her. The question is whether this decision is justified or if he's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the principles of relationships. Love and respect are important. If core values are incompatible, it can lead to a breakup. However, the author is using financial and ideological differences as the main reasons. But is it fair to end a long-term relationship over these issues?\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with the decision. The financial burden is a real concern, but is it the right reason to break up? Also, his criticism of her career choice might be based on his own beliefs about science versus alternative medicine.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have addressed these issues earlier in the relationship rather than letting them build up. Maybe communication could have resolved some of the conflicts. However, it's clear they have fundamental disagreements about medical practices, which are hard to reconcile.\n\nIn some cases, career choices and financial responsibilities are valid reasons for breaking up. But when it's based on differing beliefs about science and pseudoscience, it's more about values. The author might feel they can't coexist with opposing views on important matters. But love is supposed to involve accepting each other's differences, within reason.\n\nHowever, if one partner's beliefs could lead to harmful practices, like trusting pseudoscience over evidence-based medicine, that's a legitimate concern. The author fears that her career might endanger patients, which adds an ethical dimension. But is that a valid reason to end a relationship, especially if the partner hasn't acted on those beliefs yet?\n\nThe author is also using money as a reason, which is a materialistic concern. But if he's willing to support her financially, maybe he can adjust. However, if the debt is a significant burden and he's not comfortable with the financial commitment, that's a personal decision.\n\nIn the end, it's complex. The author's decision is based on both financial and ethical concerns. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether these reasons are acceptable for ending a 10-year relationship. Some might argue that he's prioritizing his beliefs over love, while others might see it as a necessary choice for long-term compatibility.\n"
