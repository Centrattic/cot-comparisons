Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her going into $200k debt for school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Love and relationships can be complex. The author is conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile their differing views on medicine and the financial aspect. The girlfriend is passionate about her career choice, which he sees as based on pseudoscience. \n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for differences in core values or life goals to cause issues. Here, the main issues are his belief that her career is based on pseudoscience and the financial burden. However, he also acknowledges that he loves her deeply and is struggling with the decision.\n\nIs it fair to break up over this? On one hand, respecting each other's choices is important. If she's committed to her path and he can't accept it, that's a legitimate reason for incompatibility. On the other hand, if he's dismissing her career choice as pseudoscience without considering her perspective, that might be a problem. Also, using financial reasons as a deal-breaker can be seen as materialistic, but it's a real concern if he's not willing to support that debt.\n\nThe author feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his decision is based on those factors. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough to justify the breakup. While it's true that love involves compromise, there are situations where fundamental disagreements are too much to overcome. However, the way he frames it (calling her field pseudoscience and being concerned about patients potentially dying) adds another layer. He might be prioritizing his values over hers, which could be seen as judgmental.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong for having his beliefs or for making a decision based on them. Relationships require mutual respect and compatibility. If both can't find a middle ground, it's a valid reason to part ways. However, the way he's dismissing her career and the pseudoscience angle might indicate a lack of respect for her choices. But the final decision to break up is a personal one, and while it's painful, it's his prerogative if he feels it's necessary for his own values and future.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (No), because he's not in the wrong. The breakup is due to incompatible life goals, which is a common reason. However, there's a nuance in how he's justifying it, but ultimately, it's his choice based on his values.\n"
