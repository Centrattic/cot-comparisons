Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) because of her beliefs in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author broke up because he disagrees with her career choice, which he associates with pseudoscience. He feels that NDs are not valid, especially when it comes to treating serious illnesses like cancer. He also mentions the financial aspect, 200k debt, which he wouldn't support. \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to choose their career, and love should ideally transcend differences. Maybe the author is overstepping by using the breakup as a reason related to her career beliefs. However, the financial burden is a practical concern. If they were to be together, supporting her through that debt could be a significant commitment. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm (like not seeking MDs for cancer) is a valid ethical concern. If someone is in a position to provide medical advice that could be harmful, that's a real issue. But is it enough to end a 10-year relationship over? \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to balance both sides. The author might be right to prioritize his values regarding science, but breaking up over it could be seen as using material reasons. However, the financial aspect adds another layer. If they planned to be together, supporting her education debt is a big deal. \n\nBut is the breakup justified? Maybe the author felt that their core values were incompatible. The girlfriend is committed to her path, which he disagrees with. In that case, maybe the split is about incompatible life goals, not just money. However, the way he framed the breakup might make him seem dismissive of her choices, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because breaking up over someone's career choice, especially when it's about personal beliefs and with such emotional weight, might be too extreme. However, the financial aspect complicates things. But the main issue is that he prioritized his scientific views over her personal and career choices, which are her rights. So maybe A is correct. Wait, but if he's concerned about her providing harmful advice, that's a safety issue. But the question is about being in the wrong. If he's acting out of concern for her patients' safety, maybe it's more nuanced. However, in a relationship, such a decision to break up based on career and beliefs might be seen as wrong, unless there's direct harm. But the author isn't stopping her from practicing; he's ending the relationship because of their differing views. So maybe he is in the wrong. I'll go with A.\n"
