Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the breakup was because of a fundamental difference in their views on medicine. The girlfriend believes in things like pseudoscience (vaccines causing autism, homeopathy), which the author disagrees with. The author values modern medicine and is concerned about the ND field, thinking that it could be harmful if someone relies on it instead of proper medical treatment. They also mention the financial aspect\u2014around $200k in debt for her ND school, which he would have to support.\n\nNow, the key issues here are: differing beliefs, financial responsibility, and whether it's acceptable to end a relationship over these issues. \n\nOn one hand, love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences. The author says they loved each other a lot, but their visions for the future clashed. The financial burden is a real concern, especially if they were planning to be in a long-term relationship. It's a big commitment to take on someone else's student debt, and that could lead to stress in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being critical of the ND field, which is controversial. ND schools are often seen as not being as rigorous as MD programs. The author is worried that her beliefs could lead to harm, like patients not getting proper medical care. But is that a valid reason to break up? It's a personal belief versus a professional choice. \n\nAlso, the author might be projecting their own values onto the relationship. The girlfriend is pursuing a career she's passionate about, even if he disagrees with her methods. The question is whether it's right to end a relationship because of such fundamental disagreements, especially when it's about career choices and beliefs. \n\nFinancial support is another factor. If the author wasn't willing to take on that debt, it's a legitimate reason to reconsider the relationship, especially if they had discussed future plans and couldn't compromise. However, some might argue that financial issues shouldn't dictate such a major decision, especially if the relationship was otherwise strong.\n\nThe author also feels guilty, which shows internal conflict. They tried to convince themselves it shouldn't matter, but it did. The fact that their friends and family said it shouldn't matter might influence their perspective, but personal compatibility is also important. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on their values and concerns about the future. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether personal beliefs and financial considerations justify ending a long-term relationship. It's a tough call, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they felt they couldn't reconcile these differences. However, some might argue that love should override such disagreements. Still, given the depth of the disagreement and the financial aspect, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author made a decision based on their own values and future considerations, even if it's painful.\n"
