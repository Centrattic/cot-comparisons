Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path due to disagreements about medical practices and financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether it's wrong to break up over differing views on science and career choices. The author is against her ND path because he thinks it's pseudoscience, especially regarding homeopathy and the vaccine-autism link, which are debunked. He also mentions the financial burden of her education.\n\nOn one hand, relationships can be based on shared values. If trust and health beliefs are fundamental, then differing on such important issues might be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author feels that her career could potentially harm patients by relying on unproven methods. This is a serious concern, especially in healthcare, where misinformation can have real consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, love and commitment might suggest that differences can be navigated. The author acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his own values clash with hers. However, using financial support as a reason to break up, especially over a 10-year relationship, could be seen as materialistic. The question is whether his decision was based on valid concerns or fear of being stuck with debt.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of personal freedom. The girlfriend has the right to pursue her career, even if he disagrees. The author might have imposed his beliefs onto her, expecting her to conform. Respect for individual choices is important in relationships. However, if those choices involve harmful practices, it's a different scenario.\n\nThe author's reasoning about pseudoscience leading to harm is a red flag. If he genuinely believes she could endanger patients, that's a serious ethical issue. But if his opposition is more about scientific integrity than actual harm, maybe it's a difference in opinion.\n\nFinancial support is another factor. The author mentions taking on $200k debt. If he felt pressured to fund her education against his will, that could be a problem. But if they discussed it beforehand and he agreed, then it's a different situation. The post suggests he used money as the main argument, which might indicate that his primary issue was financial rather than the career itself.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements about core values can lead to breakups. However, the way the author framed it\u2014using money as the excuse but underlying issues about her career path\u2014might show that he's prioritizing his own values over her aspirations. This could be seen as not supporting her dreams, which is a common reason for conflict.\n\nOverall, the answer depends on balancing respect for individual choices versus preventing potential harm. If the author believes her career is harmful, he might think he's justified. But if it's more about differing opinions without actual harm, then maybe he's wrong to end it. The financial aspect adds another layer. Since the author feels conflicted and others told him it shouldn't matter, it's possible he's overemphasizing material issues. However, his concerns about pseudoscience are valid in a healthcare context. The decision to break up over this is complex and might not be clearly right or wrong, but the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nConsidering the arguments, the author's decision is based on his values, but using money as a reason when the core issue is her career path might indicate he's prioritizing his own beliefs over her happiness. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But if the pseudoscience aspect is a legitimate ethical concern, maybe B (No). However, the line between pseudoscience and alternative medicine can be blurry, and his judgment might be biased. The key is that love should require compromise unless there's actual harm. Since the author is using financial support as a lever, which can be seen as materialistic, the answer is likely A.\n"
