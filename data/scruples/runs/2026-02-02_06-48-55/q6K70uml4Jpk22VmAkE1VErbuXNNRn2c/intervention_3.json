Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and the author has issues with the pseudoscience involved and the financial burden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for the breakup. The author mentions disagreements over the field of study, specifically the belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the rejection of vaccinations. They also bring up the financial aspect, 200k in debt, and the potential for the girlfriend to provide inadequate medical advice, possibly leading to harm.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships often involve accepting each other's differences. The author believes they can't reconcile the fundamental differences in beliefs about medicine. They feel that the girlfriend's choice is based on pseudoscience, which could be a deal-breaker if it affects their values or future plans. The financial burden is a practical concern too; supporting a significant debt might be a strain on their relationship or future together.\n\nOn the other hand, ending a relationship over someone's career choice and beliefs might seem harsh. The author acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views, yet their own stance is based on those factors. The emotional impact is clear\u201410 years together, and the breakup is causing deep pain. The author is conflicted, feeling like they're in the wrong but can't see a way forward.\n\nAnother angle is the validity of the concerns. Naturopathic medicine is a controversial field. While some aspects might overlap with alternative medicine, the rejection of vaccines and homeopathy are scientifically discredited. The author's fear that the girlfriend's work could lead to harmful outcomes is a valid concern if she's advising patients to forgo proven treatments. However, in reality, NDs are regulated in some places, though their practices can vary. The author's sister-in-law graduating from the same school might not reflect the quality of the education or the actual practices of NDs.\n\nThe financial aspect is a significant factor. Supporting a partner through a costly education is a big commitment. If the author feels that this would lead to financial strain or that the debt is unsustainable, that's a legitimate concern. However, is it the right reason to end a long-term relationship? It depends on the couple's values and how they view shared responsibilities. The author might have felt that the financial burden and the career path were incompatible with their own goals and values.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a complex issue. On one hand, they acted on their beliefs and concerns, which they see as important. On the other, ending a 10-year relationship over these issues might be seen as prioritizing material and ideological differences over emotional connection. The author himself feels conflicted, which suggests he's torn between his values and the love for his partner.\n\nIn relationships, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The key is mutual respect and whether the differences can be managed. If the author couldn't accept the girlfriend's career and beliefs, maybe the breakup was inevitable. However, is that making him in the wrong? It's debatable. He did consider the financial and ethical implications, but the way he framed it as \"material\" and \"money\" might downplay the deeper values at stake. Alternatively, using money as a reason could be seen as selfish or shallow, depending on perspective.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified. If the beliefs are causing a fundamental incompatibility and potential harm, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the issue is more about controlling the relationship or not accepting his partner's choices, then he might be. The financial aspect is a practical concern, but using it as the breaking point might be seen as a way to justify a decision rooted in deeper disagreements. The author's own feelings of guilt suggest he's aware that this is a difficult call, but he felt it was necessary.\n"
