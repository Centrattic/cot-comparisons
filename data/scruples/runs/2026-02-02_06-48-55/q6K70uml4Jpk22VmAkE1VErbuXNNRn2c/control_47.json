Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants me to answer A or B, where A means the author is wrong and B means they're not. \n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. The author broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The main issues seem to be her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the connection between vaccines and autism, which the author disagrees with. Also, there's the financial burden of her ND school, which he would have to support. \n\nThe author feels bad about breaking up over these issues, thinking love shouldn't be about money or views on life. But they also feel that their future visions are incompatible. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, and the author worries that she might provide ineffective treatments, leading to harm for patients, especially those with serious conditions like cancer.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Relationships often end over incompatible values or goals. The key here is whether the author's reasons are valid or if they're overstepping. \n\nThe author is concerned about pseudoscience. In medical fields, evidence-based practices are crucial. If the ND field promotes unproven or harmful treatments, that's a legitimate concern, especially for someone who believes in modern medicine. However, the author also mentions that NDs have a place as an alternative, as long as they don't replace standard medicine. So maybe the line is about not compromising on evidence-based practices when it matters most.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. Supporting a partner through expensive education is a significant commitment. If the author feels it's a burden they can't take on, that's a personal choice. But is it fair to break up over money? It depends on both parties' readiness. If the girlfriend wasn't contributing or it's an undue burden, maybe it's a valid reason. However, the author frames it as a material issue, which they regret using as the breaking point.\n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted. They love the girlfriend deeply but can't reconcile their differences. In relationships, partners should support each other's goals unless those goals are harmful. The author's concern is that the ND field might lead to harm if patients rely on pseudoscience. If the girlfriend is committed to a path that the author sees as potentially dangerous, that's a fundamental disagreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be making assumptions about what NDs do. Maybe the girlfriend isn't promoting pseudoscience but is using complementary methods. The author's sister being an ND graduate might not necessarily mean she's harmful. The author's fear could be based on stereotypes rather than reality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup is based on valid concerns about harmful practices and financial sustainability, then it's a tough call. However, if the author is dismissing the girlfriend's career choice without understanding her approach or if the financial argument is a cover for deeper issues, then maybe the author is wrong. \n\nBut the main point is that relationships require mutual respect. If the author can't support the girlfriend's career due to genuine safety concerns, that's a valid reason. However, if the breakup is because the author is unwilling to accept a legitimate career path that the girlfriend is passionate about, then they might be in the wrong. It's a complex situation where both perspectives have merits.\n"
