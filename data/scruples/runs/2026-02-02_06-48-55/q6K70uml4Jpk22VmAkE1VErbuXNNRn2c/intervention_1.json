Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is a breakup because the girlfriend is becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author disagrees with her views on pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccine-autism links.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author broke up because of differing beliefs about medicine and financial reasons (supporting her $200k ND school debt). They mention that love shouldn't be about money or life views but acknowledge it's the case here. The author feels conflicted but justifies it by the pseudoscience angle.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships often end because of irreconcilable differences. The key factors here are:\n\n1. **Belief Systems**: The author values evidence-based medicine, while the girlfriend supports alternative medicine with pseudoscientific claims. This is a core value difference. It's a matter of personal beliefs, but in a relationship, such differences can be significant if they lead to conflict.\n\n2. **Financial Responsibility**: The author is concerned about taking on a large debt for a program he disagrees with. Financial stability is a practical consideration in relationships. If one partner is unwilling to support the other's educational pursuits due to disagreement, it can be a valid reason for separation.\n\n3. **Impact on Patients**: The author fears that NDs might provide ineffective treatments, especially for serious conditions like cancer. This is a concern about public health and ethical responsibility. However, it's also a personal belief about the other's career choice, not a legal or ethical violation.\n\n4. **Communication**: The breakup was due to an argument about money, which the author feels is a material issue. However, if the core issue is a fundamental disagreement on health beliefs, the material aspect might be a symptom of a deeper issue.\n\n5. **Emotional Validity**: Both sides have valid emotions. The author feels wrong for ending a long-term relationship over these issues, but relationships require mutual respect and alignment on important matters. If the author can't reconcile these differences, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up because of differing beliefs isn't inherently wrong, especially if those beliefs affect each other's lives significantly. But using financial support as a leverage point might be seen as using money as a reason to break up, which could be a point against him. On the other hand, if supporting her education would mean compromising his own beliefs and potentially enabling practices he disagrees with, it's a tough call.\n\nIn many cases, AITA threads often see the person who ends the relationship over core beliefs being considered not the asshole, especially if they tried to address it and couldn't reconcile. The author does express guilt and sadness, which suggests he's aware of the emotional impact. However, the use of financial reasons might be a point against him if it's more about money than the beliefs themselves. But given the context of differing core values (science vs. pseudoscience), it's a complex matter.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's ending the relationship due to significant, irreconcilable differences in core beliefs and practical concerns about financial commitment. It's a tough choice, but the decision is based on his own values and the impact on their future. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
