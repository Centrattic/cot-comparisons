Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let's start by looking at the situation he presented. \n\nHe mentions that their breakup is due to differing views on medicine. He's against pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccinations cause autism, which are scientifically debunked. He supports modern medicine but acknowledges that some alternative medicine can be valid. However, he's against NDs because he thinks they're promoting pseudoscience and could harm patients by not using modern medical practices. The main points he brings up are the money involved in her ND school and his inability to support her through that debt, as well as their conflicting views on medical practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether his reasons for breaking up are justified. Relationships often end due to irreconcilable differences, especially when it comes to core values. If the girlfriend's career choice is rooted in beliefs that the author finds harmful, that's a significant issue. He's worried about her potentially providing ineffective treatments to patients, which could lead to real harm. That's a serious concern, even if her intentions are good.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships are supposed to be about supporting each other's dreams. If the author is ending the relationship because of her career choice, even if he has valid concerns about the field, it might seem like he's prioritizing his scientific views over her aspirations. However, if those views are a deal-breaker because they conflict with his ethics, then it's a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nThe financial aspect is another angle. He doesn't want to take on her student debt, which could be a practical reason. But he also frames it as a moral issue because he disagrees with the field itself. So it's both financial and philosophical.\n\nThe question is whether his actions make him in the wrong. If he's ending the relationship because he can't support her career due to genuine ethical concerns, some might see it as him upholding his values. Others might argue that his stance is dismissive of her personal and professional choices, especially if she's passionate about her field. But given that naturopathic medicine is controversial and can sometimes promote harmful practices, his concerns might be legitimate.\n\nHowever, is it right to end a 10-year relationship over this? That's a big call. The author feels regret and sadness, which suggests he values the relationship deeply but felt it was necessary. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reasons are valid and if he handled it respectfully. Since he's expressing his concerns and not attacking her personally but the field's practices, it might be seen as justified. But if he's being closed-minded and not allowing for discussion or compromise, that could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author's reasons are based on his beliefs about science and potential harm, which are valid concerns. However, ending a long-term relationship over this might be seen as harsh. But if the fundamental differences are too great to overcome, it's a personal choice. The answer might hinge on whether his reasons are considered valid and if the breakup was handled appropriately. Given the context, I think the answer leans towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's standing by his values and ethical concerns, even though the situation is difficult.\n"
