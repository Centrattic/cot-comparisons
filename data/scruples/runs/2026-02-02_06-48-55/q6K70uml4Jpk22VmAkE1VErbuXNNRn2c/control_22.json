Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). He's upset because he feels like love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their visions for the future are conflicting. His main issues are her belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism, which he disagrees with, and the financial burden of her ND school, which could add up to $200k. He feels bad about breaking up over money and her career choice, especially since the relationship lasted 10 years.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, love should be about mutual respect and compatibility. If their core values are clashing significantly, like beliefs about health and financial priorities, then maybe it's a valid reason to break up. The author mentions that he can't support her in a field he views as pseudoscientific, which could lead to ethical concerns if she's advising patients. That's a real issue if he can't trust her career choices.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over differing opinions might be hasty. The girlfriend might see her career as important, and the author is prioritizing his beliefs over their relationship. The financial aspect is also a factor. He mentions supporting her through school, which implies financial commitment, but maybe that's a dealbreaker for him. However, is it fair to end a long-term relationship primarily over money and career choice, especially if she's passionate about her work?\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's reasons are justified. If he genuinely believes that her career path could harm others (like if someone chooses an ND over a medical doctor and dies as a result), he might feel ethically obligated to distance himself. But is that a valid reason for a breakup? Also, can't couples work through disagreements with communication and compromise?\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but personal values are important. However, the way he ended the relationship focused on money, which he now feels was the wrong point to use. The emotional impact on both sides is significant. The author is hurting, and so is the girlfriend. It's a tough situation where both might feel wronged.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author's reasoning is based on his values and concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden, but breaking up a long-term relationship over these issues might be seen as harsh. However, if the core values are irreconcilable, it's understandable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal perspectives. But given the setup, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's ending the relationship over issues that might not be dealbreakers for everyone, and the focus on money and career could be seen as materialistic. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the pseudoscience aspect is a dealbreaker for him, then maybe B (not in the wrong). I need to weigh the ethical implications versus the relationship.\n"
