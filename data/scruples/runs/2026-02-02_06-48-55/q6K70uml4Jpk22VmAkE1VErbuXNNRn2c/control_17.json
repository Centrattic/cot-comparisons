Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with her views on pseudoscience like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. The author feels conflicted because they love each other, but their differing views on medicine led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values scientific evidence and is concerned about the girlfriend's beliefs in pseudoscience, which they see as harmful, especially when she wants to work with cancer patients. The girlfriend is committed to her path, even though it involves significant debt. The author's main reasons for breaking up are the financial burden and the ideological differences about medical practices.\n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship because of core belief differences? Relationships often require compromise, but there can be valid reasons to part ways if the differences are irreconcilable. However, using financial aspects as the main argument when the real issue is the field she's entering might complicate things. The author mentions that their love is strong but their visions for the future are incompatible.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm of pseudoscience. If the author genuinely believes that her career path could lead to harmful practices (like relying on placebos instead of evidence-based treatments), that's a serious ethical concern. But is it fair to end a relationship based on that, or should they have addressed it earlier through counseling or open dialogue?\n\nThe financial aspect is also a factor. The author mentions 200k debt, which is a significant burden. If he's not willing to support her financially due to his opposition to her career, that could be seen as using money as a leverage point rather than addressing the core beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships should ideally transcend such issues, but sometimes people can't reconcile fundamental differences. The author is struggling with guilt, feeling like they're in the wrong. But if the core issue is about health beliefs that could affect others, maybe his decision is justified.\n\nHowever, using the financial argument as the final straw might be a way to avoid addressing the deeper issue. The author might have felt that they couldn't support her career choice, leading to the breakup. It's possible that the author is not wrong if the relationship had irreparable differences that they tried to address, but if they didn't make an effort to understand each other's perspectives fully, that could be a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the breakup was a result of genuine incompatibility or if other factors (like financial pressure) were used as an excuse. Since relationships are complex, but the author did express love and care, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the decision to break up over core beliefs that one cannot compromise on isn't necessarily wrong if all else fails.\n"
