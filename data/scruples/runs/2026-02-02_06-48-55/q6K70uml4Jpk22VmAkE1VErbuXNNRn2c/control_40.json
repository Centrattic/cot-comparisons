Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs, like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy being effective. He mentions that their visions for the future are different and he's not okay with her going into a field that he thinks is based on pseudoscience, even though he acknowledges that NDs might have a place as an alternative. He also brings up the financial aspect of her $200k debt for school, which he says he would have to support her through. His friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he still feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the breakup. The main issue seems to be their differing views on alternative vs. modern medicine. The author is concerned that his girlfriend is promoting practices that are not scientifically valid, which he feels is risky, especially if patients might die because they rely on NDs instead of MDs. On the other hand, he also brings up financial support as a factor. So the question is whether his reasons are justified in the context of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, love is often supposed to be about accepting the person for who they are. But relationships also involve shared values and future planning. The author is worried about the financial burden, which is a real concern. However, breaking up over her career choice and beliefs might be more about their incompatibility in core values rather than just material issues. \n\nThe girlfriend's beliefs in pseudoscience are a significant red flag, especially if she's going to be in a healthcare field. The author is concerned that her practices could be harmful, particularly if she advises cancer patients against conventional medicine. This isn't just about personal preference; it could affect other people's health and safety. But then again, maybe the author overestimated her actual approach. For example, she might not outright reject all modern medicine but use it as a complement. However, the author's example of her giving up on modern practices in favor of pseudoscience is a strong point. \n\nThe financial aspect is another layer. The author is worried about taking on $200k in debt, which is a lot. But is that a valid reason to break up? It's common for relationships to have disagreements about finances, and support can be a big part of a partnership. However, if the author isn't willing to support her career choice because of the debt, and that's a deal-breaker for him, it's part of their compatibility. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are justified. If the girlfriend's career choice is based on harmful misinformation, and the author can't accept that, maybe it's not his fault. On the flip side, if he's being too rigid and the debt is the real issue, that's different. The post says he feels like a \"total ass hat,\" indicating he's conflicted. His friends say it shouldn't matter, but he's not convinced. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, love and relationships are complex. If the core issue is her belief in pseudoscience that could lead to harmful practices, and he can't reconcile that with his values, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's prioritizing financial and ideological differences over a long-term relationship, others might see that as being in the wrong. The answer depends on the severity of the incompatibility. Since the girlfriend's field involves health decisions that could impact others, the author's concern might be valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
