There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that this guy walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and then refused to leave. There are a few points to consider here.\n\nFirst, the flatmate has been having loud sex multiple times, which is disturbing the other tenants. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but nothing changed. The author and his roommates are frustrated because they have exams and early starts. So the context is that there's a history of this behavior, and the others feel it's affecting their well-being and studies.\n\nNow, the key issue is that the author walked into her room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space while they're having sex is a serious invasion of privacy. Legally, in many places, entering someone's room without their consent, even if it's unlocked, could be considered trespassing or violating privacy. The act of having sex in a private room is something that people expect to be private, even if the door was left unlocked. So the author's action of entering the room is a significant breach.\n\nThen, after entering, he confronts them, yells at her, threatens the guy with calling security, and tells her to move out. This is aggressive behavior. Even if the others were upset, responding with anger and confrontation could escalate the situation. The guy was just there for sex and might not have been involved in the ongoing issues, so threatening him might not be justified. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was the right thing to do. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if motivated by frustration. The fact that he didn't ask for permission to enter and instead barged in, regardless of the noise issue, is a problem. Privacy rights are important, and even if the others were disturbed, entering the room without consent is a violation.\n\nSo, even though the situation is understandable from the author's perspective, the method he used to address the problem was inappropriate. He should have tried to resolve the issue without invading her privacy. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
