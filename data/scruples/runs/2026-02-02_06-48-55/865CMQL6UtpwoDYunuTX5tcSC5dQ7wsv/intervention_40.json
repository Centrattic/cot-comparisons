There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (20M) who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The answer needs to be A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: the flatmate is having loud sex multiple times, disturbing others. They tried talking and called security, but it didn't help. Then, the author decides to confront her by entering her room when she's having sex again. The door was unlocked, so he walks in. The flatmates support him.\n\nNow, the key points here are privacy and consent. Even if the flatmate was being loud and annoying, entering someone's room without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The author might have been frustrated, but that doesn't justify walking in uninvited. The act of entering another person's private space without permission is a significant issue. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to barge in, especially during intimate moments. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which is a serious matter. Additionally, threatening the guy with calling security and using others as backup adds another layer of confrontation. While the flatmates are supportive, the act itself is ethically questionable. So, considering all these factors, the answer would be A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy.\n"
