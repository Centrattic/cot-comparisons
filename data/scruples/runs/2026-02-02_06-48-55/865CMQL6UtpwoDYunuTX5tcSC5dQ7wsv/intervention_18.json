There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: The flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which the others find disturbing. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author decides to confront her by entering her room when she's having sex again, leading to a confrontation where the author tells the guy to leave and says harsh things to the flatmate. The flatmates support the author, but the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, privacy is a big factor here. Even if someone's behavior is annoying, entering someone's room without permission is a violation of their privacy. The author had the right to be upset about the noise, but the way he addressed it was by intruding on her private moment. Legally and ethically, entering someone's room when they're having sex is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. \n\nEven though the others supported him, that doesn't make the action right. The author could have used other methods, like talking to her again, setting boundaries, or maybe seeking more formal mediation. Using force by entering her room, especially when she didn't let him in initially, crosses a line. \n\nAlso, the author's response was aggressive. Telling the man to leave and threatening to call security with others backing him up might have been an escalation. The man left, but the situation could have been more confrontational than necessary. The author's harsh language towards the flatmate, saying she needs to leave, adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even if the author was trying to stand up for himself and others, the method was inappropriate. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
