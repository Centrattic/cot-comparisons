There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, walking into someone's private room without permission, especially when they're engaged in intimate activity, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is likely an invasion of privacy. The fact that the person was in the middle of having sex adds another layer here. Legally, there might be issues related to voyeurism or intrusion.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The flatmate had previously been loud, disturbing others, and wasn't responsive to requests to be quieter. However, the response of entering her room and confronting them is extreme. While the others were annoyed, using force or confrontation without considering other options (like talking to her again, moving to another part of the house, or using earplugs) might not be the best approach. \n\nThe man who was there might not have been a threat, and the way the author handled it by threatening to call security with others backing them up could be seen as aggressive. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying, calling the author names) suggests that the intrusion was very hurtful. \n\nThe other flatmates' agreement with the author's actions is noted, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Group support doesn't negate individual responsibility for violating someone's privacy. \n\nSo, even though the author had frustrations, the method of dealing with it by intruding on a private moment is problematic. There are better ways to handle conflicts without violating someone's personal space. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
