There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy (20M) lives with five others, including a girl (20F) who often brings guys home for loud sex. They've tried telling her to keep it down and even contacted security, but nothing worked. Now, she's doing it again at 2am when he needs to wake up early for an exam. He bangs on her door, but she doesn't open. He tries the door, finds it unlocked, walks in, sees them having sex, tells the guy to leave, and after the guy leaves, he tells her to move out. She's upset and calls him names. The flatmates support him.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From what I know, entering someone's private space without permission is generally a no-go. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in when they're having sex is a privacy violation. The guy might feel it's necessary because of the noise, but that doesn't justify entering without consent. Also, threatening to call security and using others as leverage could be seen as aggressive. Even if the flatmates agree with him, it doesn't make it right. Privacy rights are important, and there are more appropriate ways to address noise issues, like using earplugs, talking to the person in a respectful manner, or seeking mediation. The act of entering the room, regardless of intent, is a breach of privacy. So, I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
