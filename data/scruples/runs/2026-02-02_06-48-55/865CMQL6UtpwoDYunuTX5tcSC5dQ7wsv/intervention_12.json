There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others. There's a female flatmate who brings guys home and has loud sex, which disrupts their rest. The others have asked her to be quieter, even contacted security, but it didn't help. One night, he walks into her room while she's having sex with someone, tells them to leave, and the guy does. She gets upset and calls him names. The others support him.\n\nFirst, the act of walking into someone's room without permission is a privacy issue. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to enter uninvited. Privacy rights are important, and interrupting someone during a private activity is a big deal. The author's intention was to stop the noise, but his method was invasive. \n\nAlso, the guy in the story was threatening to call security and using the flatmates as support. That sounds like power dynamics and potential coercion. The guy who left was probably scared because of the threat. Even if the author was frustrated, threatening someone with security or group support might be considered harassment. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with him, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's right. Just because others are upset doesn't justify violating someone's privacy. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which is a serious matter. Even if the girl was noisy, the solution shouldn't involve entering her room without consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl was disruptive and ignored warnings. The author's motivation was understandable, but the method was wrong. There might have been other ways to address the problem, like talking to her directly or using formal complaints. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a breach of privacy, which makes him at fault. The answer is A.\n"
