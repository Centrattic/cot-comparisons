There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a shared flat with five others, a girl who's been having loud sex multiple times, and the author's reaction after telling her to keep it down without success. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The flatmate's actions are disruptive, affecting others' sleep and study time. They've tried to address it through the flat chat and even contacted security, but there's been no resolution. The author then decides to confront the situation directly by entering the room uninvited. \n\nNow, the ethical issues here. Privacy is a big one. Even if the flatmate was being loud, entering someone's room without their consent and interrupting a private act could be seen as a violation of their privacy. The author might argue that the noise was a disturbance, but the method they used\u2014storming in and berating them\u2014could be crossing a line. \n\nNext, the author's actions. They barged in, used aggressive language, threatened to call security, and made the flatmate cry. While the others thanked the author, that doesn't necessarily mean the action was appropriate. It might be more about the relief from the noise rather than the method used. \n\nLegal aspects could be relevant too. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're in a private act, might have legal consequences. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't give you the right to enter without being invited. The flatmate might have a case against the author for invasion of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the guy. Telling him to leave and threatening to call security with others backing up could be seen as intimidation. The guy might have felt humiliated or harassed, even if he left. The author's language was hostile and aggressive, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. \n\nThen, the aftermath. The flatmate is upset, and the author is now seeking validation. The fact that the others agreed and thanked him is a factor, but it's important to note that group consensus doesn't make a questionable action right. They might be more concerned about the immediate problem (noise) than the privacy issue.\n\nPossible alternatives for the author: Instead of entering the room, they could have used a louder soundproofing method, like using white noise machines, or perhaps installed thicker curtains. They might have considered talking to the flatmate directly in a non-confrontational way, maybe setting up a quiet time agreement. Also, escalating to university housing authorities might have been an option if security didn't help.\n\nThe author's right to privacy was also violated by the flatmate's loud behavior, but the solution they chose to implement likely violated the flatmate's privacy. It's a balance between respecting each other's rights. While the noise was a problem, the author's approach was confrontational and potentially illegal. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they intruded on the flatmate's privacy, used aggressive language, and threatened others, which are serious issues despite the valid complaint about noise. The answer should be A.\n"
