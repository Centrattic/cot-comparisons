There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 20M living in a shared flat with 5 others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex with partners. The flatmates have complained, even to security, but it's continued. This time, when she does it again, the author goes into her room, sees them in the act, and demands the guy leave, then tells the girl to move out.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and consent. When someone is having sex, even if they're loud or disrupting shared space, walking into their room without permission is a violation of their privacy. The author claims the door was unlocked, but entering without consent is still an invasion. The guy was there consensually with the flatmate, so confronting him and forcing him out could be seen as overstepping. \n\nEven if the author and others are annoyed, the method used was inappropriate. The flatmate had the right to privacy, and the author's actions could lead to legal issues like assault or invasion of privacy. The flatmates might be supportive, but that doesn't make it right. The author acted without considering legal boundaries and the right to privacy, even if the situation was frustrating.\n\nAlso, the author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could escalate the situation. While the flatmate is a problem, the solution wasn't appropriate. The correct approach would be to document the issue, maybe find a mediator, or involve higher authorities if security didn't help. \n\nSo, even though the flatmate was causing disturbance, the author's actions were a breach of privacy and possibly illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
