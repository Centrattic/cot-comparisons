There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after walking into their flatmate's room during a sexual act and refusing to leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their flatmates are annoyed by the girl's loud sex, have asked her to be quieter, and even reported to security without success. The author decides to confront the situation by entering the room when it's unlocked, catches them in the act, and demands the guy leave. The flatmates support the author, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, entering someone's private space without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily make it okay to intrude, especially during a private act. The author had a right to be upset about the noise, but the method of resolution was aggressive and invasive. The use of threats and the confrontation could be seen as bullying or harassment. The guy's reaction and the girl's emotional response suggest that the author's actions were over the top.\n\nEthically, while the author might have felt justified due to the ongoing disturbance, the way they handled it\u2014storming in, yelling, threatening to call security, and humiliating the girl\u2014crosses boundaries. Even if the flatmates agree, others might argue that the author's actions were not the appropriate way to address the issue. The correct approach would be to report the issue through proper channels or find non-intrusive solutions, not to take matters into their own hands in such a confrontational manner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy and used intimidation, even if their initial complaint was valid.\n"
