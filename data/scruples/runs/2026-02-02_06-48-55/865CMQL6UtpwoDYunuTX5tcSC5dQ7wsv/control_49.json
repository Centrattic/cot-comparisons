There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The flatmate is having loud sex multiple times, disturbing others. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her. They bang on the door, it's unlocked, and they walk in just as she's having sex. Then they tell the guy to leave and confront the flatmate.\n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without permission is a privacy issue. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent could be considered a violation. The right to privacy is generally respected unless there's an emergency. Here, the author's main complaint is noise, which others had already tried to address. However, the response involved intruding on a private moment, which might cross a line.\n\nMorally, the situation is tricky. The flatmates are disturbed, and they've tried other avenues like talking to her and security. But the author's reaction is immediate and confrontational. The act of entering the room and confronting them during sex could be seen as escalating the conflict. Even if others agree with the action, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author used force (bangging on the door, entering) and made threats. The guy being asked to leave could lead to legal issues if he feels harassed.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to address a repeated problem that others were also suffering. They might feel it was a necessary step to get peace. The flatmates' support shows they felt it was justified. But the method\u2014entering without consent\u2014could be problematic regardless of intent.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, unless there's an explicit invitation or a legal authority (like a landlord), entering someone's private space without permission is a violation. Even if the door is unlocked, the occupant's right to privacy is still in place. The author's actions could lead to charges of trespassing or violation of privacy, depending on local laws.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author did overstep by entering the room without consent. Even if the situation was frustrating, there are more appropriate methods to address the issue, like formal complaints, moving to a different living arrangement, or using legal channels. The immediate, confrontational approach, while possibly well-intentioned, is likely to be seen as the wrong action here. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
