There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the person (20M) walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to think about the situation from different angles.\n\nFirst, the flatmate's privacy. Even if she's being loud and disruptive, entering someone's room without permission when they're having sex is a big privacy violation. That's a major point. People generally have the right to privacy in their own rooms, especially during intimate moments. So the author's actions here could be considered a violation of that right.\n\nThen there's the noise issue. The flatmates have tried to address the problem before, like telling her to keep it down and involving security, but nothing worked. The author's frustration is understandable, but does that justify walking into her room? Maybe not. There are other ways to handle the noise, like using earplugs, white noise machines, or maybe even legal steps if the problem persists. But storming in uninvited is a different matter.\n\nAlso, the author confronted the situation in a confrontational way. Threatening the guy with security and mentioning other flatmates as backup might be intimidating. Even if the guy left, the way the author handled it could be seen as aggressive. The flatmate was clearly upset and felt violated, which is a valid reaction given the circumstances.\n\nAnother point is the author's own behavior. They admitted they were angry and said harsh things. Even if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the method of dealing with it was extreme. The author could have handled it differently, like knocking and asking them to lower the volume, but instead chose to barge in. That's a key point against them.\n\nThe flatmates' reaction is also a factor. They thanked the author, but that might be more about relief from the noise rather than justifying the invasion of privacy. Group dynamics can sometimes lead to others supporting aggressive actions even if they're not entirely right.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author violated someone's privacy, acted aggressively, and the resolution was confrontational. Even though the underlying issue (noise) was a problem, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
