There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, the situation: The flatmate has a history of having loud sex that disturbs everyone. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but nothing changed. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her by entering her room without permission when she's in the middle of having sex again.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Even if someone is doing something the others dislike, entering someone's room without their consent is a violation of privacy. The flatmate had a right to privacy in her own room, regardless of her behavior. The author's actions were intrusive.\n\nNext, the method used. The author didn't give the couple a chance to stop or leave; he just walked in and confronted them. This could be seen as an aggressive action. Even if the others supported him, it's not right to take matters into one's own hands like that. There might have been safer ways to handle the disturbance, like using earplugs or talking to the university again.\n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned having others back him up. That could be seen as intimidation. The couple might feel they have no recourse, but in reality, the author could be at fault for trespassing and harassment.\n\nThe flatmate's reaction is understandable\u2014she was in her room, having private time, and someone entered without permission. The author's response, while perhaps motivated by frustration, doesn't justify the invasion of privacy. The flatmates agreeing with him doesn't change the fact that he violated her privacy.\n\nSo, even though the other flatmates are grateful, the author did something that's likely against the rules of the shared living space and infringes on someone else's rights. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
