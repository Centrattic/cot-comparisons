There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. So first, I need to break down the key points here.\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old male living in a shared flat with five others. There's a female flatmate who regularly brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've tried asking her to keep it down, even told security, but it didn't help. Then, in this specific incident, the author walks into her room during another loud session. The door was unlocked, so he enters, sees them having sex, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and threatens to call security. The girl gets upset and calls him names, and the others agree with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but they want to know if the model agrees. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, entering someone's room without permission could be considered a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is generally not okay. Privacy is a key aspect here, especially in shared living spaces. People have a right to privacy in their own rooms, regardless of the noise. The author's actions might be seen as an invasion of that privacy.\n\nSecond, the method of dealing with the issue seems aggressive. Instead of finding a non-confrontational way to address the noise\u2014like talking to her privately or involving a mediator\u2014he took matters into his own hands. Shouting and threatening to call security with other flatmates could escalate the situation. Even if the others were annoyed, this approach might not be the most appropriate. The author's language was confrontational and disrespectful, which could add to the problem.\n\nThird, the consequences: the girl was crying, and the guy left out of fear. The author's actions led to a hostile confrontation, which might have damaged relationships in the flat. Even though the flatmates agreed with him, that doesn't necessarily make it right. Groupthink can sometimes lead to poor decisions, especially when it involves others' privacy and personal space.\n\nHowever, there's a point about the noise disturbance. If the flatmate was consistently violating the others' peace, there's some justification for frustration. But the way he handled it was problematic. The door being unlocked doesn't justify walking in uninvited. The author should have used other means to address the noise issue, like setting boundaries or finding a solution with the group without invading her privacy.\n\nIn terms of university housing policies, walking into someone's room without permission could be against the rules. Universities usually have guidelines about respecting others' privacy. The author might have violated those policies, leading to potential disciplinary action.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy was a stranger to the flat and might not be welcome, but the author's approach was confrontational. Maybe involving a more neutral party, like a housing officer, would have been better. Also, the author's threat to call security and have others back him up could be seen as bullying, using group power against an individual.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the motivation was to address the noise problem, the method used was inappropriate. The author did enter the room without consent, which is a privacy violation, and the confrontation was aggressive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
