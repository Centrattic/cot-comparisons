There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five other people, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys back and has loud sex. The others have told her to keep it down, even contacted security, but it's not stopping. The author is annoyed because they have exams and need to sleep. One night, when she's having loud sex again at 2 AM, he goes to her door, bangs on it, and when she doesn't open it, he enters because it's unlocked. He walks in while they're having sex, tells the guy to leave, threatens to call security, and tells the girl to move out. She's upset, they argue, and he leaves. The others supported him.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the key issue is walking into her room while she's having sex. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is a privacy violation. The girl has a right to privacy in her own room, even if the noise is disturbing others. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, crossed a line. Threatening the guy and telling the girl to move out might be confrontational and possibly aggressive.\n\nEven if the flatmates are annoyed and have tried other avenues (like talking to her and security), physically entering her room and confronting them in that situation is not an appropriate response. There are legal and social implications. In many places, walking in on someone during intimacy, even if accidentally, can lead to charges like invasion of privacy or assault, depending on how it's handled. The author's refusal to leave after entering is a problem. Also, threatening the guy with security and using others as backup could be seen as intimidation.\n\nWhile the noise disturbance is a valid issue, the method of addressing it was extreme. The author should have considered other solutions, like installing soundproofing, using white noise machines, or discussing it again with the flatmate in a calmer setting. Confronting the situation in the heat of the moment by storming into the room is not justified, regardless of prior frustrations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author violated someone's privacy, acted aggressively, and used intimidation. Even if others agreed with him, it's not the right approach. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
