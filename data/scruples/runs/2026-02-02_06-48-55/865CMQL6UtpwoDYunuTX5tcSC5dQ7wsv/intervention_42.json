There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (20M) is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: the flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which the flatmates find disruptive, especially with exams and early starts. They've tried communicating through the flat chat and even involved security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, goes to her room when she's having sex again, finds the door unlocked, enters, sees them, and confronts both the flatmate and the guy. He ends up getting the guy to leave and tells the flatmate to move out. She reacts angrily, and the author's flatmates support him.\n\nNow, the key points. The author entered a private space without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without their consent is a privacy violation. Consent to enter isn't implied just because the door is unlocked. The act of walking in on someone having sex is a serious invasion of privacy. Legally, this could be considered voyeurism or harassment, depending on jurisdiction. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, which is understandable, but the method was confrontational and invasive. The response\u2014threatening the guy and telling him to leave\u2014could be seen as intimidation. Even if the flatmates agreed with him, that doesn't make the action right. The author's actions escalated the situation, leading to emotional distress for the flatmate. \n\nThere are better ways to address the issue, like installing soundproofing, using earplugs, or seeking mediation. The author's approach was aggressive and crossed boundaries. Privacy rights are important, and violating them, even in frustration, is a breach of trust and mutual respect in a shared living space.\n\nSo, while the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the author's response was inappropriate and violated her privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
