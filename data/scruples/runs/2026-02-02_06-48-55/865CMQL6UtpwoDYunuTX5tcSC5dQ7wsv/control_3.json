There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during an intimate moment is in the wrong. The situation involves loud sex at night causing disturbance, and the author taking matters into their own hands by entering the room without permission.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Even if the flatmate was being disruptive, entering someone's room without their consent is a violation of their privacy. That's a big no-no. The author mentions that the door was unlocked, but that doesn't necessarily justify walking in. People have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their own room, even if they're doing something others disagree with.\n\nNext, there's the aspect of property rules. The user tried to contact security before, but they didn't help. However, taking direct action by confronting the flatmate in such a manner could lead to legal issues. The author used threats and potentially aggressive language, which might be seen as harassment or assault, depending on jurisdiction. The guy who was there might have a case if he feels threatened.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author and the other flatmates could have tried more peaceful methods, like setting house rules or using a mediator. Instead, they escalated the situation by using force and confrontation, which might backfire if the flatmate decides to take legal action.\n\nThe flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't make the action right. Consent and respecting boundaries are important regardless of the majority opinion. The author's actions could lead to a hostile living environment and potential legal trouble, even if the flatmates are on their side.\n\nIn summary, while the flatmate's behavior was disruptive, the author's response violated the other person's privacy and used aggressive tactics, which is likely to be seen as wrong.\n"
