There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate is reportedly loud, and others are annoyed. They tried talking to her, even contacted security, but nothing worked. Then the author decides to confront her by entering the room during sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, entering someone's private space without consent, especially when they're having sex, could be considered a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without permission might still be illegal or at least a serious breach of trust and social norms.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author was disturbed by the noise and had exams coming up. But responding by storming into the room and demanding others leave might be seen as an overreaction. Even if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the author's actions disrupted the other person's privacy and could be considered invasive. \n\nThe author mentions that the guy left when told, but the initial entry into the room was without permission. The flatmate's right to privacy versus the author's right to a quiet living environment. However, there's a difference between being annoyed and taking matters into your own hands in a way that invades someone else's privacy. \n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned having others back them up, which might be seen as bullying. The flatmate was crying and upset, which suggests the action was traumatic for her. Even if others agreed with the author, that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nSo, while the flatmate had issues with noise, the author's method of dealing with it was likely inappropriate. They should have found another way to address the problem, maybe through formal channels or finding a mutual agreement on quiet hours. Breaking into someone's room during private activity is a significant overstep. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
