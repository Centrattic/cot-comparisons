There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man walking into his flatmate's room during an intimate moment and refusing to leave. The flatmate is a woman who's been having loud sex frequently, which has annoyed the other flatmates. They tried telling her and even contacted security, but nothing changed. The author, frustrated, went into her room, saw them having sex, told the guy to leave, and threatened consequences if he didn't. The flatmate got upset, and the author's roommates supported him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is walking into someone's room without permission, especially during a private act. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited is a privacy violation. The author had a valid grievance with the noise, but how he addressed it was problematic. Threatening to call security and using confrontation could be seen as aggressive. The guy left because he was threatened, which might be justified in the author's eyes, but the act of entering the room is still crossing a line.\n\nThe flatmates agreed with the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's right. Privacy rights are important, and even if someone is disturbing others, confronting them in such an intrusive way is not the solution. The author could have tried other measures, like mediation or further communication, instead of storming into the room. The fact that the door was unlocked might reduce the severity, but it doesn't eliminate the wrongdoing. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the frustration, still violated the flatmate's privacy. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
