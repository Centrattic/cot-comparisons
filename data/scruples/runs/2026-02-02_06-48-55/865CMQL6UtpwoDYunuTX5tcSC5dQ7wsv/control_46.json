There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including another girl who's described as problematic. She brings guys back and has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've asked her to keep it down and even reported to security, but nothing changed. Now, the author, who has an early start, is annoyed again when she has sex at 2am. He bangs on her door, she doesn't open, so he enters because it's unlocked. He walks in while they're having sex, tells them to stop, gets the guy to leave, and then confronts her. She reacts by shouting and crying, and he tells her to move out. His flatmates agree with him and thanked him.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether walking into her room while she's having sex and refusing to leave is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, walking into someone's private room without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent when they're engaged in private activity is problematic. The author did this to address noise complaints, but privacy rights are important. \n\nSecond, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping. He interrupted their intimate moment, which is a serious invasion of privacy. Even if the others were upset about the noise, confronting them in that way is not the appropriate method. \n\nThird, the guy's reaction: the author threatened to call security and mentioned having four flatmates to back him up. This could be seen as intimidation. The guy left after the threat, which might be a form of coercion. \n\nHowever, the other flatmates supported the author, saying they thanked him. They might feel that the noise was a bigger issue than their privacy. But from a legal standpoint, entering someone's private space without permission is generally not allowed. In many jurisdictions, even if the door is unlocked, it's still illegal to enter without permission during a private activity.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response was aggressive, using strong language and threatening the guy. This could be seen as harassment or assault, depending on local laws. The fact that the flatmates agreed with him doesn't necessarily make it right; legal standards are objective, not based on what others think.\n\nSo, while the noise issue is valid, the method used to address it was inappropriate. The author invaded someone's privacy, used threats, and acted in a confrontational manner. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
