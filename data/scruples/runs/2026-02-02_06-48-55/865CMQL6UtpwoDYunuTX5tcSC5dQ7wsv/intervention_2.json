There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong after walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a shared living space where loud noises are disrupting others, and the author took a confrontational approach to address it.\n\nFirst, the flatmate in question had already brought guys back multiple times, leading to complaints and even a report to security without resolution. The author mentions that they were trying to get some rest for an early start, and this time they decided to take action. They went to the flatmate's room, entered when the door was unlocked, saw her and another guy having sex, and then verbally confronted both, eventually leading the guy to leave under threat of involving security.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, entering someone's private space without their consent, especially when they're engaged in private activities, could be considered a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give others the right to enter. The act of walking in on someone during intimacy is generally seen as a serious breach of privacy. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason.\n\nAdditionally, the confrontation escalated with threats and verbal abuse. The author used aggressive language, called the flatmate a \"piece of shit,\" and told her to leave the flat, which could be considered harassment or intimidation. The fact that other flatmates agreed with the author might show that there was a collective frustration, but that doesn't justify illegal or disrespectful actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmate's behavior (bringing guys over and having loud sex despite complaints) disrupted the living environment. The author might feel that their actions were necessary to protect their own interests and those of their flatmates. However, the method used was not appropriate. They should have found a non-intrusive way to address the issue, such as using a doorstop to block the door, using earplugs, or again escalating the complaint through proper channels rather than confronting them directly.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, if this were to go to court, the author could potentially face charges related to invasion of privacy or harassment. The flatmate might have grounds to take legal action, especially if she felt threatened or violated. However, the other flatmates' support might provide some defense, but it's not a legal justification.\n\nEthically, while the author's frustration is understandable, the method of dealing with the problem was inappropriate. There are more respectful and legal ways to handle such situations without violating someone's privacy or using threats.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did violate the flatmate's privacy and used aggressive tactics, which makes them at least partially responsible for the conflict. The correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
