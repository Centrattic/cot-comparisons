There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The flatmate is bringing guys home and having loud sex, which is disturbing everyone else. The author and others have tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. This time, the author went into her room without permission, saw them having sex, and told the guy to leave, which he did. The flatmate was upset and called the author names.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Walking into someone's room without their consent, even if there's a reason, is a violation of their privacy. The author had a valid complaint about the noise and the disturbance, but entering the room without permission is a separate problem. \n\nEven if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to enter without being invited. The couple was having sex, which is a private activity. The author's actions could be seen as intruding on their privacy, which is a serious matter. \n\nAdditionally, threatening the guy with calling security and using the flatmates' support might be intimidation. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could escalate the situation. \n\nHowever, the context is that the author and others were repeatedly disturbed, and they felt they had no other recourse. The flatmates supported the author afterward, which suggests they felt it was justified in this case. But legally and ethically, entering someone's room without permission is a breach of privacy. \n\nIn many places, people have the right to privacy in their own rooms, even in shared housing. The author's solution might have been an overreaction, even if the underlying issue was valid. The appropriate steps would be to continue reporting the issue through proper channels rather than taking matters into one's own hands. \n\nSo, while the author had a legitimate grievance, the method of addressing it by entering the room and confronting them directly is problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of violating privacy, even if they were trying to solve a problem.\n"
