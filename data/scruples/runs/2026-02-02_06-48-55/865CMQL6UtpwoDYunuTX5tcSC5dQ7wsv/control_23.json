There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. The author is a 20-year-old male in a flat with five others. The problem is the girl bringing guys over and having loud sex repeatedly, despite warnings. The author, after being annoyed multiple times, finally goes into her room, sees them having sex, and confronts the guy, making him leave. The girl is upset, and the others agree with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author entered a private space without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in. Privacy is a big deal, especially in such an intimate situation. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, invaded someone else's privacy. \n\nThen, the confrontation: the author told the guy to leave and threatened to call security. The guy left, but the author's words might be seen as aggressive or intimidating. The girl was also yelled at, which is unkind.\n\nThe flatmates agree with the author, but that doesn't mean the actions were right. The author could have handled it differently, like talking to the girl privately, maybe involving a mediator, or using another method to address the noise without invading her privacy. \n\nLegally and ethically, entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a breach of privacy. The author's response was impulsive and confrontational, which escalates the situation. Even if the girl was inconsiderate about the noise, the author's method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they invaded privacy and used aggressive behavior instead of a more appropriate solution.\n"
