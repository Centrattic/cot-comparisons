There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate is described as loud during sex, which has been a recurring issue, and the author decided to confront her by entering the room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is invasion of privacy. Even if the flatmate was being loud, entering her room without her consent is a breach of her privacy. The author had a history of the problem, had already asked her through the flat chat, and when ignored, decided to go in. But the act itself is a problem because you can't just walk into someone's room like that, regardless of the noise. \n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author used aggressive language, called the girl a \"piece of shit,\" and threatened to call security. The guy left because of the threat, which is more about coercion than actually solving the problem. The flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. \n\nThe author might argue that it was a necessary action to stop the noise, but the method used was extreme. There are other ways to handle loud neighbors, like using a white noise machine, earplugs, or even legal means if the noise is a violation of the lease. The idea of using \"our words against yours\" suggests a power dynamic, which isn't a valid justification for such an intrusion. \n\nAlso, the fact that the room was unlocked doesn't give permission to enter. If someone forgets to lock their door, it's a security risk, but the author took advantage of that to confront them, which is not acceptable. The emotional impact on the flatmate is significant here\u2014she was crying and upset. Even if she's the one causing the noise, the author's response was confrontational and disrespectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a clear violation of privacy and handled with inappropriate aggression. The correct approach would have been to find a non-intrusive solution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
