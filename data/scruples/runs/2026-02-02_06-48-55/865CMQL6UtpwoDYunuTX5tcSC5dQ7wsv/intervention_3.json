There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a university flat with multiple people sharing a space. The flatmate brings guys back and has loud sex, which the others find annoying. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her again.\n\nSo, first, entering someone's room without permission is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if they left the door unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in uninvited. The author mentions it was 2 AM and they needed to get up early. The key point here is the act of entering the room while the flatmate was having sex. Legally, in many places, walking in on someone during a private act like sex could be considered a violation of privacy, even in a shared living space. There might be laws against voyeurism or intrusion. \n\nThe author then berates the flatmate and the other person, threatening to call security and using aggressive language. The flatmate reacts emotionally, and the author leaves, claiming the others supported their actions. But even if others agree, does that make it right? Privacy rights are important, and the author's actions, while perhaps understandable due to stress and frustration, crossed a line. \n\nPossible consequences could include legal issues if the flatmate presses charges for invasion of privacy or assault. Even if not legal, it's a serious breach of trust and could lead to a hostile living environment. The author might have been justified in wanting to address the noise, but the method was extreme and inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because entering the room without consent, especially during a private act, violates the flatmate's privacy, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
