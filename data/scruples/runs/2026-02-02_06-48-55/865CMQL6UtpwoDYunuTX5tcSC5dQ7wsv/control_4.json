There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe flatmate (the author) is dealing with a roommate who consistently has loud sex, which is disturbing the rest of the household. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, needing to get up early, decides to confront this by walking into her room uninvited during another incident. This leads to a confrontation where the author orders the guy to leave and tells the girl to move out.\n\nHmm, the key points here are privacy violations and the right to address disturbances. The author's actions\u2014walking into someone's room without permission\u2014could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the roommate was being disruptive, entering her private space without consent is problematic. The author might have had legitimate frustration, but the method they chose to handle it seems extreme. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the door was unlocked. Even if the door was open, walking in without permission isn't appropriate. The guy was there, but the author's threat to call security and the use of aggressive language might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with the author and thanked them, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The legal and ethical standards usually prioritize respecting others' privacy. Even if the roommate was at fault, the author's response could be considered an overreaction and an invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, while the roommate's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's actions crossed a line by invading her private moment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
