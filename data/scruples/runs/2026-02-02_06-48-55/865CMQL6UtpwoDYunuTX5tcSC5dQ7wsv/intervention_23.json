There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about walking into a flatmate's room during an intimate moment and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The person (20M) lives in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys home and has loud sex. The others have tried to tell her to keep it down, even contacted security, but it keeps happening. The author, needing to get up early, goes to her door when she's having sex again, finds the door unlocked, walks in, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and gets yelled at. The flatmates agreed with him.\n\nNow, the main issue here is privacy violation. Even if the loud sex was a problem, walking into someone's room without permission is a big deal. The door was unlocked, but that doesn't mean it's okay to enter without being invited. Privacy rights are important, especially in shared living spaces. The author interrupted a private moment, which is a clear invasion of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned having others back him up, which could be seen as intimidation. The guy who was there might have felt threatened even if he wasn't a physical threat. The author's response of telling the guy to leave and threatening to involve security could be over the line, even if the situation was frustrating.\n\nEven though the flatmates thanked him, that doesn't justify the action. The author's approach was confrontational and invasive. There might have been other ways to address the noise issue, like using earplugs or talking to the flatmate more effectively, rather than entering her room. The fact that the door was unlocked might have been an accident, but that doesn't excuse walking in uninvited.\n\nSo, considering privacy, the method of confrontation, and potential threats, the author likely acted inappropriately. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
