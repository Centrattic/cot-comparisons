There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy issues. Even if there's been a pattern of behavior (like loud sex), entering someone's room without permission is a clear privacy violation. The person had a right to privacy in their own space. So, the act of entering without consent is problematic.\n\nNext, the situation leading up to it: the flatmates were annoyed and had tried to address the noise. They even involved security, but it didn't help. The author felt they had enough and took matters into their own hands. But does that justify breaking into the flatmate's room? Probably not. There are other ways to address the issue, like talking again, setting boundaries, or maybe even moving out if it's that bad.\n\nWhat about the timing? It was 2am, and the author had an early start. The stress of exams and deadlines might contribute to the frustration, but that doesn't excuse the action. The immediate response was to confront them physically, which could escalate things.\n\nThe aftermath: the guy left after being threatened with calling security. The flatmate was upset and called the author names. The other flatmates supported the author, but their support doesn't make the action right. The author's approach was confrontational and invasive.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: In many places, entering someone's room without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, it doesn't give the right to walk in without being invited. The author's actions could be seen as harassment or assault, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nPossible consequences: The flatmate might report the incident, leading to conflicts or even legal issues. The author's response was aggressive and disrespectful. Even if the flatmate was being a problem, the way the author handled it was inappropriate.\n\nConclusion: The author's actions were wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy and used intimidation. There are better, more respectful ways to handle shared living conflicts. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
