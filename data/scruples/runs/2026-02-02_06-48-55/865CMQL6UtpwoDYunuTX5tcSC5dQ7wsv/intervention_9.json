There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a flat with six people, one of whom is a girl who frequently brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. The author, frustrated after multiple complaints and ignored warnings, decides to confront the situation by entering the flatmate's room when she's having sex again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's private room without their consent, especially during an intimate moment, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, the act of entering without permission might be illegal. The author saw the flatmate and her partner having sex, which could be considered voyeurism. Additionally, threatening to call security and using others as witnesses might be seen as intimidation.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. While the flatmates were disturbed and had valid complaints, the method of resolution chosen was confrontational and invasive. The author's actions led to emotional distress for the flatmate, which isn't justified regardless of the noise issue. The response was excessive and could have escalated the conflict instead of resolving it through proper channels like speaking with a landlord or university housing office.\n\nThe flatmates' agreement with the author's actions doesn't change the fact that the behavior was inappropriate. Just because others supported it doesn't make it right. It's important to address issues through respectful and legal means rather than taking matters into one's own hands. The author could have faced consequences like being reported for invasion of privacy or harassment.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the noise problem, the author's method of entering the room and confronting the situation was wrong. The correct approach would have been to follow proper procedures for resolving disputes, not to invade someone's privacy.\n"
