There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and refusing to leave. The situation involves a group of university students sharing a flat. The main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In most places, entering someone's private space without permission, especially during a sensitive activity like sex, is a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give someone the right to enter. However, the author mentions that the door was unlocked because the couple had forgotten to lock it when they entered drunk. But that doesn't excuse walking in without permission.\n\nThe flatmates had been disturbed by loud sex multiple times, which is a valid annoyance. They tried to communicate through the flat chat, but that didn't work. The author took it upon themselves to confront the situation directly, which might have been impulsive. While the noise was a problem, the method of resolution involved entering a private space, which is a serious breach of privacy and trust between roommates.\n\nEven if the author's intention was to stop the noise, the way they handled it was extreme. Threatening the guy to leave, using aggressive language, and not respecting the couple's privacy could be seen as overstepping. The flatmates might support the author for stopping the noise, but that doesn't make the action right. There might be potential for escalation, legal issues, or loss of privacy rights if the situation were to be taken to a higher authority like the university or housing authorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was frustrated and had valid reasons for wanting peace, especially with exams and early starts. The couple's behavior was disruptive and they didn't heed warnings. However, the appropriate action would have been to continue using established communication methods or perhaps involve a more formal complaint process through the housing office, not to intrude on their privacy.\n\nSo, weighing the breach of privacy against the disruption caused by the loud sex, the author's actions, while understandable in intent, were not the right way to handle the situation. They should have found a more respectful and legal method to address the noise issue without invading someone else's privacy.\n"
