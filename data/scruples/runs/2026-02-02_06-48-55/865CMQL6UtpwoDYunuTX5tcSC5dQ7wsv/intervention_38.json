There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario describes someone entering without permission after knocking and not getting a response. The key points here are consent and privacy.\n\nFirst, the author knocked on the door, and when there was no response, they entered. Even though the door was unlocked, walking in without permission is a breach of privacy. The flatmate was in a private moment, and entering without consent, regardless of the reason, is problematic. \n\nThe reason given is that the flatmates are disturbed by the loud sex and have previously tried to address it without success. While the noise is an issue, the solution of entering someone's room without their consent could lead to serious repercussions. The author's actions were confrontational and potentially illegal, even if they felt justified. \n\nThe fact that the flatmates agreed with the action doesn't negate the fact that it was unauthorized. Privacy rights are important, and entering someone's space during such a personal act is a violation. Even if the intention was to stop noise, the method used was extreme and likely to cause harm or legal issues. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for invading their flatmate's privacy without consent, regardless of the motivation.\n"
