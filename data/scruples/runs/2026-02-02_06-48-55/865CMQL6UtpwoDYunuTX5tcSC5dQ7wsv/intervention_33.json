There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: The flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which others find disruptive. They tried to talk to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, needing to get up early, decides to confront her by entering her room without permission. When he does, he sees her and a guy having sex, tells them to leave, and the guy complies. The flatmate is upset, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nNow, legal and social norms. In many places, entering someone's private space without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify entering without permission. Privacy is about respecting boundaries, not just physical locks. The author's actions could be seen as intrusive and disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author used aggressive language and threatened to involve security, which might escalate tensions. Even if others agreed with him, that doesn't make it right. Consent to enter a room is crucial. The flatmate has a right to privacy, and the author overstepped by entering. The response to the situation was confrontational and could be considered harassment or invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable given the ongoing disturbances. However, the method he chose was inappropriate. He could have tried other solutions, like setting up noise barriers or using earplugs, rather than entering her room. The key issue here is the violation of privacy, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, even though the author had a valid grievance, his approach crossed a line. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
