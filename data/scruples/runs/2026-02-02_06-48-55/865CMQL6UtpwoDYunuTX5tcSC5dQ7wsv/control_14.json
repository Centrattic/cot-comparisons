There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The person (20M) is in a shared flat with 5 others. The female flatmate is having loud sex, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried to tell her, even contacted security, but it didn't work. Then, when she does it again, he goes to her room, finds her having sex, and confronts them. He even tells the guy to leave. The girl is upset, calls him names, and the others agree with him.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the legal and social aspects.\n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without their permission could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is a violation. The situation is more complicated because it's a shared living space, but each person's room is typically considered private. So, entering without being invited could be an issue.\n\nSocially, while the flatmates are frustrated, the way he handled it might not be appropriate. Confronting someone in the middle of an intimate act is a big intrusion. Even if the others are annoyed, using such direct action might escalate tensions. The guy was trying to address a noise issue, but the method involved intruding on privacy.\n\nAlso, the guy's response\u2014telling the man to leave and threatening to call security\u2014might be seen as aggressive. While the flatmates might support him, the act of entering the room without consent is a key point here. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being asked is a privacy violation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The main issue is the violation of privacy. Even if the situation was frustrating, entering someone's room without their consent is wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
