There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a shared flat with five others. The flatmate (a girl) frequently brings guys home and has loud sex, which disturbs everyone. They tried talking to her, even contacted security, but it didn't help. Then, when it happens again at 2 AM, the author goes into her room, finds her in the act, confronts her, gets the guy to leave, and tells her to move out. The others agree with him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, interrupting a private act, and using threats. \n\nLegally, entering someone's room without consent is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in during such a private moment is an invasion. The author's actions could be considered trespassing or even assault if the guy felt threatened. The flatmates' agreement doesn't change the legal aspect. \n\nEthically, it's complicated. The noise issue is valid, and the flatmates tried to address it. However, the method of resolving it was extreme. The author didn't seek a peaceful solution but instead took matters into his own hands, which can lead to conflict. \n\nThe guy being threatened to leave with the threat of calling security and having others back him up might be seen as bullying. The flatmate was humiliated, and the author's response was aggressive. Even if the others are grateful for the immediate result, the approach was confrontational and disrespectful.\n\nSo, while the noise problem is real, the author's actions crossed boundaries. The right approach would have been to document the issue, maybe involve university housing or legal means rather than acting impulsively. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
