There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario involves multiple flatmates annoyed by loud sex, which they've tried to address without success. The author decided to confront the situation by entering the room, which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission can be a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, it's not an invitation to enter. The act of walking in during such an intimate moment is a clear breach of personal space and privacy laws.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. The flatmates had tried to communicate their discomfort, but the author took matters into their own hands. While their frustration is understandable, entering someone's room without consent, especially during a private activity, is generally considered inappropriate. The author's threat to call security and use other flatmates as backup adds to the potential legal issues, as it could be seen as intimidation or harassment.\n\nThe flatmates supporting the author might justify the action, but that doesn't make it right. Privacy is a fundamental right, and the author's actions could lead to further conflict or legal repercussions. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't negate the violation of privacy. The author's approach was confrontational and aggressive, which escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions were a violation of privacy and appropriate boundaries, even if motivated by frustration. Therefore, the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
