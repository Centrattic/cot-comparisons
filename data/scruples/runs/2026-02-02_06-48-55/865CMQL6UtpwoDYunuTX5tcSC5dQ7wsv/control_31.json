There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The flatmate is having loud sex often, which is disrupting the others. They tried telling her, even contacting security, but nothing worked. Then, the author decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes into her room, sees them having sex, and demands the guy leave. The guy leaves after being threatened with security. The flatmate is upset, and the others agree with the author.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let me think about the legal and social aspects. Entering someone's room without their consent is generally a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give you the right to enter, especially if you weren't invited. The author walked in while they were having sex, which is a very private moment. Legally, this might be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy, depending on local laws.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of how he handled it. Threatening the guy with calling security and using others to back him up could be seen as harassment. Even if the flatmates were annoyed, the author's approach was confrontational and aggressive. The guy was just there, and the author's reaction might have been disproportionate.\n\nHowever, the story does mention that the flatmate had been causing disruptions repeatedly. The others were frustrated and wanted peace. The author might have felt that this was a necessary action to stop the ongoing disturbance. But does that justify breaking into her room and confronting them? Probably not. There are other ways to handle it, like involving the university authorities again, or maybe changing the locks, but not entering someone's private space without permission.\n\nAlso, the author's language was aggressive and threatening. Using phrases like \"I'll fucking call security\" and \"our words against yours\" could be seen as coercive. Even if the author was angry, the way he acted might be seen as bullying or intimidation. The flatmate's rights to privacy and the other person's right to be in her home should be considered.\n\nIn conclusion, while the frustration is understandable, the author's actions violated the flatmate's privacy and used inappropriate methods to address the issue. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
