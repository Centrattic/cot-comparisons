There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of roommates dealing with a girl who repeatedly has loud sex, leading to the author taking drastic action.\n\nFirst, the author's main complaint is about noise and lack of sleep, which is a valid concern. They've tried talking to the flatmate and even involved security, but it didn't work. However, the way they addressed the issue might be problematic. Walking into someone's room without permission, especially during a private act like sex, is a serious invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is a breach of trust and personal space. \n\nThe author confronted the situation in a confrontational manner, using harsh language and threatening to call security. While the roommates agreed with the action, it's important to consider the legality and social norms. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission could lead to legal issues, especially if it's considered harassment or invasion of privacy. The author's actions might escalate tensions and create a hostile living environment. \n\nAdditionally, the response to the guy leaving was aggressive. Telling him to leave and threatening to involve others could be seen as intimidation. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying) and the author's dismissive attitude suggest that the approach was not constructive. \n\nWhile the author had valid frustrations, the method of resolving them was inappropriate. There are better ways to address the issue, such as setting clear boundaries in advance, using mediation, or potentially moving out if the situation is unbearable. The key takeaway is that privacy rights are important, and reacting with confrontation without considering legal and social consequences can lead to being in the wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
