There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate has a history of having loud sex that disturbs others, and the author decided to confront her by entering the room. The key points here are privacy, consent, and appropriate conflict resolution.\n\nEven if the flatmate's actions were disruptive, entering someone's room without permission is a breach of privacy. People have a right to privacy in their own rooms, even if they're in a shared living space. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of that privacy, regardless of the motive. \n\nThen there's the act of confronting them while they were in the middle of a private act. That's not just a privacy issue but could also be considered a violation of their personal space. The author's response\u2014yelling, threatening to call security, and telling the flatmate to move out\u2014might escalate tensions and could be seen as aggressive, especially in an emotional situation. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with the author, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. Group dynamics can sometimes lead people to support a confrontational approach, but it doesn't excuse the violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author used threatening language, which could be seen as aggressive. The guy who was there might have felt threatened, and the flatmate's reaction (crying and yelling) suggests she felt violated. Even if the author was frustrated, the method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. \n\nThere's also the legal aspect to consider. Depending on the country, entering someone's room without permission could be considered trespassing or even sexual assault if the entry was unwelcome. The author might be legally liable here. \n\nIn terms of conflict resolution, there are better ways to address ongoing disturbances, like setting clear boundaries, using noise complaints through proper channels, or maybe even moving out if the situation is unbearable. Confronting someone in such a direct and intrusive way is not a healthy or respectful solution. \n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author had valid reasons for being upset, the method used was wrong. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
