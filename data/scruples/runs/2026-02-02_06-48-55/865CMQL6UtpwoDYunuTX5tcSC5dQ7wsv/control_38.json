There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author lives in a shared flat with five others, including this female flatmate who frequently has loud sex, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author had to get up early and couldn't sleep. So, they entered her room, saw her having sex, told the guy to leave, and confronted her.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether walking into someone's room without permission is justified, even if they were disturbing others. Privacy is a big factor. Even if the neighbors were being loud, entering someone's room uninvited is a breach of privacy. The guy in the room might have a right to privacy as well. The author could have called security or another authority instead of entering. Also, threatening the guy and making him leave might be seen as aggressive. The flatmates supporting the author doesn't necessarily mean it was the right action. Legally, entering someone's room without permission could be considered trespassing, especially if the door was unlocked. The author's actions might have escalated the situation, leading to potential legal issues. Even if the flatmates are okay with it, it's not legally or ethically sound. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the invasion of privacy and the forceful actions taken.\n"
