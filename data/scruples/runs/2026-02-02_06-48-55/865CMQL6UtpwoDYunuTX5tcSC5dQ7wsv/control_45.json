There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is that the flatmate is having loud sex repeatedly, disturbing others, and the author decided to confront her by entering the room when she didn't respond to knocks. They then told the guy to leave and the flatmate was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. Entering someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, is a privacy violation. The author walked in during a private act, which is a clear issue. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give permission for someone else to enter. The act of walking in and confronting them, especially during such an intimate moment, is problematic.\n\nNext, the author's motivation was to stop the noise. But the method used was confrontational and intruded on privacy. The right to privacy is important, so even if the others were disturbed, using that as a reason to enter the room without consent is not appropriate. The author could have taken other steps, like speaking to the flatmate directly when possible, setting boundaries, or using other means to address the noise issue without invading privacy.\n\nThe author claims that the flatmate didn't listen to previous requests. However, the response was to enter her room during an intimate act, which is a drastic step. The confrontation involved aggressive language and threatening to call security, which can be seen as intimidation. The guy was asked to leave, which might have been a way to pressure the flatmate but could also be seen as targeting the third party involved.\n\nThe flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Even if others are upset by the noise, the method of resolving it by entering someone's room is not a socially acceptable solution. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences if the flatmate feels her privacy was violated. In many places, entering someone's private space without consent, especially during a private act, is a violation of privacy laws.\n\nAdditionally, the emotional impact on the flatmate, who was crying and upset, shows that the author's actions caused significant distress. Even if the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the response was out of proportion and invasive. The author's approach lacks respect for her privacy and autonomy, regardless of the noise issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions crossed a boundary by invading someone's privacy to address a noise problem. The correct approach would have been to address the issue through communication, possibly with the help of roommates or authorities in a respectful manner, rather than confronting them in an intimate situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
