There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a 20-year-old male, lives in a flat with five others. There's a female flatmate who brings guys back and has loud sex, which the others find annoying. They've told her to keep it down, even contacted security, but it's not helping. The author has exams and essays coming up, and when this happens again at 2 AM, he goes to her room. The door was unlocked, and he walks in while she's having sex. The guy she's with is there, and the author confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and tells the girl to move out. The girl gets upset, and the author's flatmates support him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're engaged in a private activity, is a big deal. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in uninvited is a violation of privacy. The author had the intention to confront them, which might not be justified. The loud sex is a disturbance, but the solution of entering their room and interrupting is problematic. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the door wasn't locked, the act of entering without consent is an issue. The author then demands the guy to leave, which might be considered trespassing or harassment. The threat to call security and use others as backup could be intimidation. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with him, but that doesn't make it right. The author's method of addressing the problem was aggressive and potentially illegal. Even if the noise was a problem, there are other ways to handle it, like using white noise machines, discussing it calmly, or moving to another living arrangement. \n\nThe girl's response of calling the author a cunt and asshole is her own wrongdoing, but it doesn't excuse his actions. The author's approach was confrontational and disrespectful. The fact that the guy was nervous and left quickly might indicate that the author's threats were effective, but that doesn't make the action right. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, entering someone's private space without invitation could lead to charges like trespassing or assault. Even if the door was unlocked, the intent to intrude on a private moment is an issue. The author's words, like calling the girl a piece of shit and telling her to leave, are hostile and could be considered harassment. \n\nThe author's flatmates thanking him might be due to their shared frustration, but their support doesn't validate the action. It's possible they also feel it's wrong but are relieved the noise stopped. The key here is that resolving a conflict through confrontation and invasion of privacy is not appropriate. \n\nSo considering all that, even though the author had legitimate complaints about the noise, his method of addressing it was inappropriate and likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
