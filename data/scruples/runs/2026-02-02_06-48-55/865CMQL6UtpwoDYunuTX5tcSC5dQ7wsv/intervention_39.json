There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 20-year-old male living with five others, including a female flatmate who's been having loud sex with guys, disturbing everyone. They tried talking to her, then security, but it didn't help. One night, when she's doing it again, the author goes into her unlocked room, sees them having sex, and confronts them. He gets the guy to leave and tells the girl to move out. The flatmates agree with him, but he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and consent. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without their permission during a private moment is a breach of their privacy. The fact that the door was unlocked might not excuse it. People have a right to privacy in their own rooms, especially when engaging in intimate activities. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as a violation of the flatmate's rights. Even if the others were annoyed, the appropriate response might have been to talk to her again, involve a mediator, or take legal steps if necessary. Physically entering her room and confronting them in that way could be considered harassment or assault, depending on local laws. Threatening to call security and using others' support as leverage might be seen as intimidation.\n\nThe flatmates agreeing with him doesn't make it right. The law typically protects people's privacy and their right to be free from intrusion. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable due to the ongoing disturbances, are not justified by the circumstances. There are legal and ethical boundaries here that were crossed, regardless of the motivation.\n\nSo, even though the author was trying to solve a problem that annoyed everyone, his method was inappropriate and potentially illegal. The correct approach would involve more respectful and lawful methods of resolving the issue, not entering someone's private space during an intimate moment.\n"
