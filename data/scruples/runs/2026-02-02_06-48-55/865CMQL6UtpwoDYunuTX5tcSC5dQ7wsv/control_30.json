There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (20M) did something wrong by walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a shared flat with multiple people. The flatmate in question, a 20F, has a history of bringing guys over and having loud sex, which is disturbing her housemates. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, frustrated, decided to confront her by entering her unlocked room during a sexual encounter, confronts both her and the guy, demands they leave, and eventually causes the guy to leave. The flatmate reacts angrily, and the author's roommates support him.\n\nNow, the key points here: entering someone's private room without permission, even if it's unlocked, could be seen as a violation of privacy. The author interrupted a private, intimate act, which is a significant invasion. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without permission is problematic. The confrontation was hostile, using derogatory language, and threatening the guy with security. While the flatmates were annoyed, the method used here crosses a line. The author had the right to be upset about the noise and disruption, but the solution involved trespassing and confrontation, which might be considered an overreaction. Privacy rights are important, and even in a shared living space, there's an expectation of privacy in one's own room. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't necessarily justify entering without being invited, especially during a private moment. The author's actions could lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or assault if the guy felt threatened. Even if the flatmates support him, the act itself is ethically questionable. So, while the annoyance is understandable, the method of dealing with it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
