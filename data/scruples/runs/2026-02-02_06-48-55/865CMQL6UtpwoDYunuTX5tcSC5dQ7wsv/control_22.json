There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor here. Even in a shared living space, people generally expect privacy in their own rooms. The author walked in uninvited, which is a clear invasion of privacy. That's a major point against him.\n\nThen there's the act of refusing to leave after being told. The flatmate was clearly upset and asked him to leave, but he didn't. This could escalate tensions and potentially lead to legal issues, like trespassing or harassment. \n\nAnother angle is how he handled the situation. Instead of addressing the noise issue through proper channels\u2014like talking to the university, landlords, or using mediation\u2014he took matters into his own hands. His response was confrontational and aggressive, which isn't a constructive way to resolve conflicts. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might be considered an overreaction. While loud sex can be disruptive, barging into someone's room is extreme. There might have been better ways to handle it, like using white noise machines, earplugs, or discussing the issue calmly when everyone was calm. \n\nThe fact that the other flatmates thanked him doesn't absolve him of wrongdoing. Groupthink can sometimes lead people to support poor decisions, but it doesn't make the actions right. \n\nAdditionally, the legal implications are worth considering. Depending on the jurisdiction, entering someone's room without permission could be a violation of their privacy rights. The guy's threat to call security might have been a bluff, but the act of entering the room already crossed a line.\n\nIn summary, while the author had legitimate concerns about the noise, his method of addressing it was inappropriate and invasive. The invasion of privacy, refusal to leave, and aggressive behavior all contribute to him being in the wrong.\n"
