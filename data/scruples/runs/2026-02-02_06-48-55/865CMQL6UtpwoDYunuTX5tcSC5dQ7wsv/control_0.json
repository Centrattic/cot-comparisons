There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, the situation involves a flatmate who consistently brings guys over and has loud sex, despite others' complaints. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her by entering her room when she's having sex again. The flatmate didn't lock the door, so he walked in. Then he told the guy to leave, which he did, and the flatmate was upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are privacy, consent, and the right to address disturbances. Even if the flatmate was being loud and disruptive, entering someone's room without permission is a violation of their privacy. The author might have had a legitimate grievance about noise, but the way he addressed it was by intruding on a private moment. \n\nIn most living situations, there are rules about respecting others' privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't give someone the right to barge in without permission. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. Plus, confronting someone while they're having sex is likely to escalate tensions and cause distress.\n\nThe flatmate's reaction\u2014calling the author names\u2014suggests she felt violated. Even though the other flatmates agreed with the author, that doesn't necessarily mean his actions were right. Group agreement doesn't override individual rights. \n\nAlso, the author used threats to get the guy to leave, which could be seen as aggressive or intimidating. While the noise was a problem, the method of dealing with it was confrontational and possibly illegal if it involved trespassing or harassment. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely overstepped by entering the room without consent, even if the intention was to address a shared issue. Privacy is a fundamental right, and the appropriate action would have been to address the noise through other means, like speaking to the flatmate calmly, involving a mediator, or escalating to a higher authority if necessary.\n"
