There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room during a sexual act and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the scenario. The author went into the flatmate's room without being invited. Even though the door was unlocked, entering without permission is a privacy violation. The flatmate had already been disturbing others with loud sex, and the group had tried to address it without success. However, the author's response was to confront them in a very public and aggressive manner.\n\nLegally, entering someone's room without consent is an invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't necessarily justify walking in. The author's actions could be considered trespassing or even assault depending on local laws, especially since they forced the guy to leave and used threatening language.\n\nEthically, even if the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the author's approach was extreme. Instead of finding a non-confrontational solution\u2014like speaking to her privately or involving higher authorities\u2014entering her room during an intimate moment is a violation of trust and personal space. The other flatmates thanked him, but that doesn't negate the fact that his actions could have legal and social repercussions.\n\nThe flatmate's reaction (crying and calling the author names) suggests that the confrontation was traumatic for her. The author's public shaming and aggressive behavior might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Even if the group had collective complaints, individual actions don't always solve shared issues and can lead to more conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the flatmate's loud sex was an issue, the author's method of addressing it by invading her privacy and using threats was inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to handle the situation without violating personal boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
