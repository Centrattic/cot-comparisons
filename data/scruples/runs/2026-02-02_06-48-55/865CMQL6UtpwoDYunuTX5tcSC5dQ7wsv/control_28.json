There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a flatmate having loud sex, and the author walking into her room and refusing to let the guy leave. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and five others live with a girl who frequently brings guys back and has loud sex, which disrupts their sleep. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but nothing worked. Then, in this instance, the author goes to her door at 2am, bangs on it, and when it's unlocked, enters and sees them having sex. The guy leaves after being threatened to call security, and the girl is upset, leading to the question if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the main ethical and legal issues here are privacy, consent, and appropriate response to a disturbance. Entering someone's room without their permission, especially when they're in a private act like having sex, is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily make it okay to barge in without consent. The author's actions could be considered trespassing or even harassment, depending on the context.\n\nThe author's motivation was to get some sleep and address the ongoing issue. While the problem with the flatmate is valid, the method used here is problematic. Instead of confronting the situation in a private manner, like talking to her in the morning, the author chose to interrupt them in the moment. This could escalate tensions and lead to a hostile environment. \n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned other flatmates supporting their actions. However, this might be trying to assert dominance or use social pressure, which isn't a good approach. The flatmates thanking the author could be due to frustration, but that doesn't make the action right. \n\nLegally, entering someone's room without permission is a breach of privacy. Ethically, even if the flatmate is inconsiderate, the author's response was aggressive and disrespectful. There's a better way to handle such situations, like setting boundaries through communication or involving proper authorities if necessary. \n\nMoreover, the girl's emotional reaction (crying, yelling) suggests that the author's behavior was harmful. While the author might have felt justified, the act of telling the guy to leave and the harsh language used could cross into bullying or abuse territory. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were an invasion of privacy and handled in a confrontational manner. Even though the flatmate had a history of being loud, the response was not appropriate. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
