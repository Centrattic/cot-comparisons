There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with four others. The flatmate is a girl who brings guys over and has loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, needing to sleep for an early start, went to her room when she was having sex again. The door was unlocked, he walked in, saw them, and then told them to leave. The guy left, but the girl was upset and called him names. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is entering someone's private space without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, walking into someone's room while they're intimate is a violation of privacy. The author had no right to do that regardless of the noise issue. Intervening in such a personal situation, especially with threats, could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful. Even if the others agree with him, the act of entering without consent is definitely a problem. Privacy rights are important, and there are more appropriate ways to handle noise complaints, like using earplugs or discussing it calmly. The author's actions, while maybe understandable in frustration, cross into inappropriate territory. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
