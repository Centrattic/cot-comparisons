There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is described in the AITA post.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author is 20M, living in a shared flat with 5 others. The female flatmate (20F) is bringing guys home, having loud sex that disturbs everyone. They've tried telling her, even contacting security, but she doesn't listen. Then, the author goes into her room uninvited, sees them having sex, and confronts both the girl and the guy. The guy leaves, and the girl is upset. The author's flatmates agree with him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy, consent, and appropriate response. Even if the flatmate was being annoying, walking into someone's room uninvited is a violation of privacy. The author didn't knock and waited for her to open, then forced entry. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is a problem. Then confronting them in that intimate moment, yelling, threatening to call security, and telling the guy to get out. That's aggressive and could be seen as harassment or assault. The flatmates' agreement doesn't make it right. The author's actions could lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or assault. Even if the others were annoyed, the solution is to communicate better, maybe involve the landlord, or follow proper procedures instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
