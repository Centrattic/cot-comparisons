There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The main question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nFirst, there's the issue of privacy. Everyone has a right to privacy in their own room, especially during intimate moments. Even if the flatmate was being loud and disturbing others, barging into her room without permission is a serious invasion of privacy. So that's a key point. The author didn't knock and wait, he just walked in. That's a problem.\n\nThen, the context: the flatmates were annoyed because she kept having loud sex. They tried talking to her, even told security, but it didn't help. The author took it upon himself to confront her. But even in that case, the method he used was extreme. Instead of maybe talking to her again or finding another solution, he decided to storm into her room. That seems like a poor choice.\n\nAlso, when he entered, he didn't just ask them to stop or leave; he started yelling at her, called her names, told her to leave, and even threatened the guy. That's aggressive behavior. Even if the flatmates were upset, responding with aggression and confrontation without any communication is likely to escalate the situation.\n\nThe flatmate was having sex, so she and the guy were in a vulnerable state. The author's actions could be seen as violating their privacy and possibly causing emotional distress. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't justify entering without permission. People might forget to lock doors for various reasons, but that doesn't mean it's okay to barge in.\n\nThe flatmates agreed with him, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Group consensus doesn't override individual rights. Also, threatening the guy with calling security and saying they have four others as backup\u2014using threats of collective action against someone alone is not a fair approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author violated the flatmate's privacy, acted aggressively without communication, and escalated the situation. Even though the flatmates were annoyed, the method he used was inappropriate. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
