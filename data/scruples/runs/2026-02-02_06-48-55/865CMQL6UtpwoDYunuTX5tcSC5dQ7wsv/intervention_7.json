There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is that the girl is having loud sex frequently, disturbing others, and the author, after multiple complaints, decides to confront her by entering her room when she's in the middle of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, entering someone's private room without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter without consent. Privacy rights are important, and walking in during a sexual act is a significant intrusion.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical side. The flatmates have been annoyed, but the author's response was to confront the situation aggressively. The girl was having sex, and the author's actions caused her emotional distress. Even if others agree with the author, that doesn't make it right. It's about respecting others' boundaries and finding a respectful solution instead of taking matters into one's own hands.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to call security and mention having others back him up could be seen as intimidation. While the girl's behavior was disruptive, the method of dealing with it was confrontational and possibly abusive. The author might be justified in wanting to address the noise, but the approach was inappropriate.\n\nIn many places, entering someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, can be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. Additionally, confronting someone in the middle of a sexual act is socially unacceptable and could lead to legal consequences if the person feels violated.\n\nThe flatmates' agreement doesn't absolve the author of wrongdoing. Just because others are upset doesn't mean the solution is to act aggressively. Proper steps would involve formal complaints, maybe involving housing authorities, or seeking mediation rather than direct confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a violation of privacy and a breach of social etiquette. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
