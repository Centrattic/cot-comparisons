There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario is that the flatmate is having loud sex, others have complained, and the author decided to confront her by entering the room. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, entering someone's room without permission, even if it's a shared flat, can be considered a breach of privacy. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't necessarily excuse the intrusion. The author walked in without consent, which could be a privacy violation.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if the flatmates were annoyed by the noise, confronting someone in the middle of intimate activity is a big step. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially using threats and aggressive language. The guy being asked to leave in a threatening manner could be problematic too. Coercion and intimidation aren't healthy ways to resolve conflicts.\n\nThe flatmates' agreement with the author's actions might influence the perception, but that doesn't make it right. Group consensus doesn't justify violating someone's privacy. Also, the author's response\u2014calling the girl names and telling her to move out\u2014adds to the conflict rather than resolving it respectfully.\n\nLegal consequences could include charges related to invasion of privacy or assault if the situation escalates. Even without legal issues, the social and emotional impact on the flatmate is significant. The girl was upset and called the author names, which might be a reaction to feeling disrespected.\n\nAlternative solutions might have been better, like using noise complaints, setting clearer boundaries, or involving the university housing department. The author's approach was confrontational and potentially harmful, even if the intention was to stop the noise. \n\nIn conclusion, while the flatmates were disturbed, the method used was inappropriate. The author violated privacy, used threats, and escalated the situation. So the answer is A.\n"
