There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a shared flat with five others. The girl in question brings guys over and has loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but she continues. The author, needing to be up early, goes to confront her by entering her room when she's with someone again. He finds them having sex, tells the guy to leave, and the girl gets upset. The other flatmates agree with him.\n\nNow, considering the legal and social aspects. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission, especially when they're engaged in intimate acts, can be an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give him the right to enter. The act of entering could be seen as trespassing or a violation of privacy. The guy's actions led to the situation where the couple was disturbed, which could be distressing for them. The girl called him a \"cunt,\" which might be an emotional reaction but doesn't necessarily justify the intrusion.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, while the other flatmates agree with him, that doesn't make it right. They should address the noise issue through proper channels, like formal complaints or moving to a more suitable living arrangement. The author's method of confronting the issue directly by entering her room is problematic. He used threats (\"call security,\" \"our words against yours\") which could be seen as intimidation. The guy leaving because he was afraid of the confrontation shows that the method was aggressive.\n\nHowever, the context of repeated disturbances and the failure of other methods might make the author feel justified. But legally and ethically, entering someone's private space without consent is a clear violation. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by frustration, crossed a line. He should have addressed the issue without invading her privacy, perhaps by documenting the disturbances and formally reporting them if necessary, rather than taking matters into his own hands.\n\nSo, even though the flatmates support him, the act itself is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
