There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 20-year-old male living in a shared flat with five others. The female flatmate brings guys home often and has loud sex, which upsets everyone. They've tried telling her and even contacted security, but nothing worked. The author was awake due to exams and had an early start, so he decided to confront her by entering her unlocked room where she was having sex again. He saw them, told the guy to leave, and the flatmates supported him.\n\nNow, the main issue here is invasion of privacy. Even if the room was unlocked, walking in on someone having sex without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The author had the right to be upset about the noise, but the way he handled it was by intruding on their private moment. The guy was there consensually, and the author's aggressive behavior led to the guy leaving. The female flatmate was upset and called him names, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe flatmates agreed with the author, but that doesn't necessarily make his actions right. The author's approach was confrontational and could be seen as an overstep. Instead of handling the situation calmly, he escalated it by entering her room and confronting them. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't justify walking in without permission. The author's actions could be considered an invasion of privacy, which is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, even though the situation was frustrating, the method used was inappropriate. The author should have found another way to address the noise problem, maybe through a more formal complaint or finding a mutual solution with the flatmate. His actions led to a confrontation that could have been avoided, and he put himself in a position where he might be held responsible for disrupting someone's privacy.\n"
