There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: the author (20M) lives in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys home and has loud sex. The others have complained, even to security, but it's not resolved. The author, needing to get up early, enters her room when she's having sex again, sees them, and confronts them. The guy leaves after being threatened with security, and the girl is upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. Entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're in a private moment, is a big deal. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to barge in. Privacy is a fundamental right. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of that privacy. The flatmate's behavior was inappropriate (loud sex without considering others), but the author's response was confrontational and aggressive. \n\nThe author claims the flatmates supported him and thanked him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was right. In many places, even if someone is doing something annoying, entering their room without consent is a privacy violation. The confrontation escalated the situation, leading to emotional distress for the flatmate. \n\nAlso, the author's threat to call security and mention \"our words against yours\" could be seen as intimidation. The guy leaving quickly might indicate fear, which could imply that the author's approach was too harsh. \n\nWhile the flatmate's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response crossed a line by invading privacy and using threats. There are other ways to address the issue, like setting communal rules or involving the landlord. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he violated the flatmate's privacy and acted in a confrontational manner. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
