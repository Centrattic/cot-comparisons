There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a shared flat with five other people. The main issue is the noise from the flatmate's sexual activities, which the others have repeatedly asked her to keep down, even reporting to security with no result. The author then decides to confront her by entering the room when they hear loud sex again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission, even if it's a shared space, could be considered a violation of their privacy. Consent is key here. The flatmate didn't invite the author into her room, and entering without permission is a problem, regardless of the reason. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean the author had the right to enter.\n\nNext, the social implications. While the flatmates have been annoyed by the noise, the author's approach was confrontational and invasive. Instead of finding a respectful solution\u2014like talking to her calmly or using other means to address the noise\u2014walking in unannounced and disrupting the act is a drastic and inappropriate response. The other flatmates might be annoyed, but the author's method of dealing with it is not socially acceptable. The threat to call security and the aggressive language (\"piece of shit,\" \"fuck\") escalate the situation and could be seen as harassment or assault, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions that the other flatmates thanked him, but their approval doesn't make the action right. It's possible they were just relieved that the noise stopped, not that the method was appropriate. The flatmate's reaction (crying and calling the author names) shows the emotional impact of the intrusion.\n\nAlso, the author's use of force or threat to get the guy to leave could have legal consequences. If the man felt threatened, the author could be in trouble for intimidation. Even if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the method of confrontation is not justified.\n\nIn summary, while the noise issue is a valid concern, the author's approach was a violation of privacy, potentially illegal, and socially inappropriate. The correct course of action would have been to address the noise through established channels or mutual agreement, not by intruding on someone's private moment.\n"
