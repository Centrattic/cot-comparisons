There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, with five other flatmates. The flatmate in question is known for bringing guys over and having loud sex, which others find disturbing. This has happened before, and they've tried telling her and even involving security, but nothing worked. \n\nThe key event here is the author walking in while she's having sex. The door was unlocked, the couple was drunk. The author was annoyed, had an early start, and decided to confront them. They walked in, told them to stop, then ordered the guy to leave. The flatmate reacted angrily, and the author left, telling the others who supported the action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. Even if the flatmate was noisy, others have a right to privacy in their own rooms. The author entered without permission, which is a violation of privacy. The fact that the door was unlocked might not excuse the intrusion. Also, using force or intimidation, like threatening to call security and mention other flatmates, could be seen as aggressive.\n\nNext, the author's actions could be considered trespassing. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without their consent is a legal issue. The couple was in the middle of a private act, and the author's presence violated their privacy. The author's justification is that the noise was disturbing, but that doesn't necessarily justify breaking into the room.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to involve security and other flatmates might be a form of coercion. The guy left because he was scared of the numbers and the threat, which could be seen as bullying. The flatmates supporting the action doesn't make it right; it's about the legality and social norms.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the flatmate might have been disruptive, but the author's response was extreme. There are other ways to handle noise issues, like using earplugs, setting up a system to check if the door is locked, or maybe even changing the locks. Confronting them in such a public and aggressive manner could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe emotional impact on the flatmate is also a factor. She was upset and called the author names, but that's a reaction to the intrusion, not an excuse for the author's actions. The author might have overreacted, using harsh language and threats.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author invaded privacy, used intimidation, and threatened the other person. Even though the noise was an issue, the method of confronting it was inappropriate. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
