There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys back and has loud sex. The others have been annoyed by this and told her to keep it down, but she didn't listen. They even reported to security, which didn't help. Then, when she does it again, the author goes into her room while they're having sex, tells the guy to leave, and confronts her. The guy leaves, the girl is upset, and the author is questioned if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: walking into someone's room without permission. In most places, entering someone's private space without consent is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give permission to enter. The couple had a right to privacy in their own room. The author's action of walking in during a private moment could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author had a legitimate annoyance about noise disrupting their sleep and studies. But the method of dealing with it was confrontational and potentially aggressive. Even if others supported him, the act of entering her room and confronting them directly might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author used harsh language and threatened to call security, which could be seen as intimidation.\n\nThe girl's reaction\u2014calling him a cunt and asshole\u2014might be a result of feeling violated. The author's decision to tell her to move out and that no one likes her is harsh and could be considered bullying. The flatmates agreed with him, but that doesn't make the action right. Group support doesn't negate the individual's right to privacy.\n\nPossible consequences: The author could face complaints from the girl for invasion of privacy, and the flat might be in trouble if the university gets involved. Even if the noise was a problem, the appropriate steps would be to talk to her in a respectful manner, use mediators, or follow proper channels rather than taking matters into his own hands.\n\nIn summary, while the author had valid frustrations, the way he addressed the issue was invasive and confrontational. There's a better way to handle such situations without violating someone's privacy. So, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
