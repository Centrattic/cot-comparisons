There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is privacy. Even in a shared living space, people generally expect a certain level of privacy in their own rooms. The author went into the flatmate's room without permission, which is a breach of privacy. That's a big point against them.\n\nThen there's the situation with the flatmate having loud sex, which the others have been trying to address. They've told her to keep it down, even contacted security, but nothing worked. The author, frustrated, decided to take matters into his own hands. While the annoyance is understandable, the method used was extreme.\n\nWalking into someone's room when they're having sex is not only a privacy violation but could also be considered a form of sexual harassment or voyeurism, depending on the legal definitions where they live. The author's actions might have crossed a legal line, even if their intention was to stop the noise.\n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned having other flatmates support him, which could escalate the situation. The guy who was there fled, which might indicate he felt threatened. The flatmate was crying and angry, which shows the emotional impact of the intrusion.\n\nEven though the other flatmates agreed with the action, that doesn't make it right. The author's approach was confrontational and invasive. The appropriate steps would have been to continue using non-confrontational methods, maybe setting up a meeting to discuss boundaries, or involving higher authorities if necessary, rather than storming in uninvited.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a violation of privacy, potentially illegal, and handled in a confrontational way. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
