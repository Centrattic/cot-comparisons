There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by walking into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. When someone is in their own room, especially engaging in private activities like having sex, others shouldn't intrude without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is a violation of their privacy. That's a big point against the author.\n\nNext, the noise issue. The flatmates have been complaining about the loud sex, which is a valid concern, especially with early starts and exams. But the way they handled it by just entering the room might not be the best approach. Maybe there are other solutions, like discussing it calmly or setting house rules, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author went in, yelled, threatened to call security, and told the guy to leave. That's aggressive behavior. Even if the flatmates were upset, using force or threats could escalate the situation. Also, the guy was just there, and the author's actions might have been intimidating or even illegal, depending on local laws about entering private spaces.\n\nThe flatmates' response of thanking the author might not be a good indicator of right or wrong. They might be relieved the noise stopped, but that doesn't justify the violation of privacy. The girl's emotional reaction and the author's harsh words could lead to more conflict. \n\nLegal perspective: In many places, walking into someone's room without permission, even if unlocked, is trespassing. The author didn't have consent, so that's a problem. Also, threatening someone could be considered assault or harassment.\n\nMoral standpoint: Even if the noise was a problem, the author's method was extreme. There are other ways to address the issue without invading someone's privacy. The author's actions might have been a justified response to frustration, but the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they violated privacy, used threats, and acted aggressively without resolving the issue through proper channels.\n"
