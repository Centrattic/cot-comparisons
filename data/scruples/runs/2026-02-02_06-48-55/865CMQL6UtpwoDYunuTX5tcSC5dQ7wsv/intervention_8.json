There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which is disturbing others. The author and his flatmates have tried talking to her, and even involved security, but nothing changed. Now, the author, who needs to sleep for an exam the next day, goes to her room at 2am, bangs on the door, and when it's unlocked, walks in and yells at them. The guy leaves after being threatened, and the flatmate reacts angrily.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's break it down. Privacy is a big factor here. The flatmate was in her room having sex, which is a private act. The author entering without invitation, especially when doors are supposed to be a privacy boundary, could be seen as a violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to barge in uninvited. The fact that the guy was in there adds another layer because he's not a flatmate, so the author might be overstepping by confronting both of them.\n\nThen there's the threat to call security and mention the flatmates are backing him up. That's aggressive and could be intimidating. The guy was described as nervous, so the author's harsh words and threats might have been unnecessarily confrontational. Even if the flatmates are supportive, the way he handled the situation was confrontational and could be considered abusive.\n\nAlso, the author's response was to yell insults and tell the woman to move out. That's pretty extreme. The flatmate's reaction is understandable given the invasion of privacy and the verbal abuse. The fact that the flatmates thanked him afterward might indicate that they agreed with the outcome (the guy leaving), but the method he used could be problematic.\n\nPotential legal or policy issues? In some places, walking into someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, could be a privacy violation. Universities often have rules about respecting others' privacy. The author's actions might have breached those, leading to possible consequences beyond just being a social issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmate was disrupting others' sleep, which is a legitimate concern. The others had tried to resolve it but failed, so the author might feel justified. However, the solution he chose was excessive. Instead of confronting them directly and aggressively, he could have taken another approach, like using a white noise machine, leaving a more polite message, or using other non-intrusive methods.\n\nIn terms of respect and boundaries, even in a shared living space, people have the right to some privacy. The author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily. The flatmate's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's method of addressing it was not the right way. So, while the flatmate is at fault for the initial disturbance, the author's actions likely overstep the appropriate boundaries, making him the asshole as well.\n"
