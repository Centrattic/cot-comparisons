There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author lives in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys back and has loud sex, which disrupts everyone's sleep. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, went into her room when she was having sex again, told the guy to leave, and argued with her. The flatmates supported the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, witnessing them having sex, and confronting them. Legally, in many places, entering someone's private space without consent is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter without permission. The act of walking in on someone during a private moment, especially without their consent, is a serious invasion of privacy.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, but the method was extreme. Instead of finding another solution, like talking to her again, maybe involving a higher authority, or using noise complaints, the author took matters into their own hands. Physically entering the room and confronting them could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful.\n\nAdditionally, the author threatened the guy with calling security and mentioned having others back them up, which could be intimidating. Even if the flatmates agree with the action, that doesn't make it right. The girl's right to privacy is important, and the author's actions could be considered harassment or assault depending on the circumstances.\n\nThere's also the issue of the author's response\u2014calling the girl a \"piece of shit\" and telling her to leave. That's verbal abuse. Even if the girl was being a problem, the way the author handled it was excessive.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was trying to address a recurring issue that had been bothering everyone. They might feel wronged because their sleep and studies were affected. However, the method they used crossed a line. The right to privacy is a fundamental one, and entering someone's room without consent is a clear violation, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, even though the author had a valid concern, their method was inappropriate. They should have found another way to address the noise problem without invading her privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
