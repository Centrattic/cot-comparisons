There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (20M) lives in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex with partners, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her and even contacting security, but nothing worked. This time, the author, needing to wake up early, went to her door, found it unlocked, walked in during the act, told them to leave, and the guy left. The flatmate was upset, called the author names, and he left after. The flatmates supported him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy and consent. Entering someone's room without their consent is a big issue. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without permission is a violation of their privacy. The act of having sex in a shared space might be noisy and disruptive, but that doesn't justify intruding on their private moment. The author had the intention to stop the noise, but the method was extreme. The flatmate has a right to privacy in her own room. While the situation is frustrating for the other flatmates, the author's actions crossed a line. It's about respecting boundaries. Even if others are annoyed, confronting the issue in a non-intrusive way, like discussing it again or maybe involving authorities properly, would be better. So, the author is probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
