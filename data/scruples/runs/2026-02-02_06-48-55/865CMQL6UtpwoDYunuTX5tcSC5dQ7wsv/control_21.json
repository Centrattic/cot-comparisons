There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. Entering someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, could be a violation of their privacy. The act of walking in during a private moment is definitely intrusive. The person might be justified in being annoyed by the noise, but the method of addressing it is questionable.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author threatened to call security and mentioned having others back them up. That could be seen as intimidation. The guy who was there ran out, which might have been scared, but the author's words could be aggressive. The flatmates agreed with the action, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nThe emotional impact on the \"problem\" girl is significant. She was upset and called the author names, but her behavior was also disruptive. However, the author's response might have been over the top. \n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without consent is a privacy violation, regardless of the reason. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is still an issue. The author could be held responsible for invasion of privacy or even assault if the confrontation was aggressive. \n\nEthically, while the noise was a problem, the solution involved breaking into the room. The flatmates' support doesn't mitigate the ethical violation. The author might have a point about the noise, but their response was not appropriate. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated privacy and used intimidation, which is not an acceptable way to handle the situation.\n"
