There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's private space without permission, especially when they're engaged in a private act like sex, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited is a problem. The person might have a right to privacy, and the author's action could be seen as an invasion of that right.\n\nThen there's the social and moral side. The flatmates were disturbed by the loud sex, which is a common issue in shared housing. They tried to address it through communication and even involved security, but it didn't work. The author's response was to confront the situation directly, which could be seen as overstepping. However, they did mention that the flatmates supported the action, so there's a sense of collective frustration.\n\nThe immediate consequences: The girl was embarrassed, cried, and called the author names. The author's approach was confrontational and aggressive. Even if the intention was to stop the noise, the method was invasive and confrontational. The guy was asked to leave in a threatening manner, which could escalate tensions. \n\nLegal implications might include charges related to trespassing or invasion of privacy, depending on local laws. The author might not have a legal case against them, but there's a social and possibly emotional impact on the flatmate. \n\nThe flatmates' agreement with the action is a factor. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the action itself. Group support doesn't make an illegal or unethical act acceptable. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions, while motivated by frustration and a desire for peace, crossed a line by entering a private space without consent and confronting the individuals in a hostile manner. This likely makes the author at fault, hence answer A.\n"
