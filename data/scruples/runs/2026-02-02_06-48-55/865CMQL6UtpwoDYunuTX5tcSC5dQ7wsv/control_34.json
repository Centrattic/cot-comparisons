There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation is described in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post. The user (20M) lives with five others, including a female flatmate (20F) who brings guys over and has loud sex, which everyone finds annoying. They've tried telling her to be quieter, even involving security, but it didn't help. In this instance, the author went into her room without permission during an intimate moment, demanded the guy leave, and confronted her. The flatmates supported him, but the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social implications. In most places, entering someone's private room without their consent, especially during an intimate act, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give permission to enter. The act of walking in on someone having sex is a serious invasion of privacy. Legally, this could potentially be a privacy violation or even battery if the person entered without consent. Socially, it's generally frowned upon to interrupt someone's private time like that, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the noise from the flatmate's activities is disturbing their studies and rest. While that's a valid concern, the method used to address it is questionable. There are other ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries, using white noise, or discussing the issue more calmly. Confronting the flatmate in such a direct and aggressive manner by entering her room uninvited is likely to escalate the situation rather than resolve it. Even if the flatmates support the action, it doesn't make it right from a standpoint of respect and consent.\n\nThe author also threatened to call security and mentioned having others back him up, which could be seen as intimidation. While the flatmates appreciated the action because it stopped the noise, the approach used was invasive and confrontational. The girl was clearly upset and felt her privacy was invaded. The author's actions might have crossed a line, even if the motivation was to address a shared problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intentions were to stop the noise and the flatmates supported him, the method he used involved invading someone's privacy, which is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
