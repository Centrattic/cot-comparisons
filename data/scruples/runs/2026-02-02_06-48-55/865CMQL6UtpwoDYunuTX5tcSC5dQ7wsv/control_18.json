There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmates are annoyed because the girl has been having loud sex multiple times despite being asked to keep it down. They even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author, in this case, went to her room when she was having sex again, found the door unlocked, walked in, saw them, and confronted both the girl and the guy. The guy left, and the girl was upset.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? The key points are: entering someone's room without permission, interrupting a private moment, and confronting them. Even if the flatmates were annoyed, the way the author handled it might be problematic. \n\nWalking into someone's room while they're having sex is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't justify entering without being invited. The author's actions could be considered a violation of personal boundaries. Additionally, threatening the guy with calling security and using others as backup might be seen as aggressive or bullying behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to stop the noise and get some sleep, which is understandable. The other flatmates agreed with the action, so there's some support from roommates. However, the method used was confrontational and possibly illegal. \n\nIn many places, entering someone's private space while they're engaged in sexual activity, even if it's a shared living space, can be a legal issue. It could be seen as voyeurism or harassment. Also, threatening someone to leave might not be justified without a legal reason. \n\nSo, even though the author's frustration is understandable, the way they acted was inappropriate. The right approach would have been to continue communicating the issue through proper channels, even if previous attempts failed. Confronting them in such a direct and intrusive manner is where the author likely went wrong.\n"
