There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The person is a 20-year-old male in a flat with five others, including a 20-year-old female flatmate who brings guys over and has loud sex despite being asked to keep it down. The user's friends told security, who didn't help. The author went to her room after she was having sex again, found the door unlocked, entered, and then confronted them, leading to a confrontation where he tells the guy to leave or else he'll call security with four other flatmates backing him up. The girl gets upset and calls him names, and the others in the flat agreed with him and thanked him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, entering someone's room without permission, even if it's unlocked, is a privacy violation. That's a big point. Then, the noise issue: while it's common to have noise complaints in shared living, the author's approach here was to walk in during an intimate moment. Even if the door was unlocked, the fact that they were having sex means they probably expected privacy. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the noise problem. \n\nBut maybe the context matters. The girl was already known for being disruptive, and the others had tried other avenues (telling her, telling security) without success. The author took matters into his own hands. However, the method of confrontation is aggressive and potentially threatening. Telling the guy to leave with the implication that they have more people to support their claim\u2014this might be intimidating. Also, the emotional impact on the woman, who was upset and called the author names, suggests that his approach was harsh. \n\nLegal considerations: In many places, entering a private room without permission, even if unlocked, is a violation of privacy. The author could be at fault for that. Also, threatening someone with a call to security unless they comply could be seen as harassment. The flatmates' support doesn't necessarily make it right, because the others might not be in a position to enforce such actions. \n\nEthically, even if the noise is a problem, the way the author addressed it was confrontational and violated the woman's privacy. There might be a better way to handle it, like using white noise machines or setting up a more respectful agreement about quiet hours. \n\nThe guy who was having sex might not have been aware of the flat rules, but the author's reaction to him seems harsh as well. The guy was described as nervous and left after being threatened. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, while driven by frustration over noise and his flatmates' agreement, still involved entering a private space without consent and confrontation during a private act. That's likely to be considered wrong, even if there's a valid complaint about the noise. The right answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation and aggressive behavior.\n"
