There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author, a 20-year-old male, lives in a flat with five others. The female flatmate frequently brings guys home and has loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried communicating through the flat chat and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author was up late again, had an early start, and decided to confront the situation by entering her room when they found it unlocked.\n\nNow, the key issue here is the act of walking into someone's private space without consent, even if the door was unlocked. Privacy is a big deal, especially in shared living situations. Even if the door wasn't locked, entering someone's room uninvited during a private moment like sex is a violation of their privacy. The author's actions, while motivated by annoyance and a desire for quiet, cross a line. \n\nThe author claims that the guy was scared and left after being threatened with security and the support of other flatmates. But the immediate act of entering the room without permission is the primary issue here. It's not just about the loud sex; it's about the invasion of privacy. Even if others were annoyed, the solution of entering the room and confronting them in that moment is not appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author was in a post-sex situation, which is a vulnerable time for the individuals involved. The emotional response from the flatmate, including crying and verbal abuse, indicates the trauma of the situation. The author's actions could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful, regardless of the prior grievances.\n\nWhile the flatmates agreed with the author afterward, that doesn't justify the violation of privacy. Collective agreement doesn't make an individual's actions right if they infringe on someone else's rights. The proper approach would be to address the issue through more appropriate channels, like involving the university's housing policies or mediation, rather than taking matters into one's own hands.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to enter the room and confront the flatmate in that manner is a breach of privacy. The motivation might be understandable, but the method is inexcusable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
