There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here.\n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. The person might have a case for invasion of privacy, depending on the local laws. In many places, you can't just walk into someone's private space like that, regardless of the reason.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author was annoyed by the noise, which is understandable. But the way they handled it was confrontational. Instead of addressing the issue through proper channels\u2014like talking to the flatmate calmly, using mediation, or maybe contacting the university housing office\u2014they took matters into their own hands. That escalated the situation. The flatmates might support them emotionally because they were also annoyed, but that doesn't make the action right.\n\nAlso, threatening to call security and implying that their word against the other person's isn't a good approach. It could be seen as intimidation. The guy who was there was just a third party; the main issue is between the author and the flatmate. Telling the guy to leave and threatening him might add to the problem.\n\nThe flatmates thanked the author, but their gratitude doesn't override the fact that the action was a breach of privacy. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could lead to more conflict. Even if the noise was an ongoing issue, there are more appropriate ways to handle it without invading someone's privacy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. They violated the flatmate's privacy, used aggressive language, and took a confrontational approach that could have legal repercussions. The right thing would have been to address the noise issue through proper channels rather than storming into the room.\n"
