There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author (20M) is in a shared flat with five others. The female flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've tried telling her, even reporting to security, but nothing changed. Then, one night when she's doing it again, the author goes to her room, finds it unlocked, walks in, sees them having sex, and confronts both parties. The guy leaves after being threatened, and the girl is upset. The author's flatmates agreed with him.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, walking into someone's room without permission could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space while they're engaged in intimate activity is a big deal. The act of interrupting their sex without consent is a privacy violation. Even if the others were annoyed, the author's method of dealing with it was confrontational and possibly aggressive. \n\nThe author's justification is that they were disturbed and needed to get some sleep. However, there are other ways to handle the situation, like using earplugs, talking to the person again, or maybe even legal steps if the noise was a consistent issue. But instead, he took matters into his own hands, which led to a confrontational scene. \n\nThe man being short and skinny might not be a threat, but the author's threat to call security and mention having four flatmates to back him up could be intimidating. The girl was crying and upset, which suggests that the author's actions were hurtful and possibly aggressive. \n\nAlso, the flatmates thanking him might indicate that the others didn't consider the actions wrong, but that doesn't make it right. The author's actions could have legal repercussions if the flatmate files a complaint, regardless of the flatmates' opinions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even in a shared living space, respecting each other's privacy is important. While it's understandable that the noise was a problem, the way the author addressed it was extreme. The threat of calling security and the confrontational language (\"piece of shit\", \"move out\") could be seen as hostile and disrespectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted in a way that violated the privacy of the flatmate and her partner. Even if the situation was frustrating, the method used was inappropriate and could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
