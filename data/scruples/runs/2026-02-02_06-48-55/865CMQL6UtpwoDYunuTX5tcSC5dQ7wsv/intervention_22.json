There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The person (20M) is living in a shared flat with five others. The issue is that the female flatmate brings guys over and has loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. This time, after another incident, the author went to her room, found them having sex, and forced the guy to leave.\n\nHmm, so the main question is about privacy and respecting boundaries. Even if the loud sex is annoying, walking into someone's room without permission is a big breach of privacy. The author argues that it's disruptive, but others have a right to privacy in their own rooms. The author didn't knock properly, wait for a response, or try to resolve it calmly. Instead, they barged in and confronted them. Even if the others are upset, using such a confrontational approach, especially in the heat of the moment, might be considered overstepping. The guy in the room didn't do anything threatening, and the author threatened to call security, which could be seen as aggressive. The flatmates agreed with the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was the right thing. Respect for privacy is important even if there's a conflict. So the answer might be A because the author violated privacy and used aggressive behavior.\n"
