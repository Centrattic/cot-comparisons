There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is privacy. When someone is having sex, even if they're in a shared living space, they generally expect a certain level of privacy. The author walked in without being invited and even after the door was unlocked. That's a big privacy violation. Even if the flatmate was being loud, entering someone's room uninvited while they're engaged in private activity isn't right. \n\nThe flatmates had tried other methods like talking to her and even involving security, but those didn't work. But that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. The author could have handled it differently, like setting up a sign or using a camera to monitor noise, but instead chose to confront the situation directly by entering. \n\nAlso, the author then refused to leave and made threats. That's not just a privacy issue but could be considered harassment or even a form of assault if the guy was threatened. The guy ran out after the author threatened to call security and mentioned other flatmates as witnesses. That could be seen as intimidation.\n\nEven if the flatmates are angry about the noise, the method the author used was extreme. The author could have faced consequences like legal action from the flatmate or the guy. Privacy rights are important, and the author's actions, while motivated by frustration, crossed a line. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
