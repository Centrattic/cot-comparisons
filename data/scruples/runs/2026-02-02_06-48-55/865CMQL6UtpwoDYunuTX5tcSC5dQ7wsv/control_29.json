There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: they live in a shared flat with five others. The girl in question is bringing guys back and having loud sex, which disturbs everyone. They've tried telling her, even involved security, but it didn't help. Then, when it happens again, the author goes to her room at 2am, finds them having sex, and confronts them.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the act of entering someone's room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without knocking properly or waiting for a response is a privacy invasion. People have a right to privacy, especially in their own rooms. The act of entering during such an intimate moment is a big deal. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, which others were also annoyed about. But the method he used was confrontational and confrontational to the point of being aggressive. He didn't just ask them to stop; he entered, confronted them, told the guy to leave, and then told the girl to move out. His language was very harsh, using words like \"piece of shit\" and \"asshole,\" which could escalate the situation.\n\nEven though the flatmates thanked him afterward, that doesn't necessarily make his actions right. The question is about whether he was in the wrong. Legally, entering someone's private space without permission could be an issue, regardless of the reason. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries. Even if the girl was being disruptive, the proper approach might have been to talk to her calmly, maybe set up a meeting, or involve authorities properly, not to storm in during an intimate moment.\n\nThe guy he told to leave might have had rights too. The author's threat of calling security with others backing up could be seen as intimidation. Also, the girl was crying afterward, which shows the emotional impact of his actions.\n\nSo, while the author had valid frustrations, his method of dealing with it crossed a line. He violated the privacy of his flatmate and the other person involved in the act. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
