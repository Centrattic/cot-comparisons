There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 20-year-old male, lives in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys over and has loud sex. This has been a recurring issue, and the flatmates have tried to address it by talking to her and even security, but it hasn't stopped. In this particular incident, the author confronts her again, ends up entering her room when the door is unlocked, sees them having sex, and then tells the guy to leave, leading to an argument.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal and ethical standpoint, entering someone's private room without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, the room is their private space, and entering it during a sexual act is a serious breach. The author's actions could be considered an invasion of privacy, which is a significant issue regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHowever, there are arguments on both sides. The flatmates have been disturbed by the noise, and they've tried to address it through normal channels without success. The author might feel that the situation was becoming unmanageable and that this was a last resort. But even so, the method of confrontation\u2014entering the room uninvited and then refusing to leave\u2014crosses a line. \n\nLegally, in many places, walking in on someone having sex in their private residence without their consent could lead to legal consequences for the intruder. The author's actions could be seen as voyeurism, which is illegal. Additionally, threatening to call security and using others as witnesses might be seen as intimidation. \n\nOn the ethical side, even if the author was frustrated, there are more appropriate ways to handle the situation. Confronting the person outside of the private moment, using a doorbell or knocking and waiting, or involving a mediator instead of acting impulsively. The fact that the author was thanked by other flatmates might suggest that they're sympathetic to his frustration, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. \n\nThe key points here are privacy rights and the method of addressing the problem. Even if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the author's response could be seen as an overstep that infringes on her rights. So, in this case, the author probably is in the wrong (A) because entering someone's private room during a sexual act is a violation of privacy, regardless of the reasons.\n"
