There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the context: the flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried telling her and even contacted security, but nothing worked. The situation escalates when the author decides to confront her by entering the room without permission. \n\nNow, the main issue is that the author walked into the room uninvited while the flatmate and her partner were having sex. Legally and ethically, entering someone's private space without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the others were annoyed, the method used was extreme. The author didn't just knock and ask to discuss; they forced entry and confrontationally told the guy to leave. \n\nThe flatmate's reaction was understandable\u2014she was in a vulnerable situation, and the intrusion was shocking. The author's verbal aggression and the threat to call security with others as backup might be seen as overstepping. While the flatmates are upset about the noise, the author's actions could be considered an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to stop the noise and protect their right to sleep. The flatmates did support the action afterward, but that doesn't necessarily justify the violation of privacy. There might have been better ways to address the issue without such a confrontation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the flatmate should have been considerate of others by keeping the noise down, but the author's method of handling it was inappropriate. The key here is the violation of privacy regardless of the motivation. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the flatmate's privacy despite the valid annoyance.\n"
