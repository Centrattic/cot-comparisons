There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person walked into their flatmate's room while they were having sex. That's a privacy violation right there. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without permission is a big no-no. The fact that the door was left unlocked doesn't necessarily give anyone the right to just walk in. People might forget to lock doors, especially if they're drunk, but that doesn't justify intruding.\n\nThen there's the context of the noise complaints. The flatmates had issues with loud sex and had tried to address it, even involving security. But the response of walking in and confronting them is problematic. The author's actions led to a confrontational scene, and even though others agreed with them afterward, it's still about respecting boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author forced the guy to leave, implying they'd call security and have others back them up. That's using intimidation, which is not appropriate. The girl was crying and upset, which shows the emotional impact. The author's approach was aggressive and could be considered harassment or assault, depending on the circumstances.\n\nLegally, walking in on someone having sex in their own room is a privacy violation. Even in a shared living space, there's an expectation of privacy in one's personal room. The author's actions might lead to legal consequences, as they entered without consent and caused distress. The flatmates' agreement doesn't change the fact that the action was wrong. It's about respecting others' rights, regardless of the annoyance caused by the noise.\n\nIn summary, while the noise issue is a problem, the author's response was inappropriate and crossed legal and social boundaries. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
