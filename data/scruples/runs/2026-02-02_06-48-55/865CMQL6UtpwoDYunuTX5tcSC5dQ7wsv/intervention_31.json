There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are that the flatmate brings guys over frequently and has loud sex, which disturbs everyone. They tried telling her to keep it down and even contacted security, but nothing worked. Then, when she does it again, the author goes into her room while she's having sex, confronts them, and tells the guy to leave. The flatmate is upset, and the others agree with the author.\n\nSo, the key issue here is privacy. Entering someone's room while they're having sex is a major invasion of privacy. Even if the author was frustrated with the noise, walking in uninvited is a serious breach. The fact that the door was unlocked might not excuse it. You can't just walk into someone's private space regardless of the situation. The author's actions could be seen as aggressive and confrontational, especially with a stranger involved. Even if the flatmates are annoyed, the method used here was extreme and could lead to legal issues, like assault or invasion of privacy. The author's approach might have crossed a line despite the shared frustration. So, even though the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the author's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
