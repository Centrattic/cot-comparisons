There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 20-year-old male who lives with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys over and has loud sex despite prior complaints. The author, frustrated, barges into the room, sees them having sex, and demands the guy leave, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's private space without permission, especially when they're engaged in intimate activities, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door wasn't locked, entering without consent might be trespassing or invasion of privacy. The flatmate might have a right to privacy in her own room, and the author's actions could be seen as a breach of that.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical side. The author's intention was to stop noise, which is a valid concern, but the method was confrontational and intrusive. Instead of confronting them directly, other measures like using earplugs, talking to the flatmate more calmly, or involving a mediator could have been better. The way the author handled it\u2014being aggressive, confronting the guy, and telling the flatmate to leave\u2014might be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author mentions that the flatmates thanked him, but that's a group of people who may have shared his frustration. However, just because others agreed doesn't make it right. The flatmate's feelings and rights still matter. The author's response could escalate tensions and create a hostile living environment.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to call security and mention having \"4 other flatmates to back me up\" could be seen as coercive and intimidating. This might not be a fair approach, as the guy was just there for sex and didn't pose a threat. The author's reaction seems excessive, given that the main issue was noise, not safety.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the flatmate who brings people over and makes noise should consider others' needs, but the author's method of addressing it was confrontational and possibly illegal. There's a balance between respecting privacy and addressing shared concerns. The author might have known the room was unlocked, but that doesn't justify entering without permission.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely acted in a way that violated the flatmate's privacy and used aggressive tactics. While the noise issue is valid, the approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
