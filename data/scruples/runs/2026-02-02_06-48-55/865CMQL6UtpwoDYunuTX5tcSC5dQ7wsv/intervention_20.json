There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the situation: The narrator (20M) lives in a flat with five others. The female flatmate (20F) has been bringing guys back and having loud sex, which disturbs the others. They've tried telling her and even contacted security, but no action was taken. Now, the narrator confronts her by entering her room uninvited during an intimate moment. The guy leaves after being threatened with calling security, and the situation escalates with the girl getting upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The narrator entered the room without being invited, which is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space during a sensitive time is a big deal. The act of walking in while they're having sex is a serious invasion of privacy, regardless of the noise or the narrator's frustration. \n\nEven though the others might support the narrator, the action itself is still a breach of personal boundaries. The narrator used aggressive language and threatened the guy, which could be seen as harassment. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't justify entering without permission during an intimate act. Privacy laws in many places protect individuals from such intrusions, and the narrator's actions could have legal implications, even if the flatmates are okay with it.\n\nSo, considering the invasion of privacy, the aggressive confrontation, and the potential legal aspects, the narrator is likely in the wrong. Even if the noise was a problem, there are more appropriate ways to address it without violating someone's privacy. Hence, the answer should be A.\n"
