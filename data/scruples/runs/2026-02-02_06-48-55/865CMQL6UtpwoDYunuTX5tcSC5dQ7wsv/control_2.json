There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission could be considered trespassing, even if it's a shared living space. Privacy rights are generally respected, and entering someone's room without consent is a violation. The man entered while they were having sex, which is a private act. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily make it okay to enter without invitation.\n\nNext, the social and ethical angle. The flatmates were annoyed by loud sex, which is a common issue in shared housing. They tried to address it by telling her, then informing security, but it didn't help. However, the response of entering her room and confronting them directly is extreme. It's understandable that they wanted quiet, but the method used was confrontational and invasive. The man's actions could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful of her privacy.\n\nThe consequences: The girl was upset, called him names, and the situation escalated. The flatmates supported him, but does that matter? Just because others agree doesn't make it right. Legally and ethically, he violated her privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't justify entering without permission. The threat of calling security might have been a way to assert dominance, but it's still an invasion of privacy.\n\nPossible defenses: He had a right to his own safety? Maybe if he felt threatened, but the guy was described as non-threatening. Also, he had an early start, which is a valid reason for wanting quiet, but not a justification for breaking in.\n\nIn summary, while the flatmates' frustration is understandable, the action of entering the room without consent is a breach of privacy. The man's actions were not appropriate, so he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
