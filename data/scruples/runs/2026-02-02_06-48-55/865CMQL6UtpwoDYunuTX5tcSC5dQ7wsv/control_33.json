There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate has been having loud sex multiple times, which is disturbing the others. They tried to address it through the flat chat and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, decides to confront the situation by barging in. \n\nSo, the main issue here is entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're having private sex. Privacy is a big deal. Even if the others are annoyed by the noise, walking in without consent is a violation of that privacy. The author might have been trying to stop the noise, but the method was extreme.\n\nThe author had an early start, but that's not an excuse for invading someone's privacy. The guy was there, and the author told him to leave, which might be seen as harassment. Also, the threat of calling security and using others as backup could be seen as intimidation. The flatmates agreed with the author, but legally and ethically, entering a private space without permission is wrong, regardless of the reason. \n\nThe consequences include the flatmate feeling disrespected and the potential for conflict. Even if the others were annoyed, the author's actions escalate the situation. It's important to handle disputes through proper channels rather than taking matters into one's own hands. So, the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
