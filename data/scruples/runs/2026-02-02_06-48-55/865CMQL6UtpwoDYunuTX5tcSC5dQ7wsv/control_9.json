There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and then refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate is having loud sex frequently, which is disturbing everyone else. The roommates have tried to talk to her, even involved security, but she didn't change her behavior. The author had an early start and was trying to sleep, so when this happened again, he went to her room.\n\nHe knocked, she didn't open, then he forced entry because the door was unlocked. He saw them having sex, confronted her and the guy. He told the guy to leave, and the guy left after being threatened with calling security. The flatmate was upset, called him names, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nNow, the key points here: entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're having private activities. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited is a violation of privacy. The author used force initially by knocking and then entering. \n\nHe interrupted a private act, which is a clear breach of personal space. Even if the others are annoyed, confronting someone in such a situation can be seen as inappropriate. The author's actions could be considered trespassing and invasion of privacy. Additionally, threatening the guy with security and using others as backup might escalate the situation.\n\nBut the flatmates supported him, saying they thanked him for getting to sleep. However, legal and ethical standards usually side with privacy rights. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without consent, especially during a private moment, is wrong. The fact that he walked in on them having sex is a major privacy issue. \n\nSo, even though the flatmate's actions were disturbing, the author's response was not the right approach. He should have found another way to address the noise, like using noise complaints, moving to a different room, or involving higher authorities. His entry and confrontation crossed the line into invasion of privacy and possibly assault if he forced his way in.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because he violated the flatmate's privacy by entering without permission during a private act, regardless of the prior annoyances.\n"
