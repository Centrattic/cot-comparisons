There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author walking into their flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and consent. The user (20M) went into his flatmate's room without her permission. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to barge in. People have a right to privacy, especially in their own room, even if they're in a shared living space. So, entering without permission is a breach of privacy.\n\nNext, the context given is that the flatmates have asked her to keep noise down, but they didn't get security involved effectively. The author's action was to confront her in a very direct and confrontational way. While the noise issue is valid, the solution might not be to intrude on her privacy. Using force or threatening to call security could be seen as overstepping, even if others support the action.\n\nAlso, the author is using aggressive language and threatening behavior. Telling the guy to leave and implying they can back him up with others could be seen as bullying. The flatmate's response of crying and anger is understandable given the invasion of her private moment.\n\nEven though the flatmates thanked him, the method he used is problematic. The right approach might have been to address the noise issue through proper channels, like talking directly with her again, perhaps setting up a mutual agreement, or involving higher authorities if needed, but not intruding into her personal space.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did act in the wrong by invading her privacy and using aggressive tactics. The answer would be A.\n"
