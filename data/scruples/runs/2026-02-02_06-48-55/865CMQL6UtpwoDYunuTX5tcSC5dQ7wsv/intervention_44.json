There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of university students living together. The main issue is the flatmate having loud sex, which the others are annoyed by. They've tried to talk to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author then decided to confront her by entering her room while she was having sex again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's room while they're having sex, even if it's a shared living space, could be considered a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission and interrupting such a private act might be seen as a breach of their right to privacy. There's also the potential for sexual misconduct charges, like voyeurism, depending on the jurisdiction. The author's actions could be legally problematic regardless of the intention.\n\nNext, the social and ethical angle. While the other flatmates were annoyed by the noise, the author's choice to confront the situation by entering the room is extreme. They could have used other methods, like using earplugs, talking to her again more firmly, or discussing with the landlord. Instead, they chose a confrontational approach that escalated the situation. The author's response of threatening to call security and using aggressive language might be seen as overreacting, even if the others supported them afterward.\n\nAnother point is the immediate action taken. The author didn't give the couple a chance to stop the activity themselves. They just barged in, which could have been dangerous. The guy was described as a stranger, and the author's threat to involve others might have put that person in a vulnerable position. The emotional response of the flatmate, crying and being upset, suggests that the intrusion was traumatic for her.\n\nAlso, the flatmates' agreement with the author's action might not necessarily make it right. Group consensus doesn't excuse a violation of someone's privacy or potential legal issues. The fact that they thanked him could be more about relief from the noise rather than an endorsement of the method used.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, the author could have considered other solutions. For example, using white noise machines, setting up a flat agreement about quiet hours, or seeking mediation through the university housing office. These would address the noise issue without invading someone's privacy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author had a legitimate grievance about the noise, the method used was inappropriate and invasive. It's important to balance personal privacy with the needs of a shared living environment. The author's actions crossed a line, making them responsible for the intrusion and potential harm caused.\n"
