There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 20-year-old male, lives in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex with guys, disrupting the others. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. On this particular night, after she had sex again, the author went into her room, saw them, and confronts them. The guy left after being threatened with calling security, and the author told the girl to move out.\n\nNow, the key issues here are invasion of privacy, consent, and appropriate conflict resolution. Walking into someone's room without permission, especially while they're having sex, is a clear breach of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited is a problem. The author's actions could be considered a violation of the flatmate's privacy, regardless of the noise issue.\n\nThe author had an issue with the noise, which is a valid concern. However, the way he addressed it was extreme. Instead of using non-confrontational methods, like talking to her again or maybe using a white noise machine, he chose to storm into her room. This escalates the situation and could be seen as aggressive. \n\nAlso, the author's verbal aggression\u2014calling her names and threatening the guy\u2014might be problematic. Even if the flatmates support him, it doesn't make the action right. There's a line between standing up for oneself and causing harm. \n\nAnother angle is that entering someone's private space without consent can be a legal issue. Depending on the country, this could be considered voyeurism or harassment. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is a violation. \n\nThe flatmate's reaction (crying and yelling) suggests that the author caused emotional distress. The fact that the others thanked him doesn't negate the wrongfulness of his actions. Just because others agree doesn't mean it's right. \n\nIn terms of conflict resolution, the author didn't handle the situation calmly. He could have called security or documented the noise issue again. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which might lead to further conflict or legal problems.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the noise was an issue, the method of dealing with it was inappropriate. The author violated the flatmate's privacy and used aggressive language. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
