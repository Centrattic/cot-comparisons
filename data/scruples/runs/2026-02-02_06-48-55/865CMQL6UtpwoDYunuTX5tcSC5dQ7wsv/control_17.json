There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. The author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's had issues with loud sex. They've tried telling her before, even contacting security, but nothing worked. Then, when she does it again, he goes into her room, sees them, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and yells at her. The flatmates support him. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions step by step. The key points here are privacy, consent, and the right to a peaceful living environment. The author entered the room without being invited, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in uninvited. The couple was in the middle of an intimate act, and interrupting that could be considered a violation of their privacy.\n\nEven though the flatmates were annoyed by the noise and had tried to address it, the author's solution was to confront them directly, which escalated the situation. The guy who was there might have been there consensually, and the author's threat to call security (with other flatmates backing him) could be seen as intimidating. The fact that the guy left after being threatened might be because he felt intimidated, not because it was the right thing to do. \n\nThe author's response was aggressive and confrontational. Yelling, calling her names, and ordering people to leave without giving them a chance to respond could be seen as overstepping. While the other flatmates supported him, their support doesn't validate the action if it was against general norms or rules. \n\nIn most social and legal contexts, entering someone's private space without their consent is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the noise was a problem, the appropriate course of action would be to address it through communication, involve the appropriate authorities, or take legal steps if necessary. Confronting someone in such an intimate situation is likely to be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inappropriate. He violated the privacy of the flatmate and her partner, used aggressive language, and threatened them. Even if the other flatmates agreed with his actions, it doesn't make it right from a broader perspective. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
