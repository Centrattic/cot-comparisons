It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions during the family dinner. The situation involves the author's sister bringing up the author's ex, which the author found uncomfortable because their family was previously unkind to their ex. The author then responds by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister brought up the author's ex and made negative comments. The author felt this was hurtful, given their family's past harsh treatment of their ex. The author's response was to turn the conversation back on the family by asking them to talk about their own exes, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and how to handle sensitive topics. The sister's comments might have been intrusive or judgmental. The author's reaction was a direct challenge, which might have been a way to set a boundary. But is that appropriate?\n\nIn social interactions, there's an expectation of respect. If someone feels uncomfortable, they have the right to address it. However, the method of response matters. The author's approach was confrontational, using sarcasm and redirecting the conversation. While it's valid to feel upset, the way they addressed it might have been seen as defensive or aggressive, escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's side might have thought they were being honest or sharing memories, not realizing how it affected the author. But the author's ex was mentioned in a negative light, which could be seen as unkind. Still, the author's response was a bit of a counterattack, which might not be the most constructive way to handle it.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, they were in their right to feel upset and to express that. However, their method of confrontation might not have been the best. A more constructive approach could have been to explain their feelings and ask the sister to stop the conversation. By bringing up the family's exes, especially the sister's ex who is still married, the author might have overstepped, adding fuel to the fire. The sister's ex (her ex-husband) is a sensitive topic, and bringing that up could be seen as personal.\n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were defending themselves against a topic that was making them uncomfortable. But their approach was arguably inappropriate. So, the answer might be a mix, but according to the options given (A or B), the best choice is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction, while understandable, was not the most respectful or diplomatic way to handle the situation. They contributed to the conflict by being confrontational instead of setting a boundary in a calm manner. Alternatively, if the sister's comments were clearly unkind, the author might have been justified, but the method still matters.\n"
