It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family dinner where the author felt uncomfortable when their sister and parents were talking about their ex. The author responded by turning the conversation to others' exes, which led to an argument and the dinner being ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's sister and parents were discussing the author's ex, which the author found offensive. They felt that their family had been unkind to their ex in the past, and now the sister was bringing it up again. The author's reaction was to call out the dinner as the \"portion\" for talking about exes and ask others to do the same. This caused tension because others' exes might be sensitive topics too, especially with their current partners present.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to feel hurt. Their family's past criticism of their ex had left lasting feelings of sadness and anger. Being brought up again in a negative light could be triggering. The author's response was a way to deflect and point out the inconsistency\u2014why is it okay to talk about my ex but not yours?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was abrupt and public. By loudly shifting the conversation to others' exes, they potentially embarrassed others and created an uncomfortable atmosphere. It's possible that others in the family had their own past relationships they'd rather not discuss, especially with current partners present. The author's approach might have been defensive and not the best way to handle the situation. Instead of confronting the issue head-on, they used a tactic that could be seen as deflecting blame rather than addressing the root problem.\n\nBut then again, the original problem was initiated by the sister and parents bringing up the ex without consent. The author might have felt attacked and was trying to set boundaries. However, the method used was confrontational and might not have been the most effective. A better approach could have been to calmly express their feelings to the sister and parents privately after the dinner instead of during the event, which could have defused the situation without causing a scene.\n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to stop the conversation about their ex, which was justified. However, the impact was that they shifted the focus to others, which might not have been fair. It's possible that others didn't mean to make the author feel bad, but the author's reaction escalated things. The author might have overreacted in a way that caused more harm than good, even if their feelings were valid.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, bringing up someone's ex can be sensitive, especially if done in a negative light. The author's sister might not have realized how hurtful the comments were, but the author's response of flipping the script could be seen as confrontational. It's a bit of a \"do to others as they did to you\" approach, which can backfire because not everyone has the same level of comfort discussing their past.\n\nSo, while the author has a point about not wanting to talk about their ex, their method of handling it by forcing others to do the same might not be fair. It's more about the approach rather than the intent. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the situation more gracefully, even if their feelings are valid.\n"
