It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family dinner where the author's sister and parents were talking negatively about the author's ex, which the author found hurtful. The author then responded by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, which led to a confrontation and the dinner ending in an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's sister and parents were bringing up the ex, which the author was still sensitive about because of past family criticism. The author felt targeted and tried to redirect by including others' exes. The family was upset because the author confronted them in a group setting, which might have been seen as rude.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the family's previous behavior. The author mentions that the family was unkind to their ex in the past, and the sister continued this by making negative comments. The author, feeling attacked, used a confrontational response to highlight the inconsistency. However, the author's approach was public and might have escalated the situation instead of addressing it privately.\n\nNow, considering etiquette, bringing up exes can be sensitive, especially if the current partners are present. The author's sister initiating the discussion about the author's ex was perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's response of publicly calling out everyone's exes in a group setting might have been too aggressive. The author's intent was to point out the unfairness, but the method was confrontational, leading to a breakdown in the dinner.\n\nThe author might argue that the family started the conversation, so they were just defending themselves. However, the appropriate response might have been to address the issue privately after the dinner rather than in the moment. Public confrontations can lead to arguments and hurt feelings, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel that the author overreacted by turning the conversation into a group discussion, which could have made others uncomfortable, especially since the sister's current boyfriend was present. The author's fianc\u00e9 and sister's boyfriend were silent, which might indicate that the topic was indeed sensitive and not everyone wanted to engage.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some fault. The family brought up a sensitive topic, and the author responded in a way that escalated the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's response was a direct challenge in a public setting, which is generally considered inappropriate, they might be at fault. However, if the family was indeed being unfair, the author's reaction stems from valid hurt feelings, but the method was not the best approach.\n\nThe story mentions that the author isn't proud of their actions but felt justified. The family asked for an apology, but the author refuses, seeing it as a mutual issue. The answer hinges on whether the author's public confrontation was inexcusable regardless of the context.\n"
