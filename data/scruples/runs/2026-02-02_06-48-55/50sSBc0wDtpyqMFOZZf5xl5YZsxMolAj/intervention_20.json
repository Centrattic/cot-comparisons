It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is at a family dinner where their sister and parents start talking about the author's ex in a negative way. The author then responds by suggesting everyone should talk about their exes, including the family members. This leads to an argument and the author leaves with their fianc\u00e9. Now, they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to analyze the situation from both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a history of being criticized by their family about their ex, which caused them emotional pain. When the sister brings it up again, the author feels targeted. Their response is defensive, trying to shift the focus to others' exes. This could be seen as a valid reaction to being unfairly criticized, especially since the author's ex was described negatively even though the author defends them. The author's main point is that it's inappropriate to discuss someone's ex when their current partner is present, which is a reasonable perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might have been a bit aggressive. By bringing up everyone else's exes, they might have escalated the situation instead of addressing the issue calmly. Even though they felt wronged, interrupting the discussion and making it about others could have been perceived as deflecting rather than confronting the problem head-on. Also, the fact that they left the table might have made it seem like they were avoiding the conversation rather than engaging.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014the author had past trauma from the family's treatment of their ex, and this situation was a trigger\u2014it's understandable that they reacted strongly. The family's comments were hurtful, and the author's response was a way to defend themselves and their ex. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If the sister and parents were in the wrong for bringing up the ex in a negative light, then the author's response, while perhaps not the most tactful, was a form of standing up for themselves.\n\nI think the answer is not straightforward. Both sides have valid points. However, since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that the author's response might have been a justified defense against unfair criticism, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a chance that the author's method could be seen as inconsiderate, hence A. However, given the emotional history, B might be more accurate.\n"
