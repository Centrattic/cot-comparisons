It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author felt their ex was being criticized by their sister and parents. In response, the author called out the family for bringing up exes and suggested others do the same, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's family brought up the ex, which the author found hurtful because of past criticism. The author's reaction was to flip the script by pointing out that others could also discuss their exes. The key points are intent and proportionality. \n\nWas the author justified in their reaction? The family started the conversation about exes, which the author found uncomfortable. However, the author's response was to escalate the situation by making others uncomfortable as well. By inviting others to talk about their exes, the author might have overreacted, especially since the sister and parents were the ones who initiated the discussion. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as a form of retaliation. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they turned the conversation into a broader discussion that might have embarrassed others, including the sister and parents. This could be considered inconsiderate, as it's possible others don't want their past relationships discussed either. The argument that it's a \"you can serve it but not take it\" situation is valid, but the author's approach might not have been the best way to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, the family did initiate the discussion in a way that made the author uncomfortable. The author had a right to set boundaries. However, the method they used\u2014calling out the family in a public and confrontational manner\u2014might have been inappropriate. A more constructive approach, like addressing the issue privately or changing the subject, might have been better. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's reaction was a defensive response to family members who brought up a sensitive topic. However, their method of responding could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially hurtful. Even though the family started the conversation, the author's response might have been an overreaction that escalated the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if they had valid reasons for feeling upset.\n"
