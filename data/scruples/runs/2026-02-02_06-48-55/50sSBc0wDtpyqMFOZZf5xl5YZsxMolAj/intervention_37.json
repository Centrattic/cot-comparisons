It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author's sister brought up their ex, leading to the author calling out everyone for talking about their exes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of being criticized by their family about their ex, which was hurtful. When the sister brings up the ex again, the author reacts by suggesting others talk about their exes as well. The author's intention here is to highlight the inconsistency\u2014why is it okay to discuss their exes but not theirs?\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction was defensive. They felt targeted and used a confrontational approach to even the playing field. However, this approach led to a ruined dinner and arguments. The author's sister might have only mentioned the ex in passing, but the author's response was aggressive, which could be seen as overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons for being upset. Their family has a history of being unkind about their past, and being in a room with their current partner might have made them more sensitive. The author's comment was a way to push back against the one-sided criticism, even if the method was not the best.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author's reaction disproportionate? Did the family have a right to bring up the ex? The sister's initial comment might have been innocuous, but given the history, it's understandable that the author felt defensive. However, responding by calling out everyone's exes in the room might have been a way to deflect, but it could also be seen as deflecting from the actual issue. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister and parents might be at fault for bringing up the ex without considering the author's feelings, but the author's response escalated the situation. The author could have addressed it more calmly, perhaps expressing discomfort without turning it into a group discussion. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, their reaction might have been inappropriate in the context of a family dinner. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be seen as contributing to the conflict. However, the family's initial action was also problematic. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction was justified given their history. If the family was consistently unkind, the author's defensiveness is more understandable. But in the moment, their approach might have been too aggressive, making them partially responsible.\n"
