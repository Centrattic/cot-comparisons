It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author's sister and parents brought up their exes, leading to the author flipping the script by asking others to do the same. The author then left the dinner, and now they're wondering if they were at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author was uncomfortable with their ex being discussed negatively, especially since past family members had been unkind about that ex. The sister and parents continued talking about the ex, which the author found offensive. In response, the author called out the others by asking them to share their own exes, which caused an argument and the dinner ended.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the appropriateness of their reaction. The sister and parents were bringing up the author's ex in a way that was hurtful, given past family reactions. The author felt attacked and decided to confront this by making others uncomfortable as well. \n\nNow, was the author wrong? Well, the initial act of the family members bringing up the ex might have been insensitive, but the author's response was to escalate the situation. By publicly calling others out and forcing them to discuss their own exes, the author might have overstepped. While the author had valid reasons for feeling hurt, the method they used to address it could be seen as confrontational and perhaps inconsiderate of the group setting. \n\nHowever, the author's main point is about the double standard\u2014why is it okay to talk about someone else's ex but not their own? That's a valid criticism. But in a family setting, especially when emotions are involved, the way to address it might matter more. The author's reaction led to ruining the dinner, so even if the family was at fault first, the author's response could be seen as causing the immediate problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were defending themselves against unfair treatment. The family members started the discussion, and the author's reaction was a form of self-defense in a way. But in terms of social etiquette, being confrontational in a group like that might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong because they were reacting to a provocation, but their method of response could have been more diplomatic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), it's a bit tricky. The family's behavior was perhaps worse, but the author's action caused the immediate fallout. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their response escalated the situation. But if we consider the context of past mistreatment, maybe B (not wrong) is possible. Hmm. I need to decide based on the scenario's emphasis on the author's actions leading to the ruined dinner. The family started it, but the author's response was the direct cause. So likely A, but maybe there's nuance. I think the answer here is A because even though the family was at fault, the author's reaction was what caused the argument and the dinner's ruin. So they are in the wrong.\n"
