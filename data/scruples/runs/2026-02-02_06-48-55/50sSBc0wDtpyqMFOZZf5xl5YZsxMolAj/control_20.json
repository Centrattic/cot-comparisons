It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a family dinner where the author's sister and parents started talking about the author's ex in a negative way. The author then interrupted by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, leading to a big argument and the dinner turning tense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of being criticized by the family for their past relationship, which already caused some trauma. When the sister brings up the ex in a negative light, the author feels attacked. The author's response is to flip the script and call out others for having exes as well. \n\nNow, the key points here are about social boundaries. Bringing up exes can be sensitive, especially in a family setting. The author's sister and parents were talking about the author's ex in a critical manner, which the author found unfair. The author's reaction was to turn the tables and include everyone else's exes. \n\nIs the author responsible for the family bringing up their exes? The family started the conversation, so maybe they initiated the sensitive topic. But the author's response was to escalate it by making it a group discussion about everyone's exes. That might have been a defensive move, but it could also be seen as a direct challenge to the family's comments.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 and others stayed quiet, which suggests that the family's comments were perhaps not the norm for the group. The author, feeling attacked, took a stand. However, the way they did it was confrontational in a family setting, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSocially, interrupting a conversation to flip the script can be seen as rude, even if the initial comments were hurtful. The author's response might have been a valid reaction to being criticized, but the method could have been more tactful. The question is whether the author overstepped by making it about everyone else's exes, leading to the dinner's collapse.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were defending themselves against unfair criticism. They feel it's a \"you can serve it but not take it\" situation. However, the family's reaction was that the author was inappropriate. The author's fianc\u00e9 and the sister's boyfriend stayed quiet, which might indicate that the family's remarks were out of line, but the author's response was also disruptive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family started the conversation about exes, which was problematic. The author's reaction was a defensive tactic, but it's possible that the author could have handled it differently without escalating. However, if the family was being unfair, the author's response might be justified as a way to call out the double standard.\n\nSo, the debate is between the family's initial transgression and the author's response. The question is whether the author's action was a reasonable defense or an overreaction. Different people might see it differently. If the family was being unkind and the author was trying to highlight the unfairness, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author's method of response was too harsh for a family dinner, they might be at fault.\n\nI think the key is that the author's response, while perhaps well-intentioned, was an escalation that could have been avoided. However, the family did start the conversation that hurt the author. The author's action might have been a justified reaction to being criticized, but it's possible they could have handled it more gracefully. Depending on cultural or social norms, the answer might vary. In some contexts, calling out the family's behavior in that way is appropriate, in others, it's seen as rude. Given the situation, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they were defending themselves against criticism, but it's a close call.\n"
