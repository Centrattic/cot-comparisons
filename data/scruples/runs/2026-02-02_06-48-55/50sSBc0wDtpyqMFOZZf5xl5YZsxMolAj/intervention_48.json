It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author felt their ex was being criticized by their sister and parents, so they responded by suggesting everyone talk about their exes. This led to an argument and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that their family was bringing up their ex in a negative way, and they wanted to highlight the double standard. They might feel justified in pointing out that others also have exes. However, the response was confrontational and might have escalated the situation. The family's perspective is that they were just having a conversation about past relationships, maybe not intending to hurt the author, but the author's reaction was out of line in a family setting.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of bringing up exes in a dinner setting, the author's reaction, and whether the family's comments were truly harmful. The author's ex was being criticized, which could be hurtful, especially if there's a history of family disapproval. The author's response, while possibly a fair point in theory, was done in a way that could be seen as aggressive or shutting down the conversation. In family gatherings, especially with close relatives, the tone and approach matter. The author might have been reacting to past pain, but the method of addressing it could be seen as inappropriate because it turned the conversation into a confrontation rather than a constructive dialogue.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction of calling the author \"wildly inappropriate\" suggests that the method was not well-received. The author's intention was to equalize the discussion, but the execution might have been too harsh for that context. While the family's comments were hurtful, the solution might have been to address the issue more calmly rather than escalate it. The author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach was likely not the best. Therefore, they could be in the wrong depending on the family dynamics and expectations.\n"
