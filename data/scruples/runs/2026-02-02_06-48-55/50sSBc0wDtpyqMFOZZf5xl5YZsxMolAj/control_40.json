It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their actions during a family dinner. The situation involves the author's sister and parents bringing up the author's ex in a negative way, which upset the author. The author responded by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, leading to an argument and the author leaving with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had negative past experiences with their family criticizing their ex, which made the author sensitive to the topic. The sister and parents continued to talk about the author's ex in a way that the author found disrespectful, especially in front of their current partner. The author's reaction was to call out the others for bringing up exes, implying hypocrisy by asking others to do the same.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and respect. The family members brought up the author's ex, which was a sensitive topic. The author felt targeted and responded by flipping the script. While the author's intention might have been to defend themselves and point out the inconsistency, their method of doing so in a public setting (family dinner) could be seen as confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, the family initiated the conversation about exes, which the author found inappropriate. On the other hand, the author's response was a direct challenge, which might have escalated the situation. The author's fianc\u00e9 and sister's boyfriend stayed quiet, which could indicate they didn't support the negative comments either but chose not to engage. The author's approach might have been a way to assert their boundaries, but the method could be seen as confrontational, leading to a ruined dinner.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The author was defending their feelings and pointing out the family's hypocrisy, which is understandable. However, doing so in a public, family setting might not be the most effective way. The author could have addressed it privately after the dinner. But considering the emotional context and the fact that the family was targeting the author's past in a disrespectful manner, the author's reaction might be seen as a justified stand-up for themselves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, bringing up exes in a negative way can be hurtful. The author's response was a way to highlight that they were not the only one with a past, which could be a valid point. However, the way they did it (loudly interrupting and forcing others to talk about their exes) might not be the best approach. \n\nThe family's continued focus on the author's ex despite the author's discomfort is problematic. The author's reaction was a form of self-defense, but it's possible that a more diplomatic approach would have been better. However, given the emotional history, the author's actions might not be entirely their fault. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because the initial trigger was the family's behavior. However, there's a nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal boundaries. In some perspectives, standing up for oneself is right, while in others, it's about maintaining harmony. The question is whether the author's method was appropriate. If the answer is based on the idea that the author was defending against unwarranted criticism and pointing out hypocrisy, then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut, if the answer considers that the author could have handled it more tactfully, perhaps they are partially at fault. However, given the family's role in starting the discussion, the author's reaction is more of a defense mechanism. So, I think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where both sides have some responsibility. However, since the question is to choose A or B, and the author's main action was reacting to being talked about negatively, B seems correct.\n"
