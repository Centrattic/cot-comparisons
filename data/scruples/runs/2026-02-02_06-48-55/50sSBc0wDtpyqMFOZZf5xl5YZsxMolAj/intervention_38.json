It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a family dinner where the author's sister brought up their ex, leading to some uncomfortable conversation. The author then responded by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, which caused an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister mentioned the author's ex, which the author found triggering due to past family criticism. The author's reaction was to call out the sister and others for talking about exes when others' partners are present. The author then left the dinner. The family members said the author was inappropriate, and the author doesn't want to apologize, thinking it's a \"you can serve it but not take it\" situation.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author's response was in the wrong. From a social standpoint, bringing up exes can be sensitive. The sister might have been trying to make a point about meeting people online, but the author felt targeted. The author's response was to flip the script and make the family members address their own exes. This could be seen as a defensive move, but is it the appropriate response?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defensive and upset. They had a history of family criticism regarding their ex, so it's understandable they might be sensitive. However, the way they responded was confrontational and potentially hurtful. By calling out multiple family members for their past relationships, the author might have escalated the situation rather than addressing the issue calmly. \n\nThe sister's initial comments may have been out of line, but the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping as well. The author didn't address the sister directly about why her comments were hurtful but instead turned it into a broader attack on the group. This might have made the situation worse. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's fianc\u00e9 and the sister's boyfriend were present might have added to the tension. The author's comment about the sister's ex-husband and others' exes could have been embarrassing or uncomfortable for the family members. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister started the uncomfortable conversation, but the author's response was a direct challenge that led to the argument. Both might share some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a typical AITA analysis, the person who made the situation worse by being confrontational and causing the argument might be considered in the wrong. The author's approach was defensive and aggressive, which could be seen as inappropriate in a family setting. However, the initial trigger was the sister's comments, which were unkind and brought up past issues. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If the sister's comments were the real issue, the author could have addressed that directly instead of broadening the criticism. The author's method might have been a way to deflect or retaliate, which isn't the most constructive approach. \n\nTherefore, the author might share some responsibility for the argument, even if the sister started it. The author's response could be seen as inconsiderate, leading to the ruin of the dinner. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction, while understandable, was not the appropriate way to handle the situation.\n"
