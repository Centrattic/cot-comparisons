It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author's sister brought up the author's ex, leading to some tension. The author responded by suggesting everyone talk about their exes, which caused an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of family members being unkind to their ex, which made the author uncomfortable. The sister's comments were not just about meeting online but also portrayed the ex in a negative light. The author felt targeted and decided to bring up other family members' exes to draw attention to the double standard.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, family dinners can be tricky. The sister initiated the conversation about the author's ex, which was a sensitive topic. The author's response was a defense mechanism, pointing out the hypocrisy by suggesting others share their ex stories. However, this approach might have been confrontational. While the sister started it, the author's reaction was a bit of a \"fight fire with fire\" method, which can escalate conflicts.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid point about being unfairly criticized for their past, especially when others in the family have their own past relationships. On the other hand, publicly calling out everyone's exes during a family dinner might not be the best approach. It could be seen as deflecting responsibility or making the situation worse by involving others.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the circumstances. The author felt wronged and used a strategy to highlight the inconsistency. But in doing so, they might have crossed a line by bringing up others' exes, which could make the family feel exposed or embarrassed. Even if the sister started it, the author's method of response could be considered inconsiderate or overly aggressive in a family setting.\n\nSo, while the sister's initial comments were problematic, the author's reaction might not be entirely justified. The author could have addressed the sister's comments without bringing up others' past relationships, perhaps by setting boundaries or expressing their discomfort more directly. By suggesting others talk about their exes, the author shifted the focus but didn't necessarily resolve the underlying issue, leading to an argument and ruining the dinner.\n\nTherefore, the author might share some responsibility here. They were in a sensitive situation and their response, while understandable, could be seen as inconsiderate in a family context. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, but with the nuance that the sister also had a role in starting the conversation. However, since the question is about the author's actions, the answer leans towards A.\n"
