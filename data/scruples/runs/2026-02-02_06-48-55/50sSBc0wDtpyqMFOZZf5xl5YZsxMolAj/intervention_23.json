It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family dinner where the author's sister and parents were discussing the author's ex, which upset the author. The author then called out the family for talking about exes and suggested others do the same, leading to an argument and the author leaving with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of being criticized by their family about their ex, which was a sensitive topic for them. When the sister brought up the ex again, it triggered the author. The author responded by flipping the script and asking everyone else to talk about their exes, which caused tension.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze: Was the author's reaction appropriate? The sister initiated the conversation about the author's ex, which the author found uncomfortable. The author tried to redirect the conversation to others, but that might have come off as confrontational. Family gatherings can be tricky, and sometimes bringing up past relationships can be hurtful, especially if there's a history of criticism.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the family shouldn't criticize others when they themselves have exes. However, by doing this, the author might have overreacted by making it a group confrontation. The family might have felt attacked, leading to the argument. The author left, thinking they weren't in the wrong, but others felt the conversation was ruined because of their response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sensitivity is valid. If the family had a history of being unkind about their ex, it's understandable they'd be upset. However, the method of responding by publicly calling out everyone could be seen as inconsiderate, as it turned a personal issue into a broader conflict. The author's fianc\u00e9 and sister's boyfriend were also present, and the author's outburst might have made them uncomfortable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did have a valid grievance, but their approach might have been inappropriate. The sister initiating the conversation wasn't great, but the author's reaction escalated things. It's possible both sides have some responsibility here. The author's reaction was a direct response to being criticized, but using a confrontational approach might not have been the best choice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if the initial criticism was unfair.\n"
