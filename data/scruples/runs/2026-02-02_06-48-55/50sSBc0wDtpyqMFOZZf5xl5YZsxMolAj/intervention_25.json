It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a family dinner with their fianc\u00e9, sister, sister's boyfriend, and parents. The sister started talking about the author's ex, which made the author uncomfortable because their family had previously been unkind to them and their ex. The author felt that the sister and parents were criticizing their ex unfairly. In response, the author called out the whole group for talking about exes and suggested everyone share their exes, which led to an argument and the author leaving with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The person who posted the question thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me consider the key points here. The author's sister brought up the ex, and the family had a history of being unkind. The author felt targeted and decided to respond by flipping the script and bringing up others' exes. The author's intention was to point out the inconsistency in the family's behavior\u2014why is it okay to talk about the author's ex, but not others'?\n\nBut did the author overreact? Maybe. By loudly suggesting that everyone should talk about their exes, they might have escalated the situation. The family members might not have intended to target the author, but the author's response could be seen as confrontational and inappropriate in a family setting. Family dinners are supposed to be relaxed, and bringing up exes can be a sensitive topic. The author's outburst could have been a way to defend themselves, but it might have been better handled by addressing the sister's comments privately instead of flipping the table in front of everyone.\n\nHowever, the author had valid reasons for being upset. Their past experiences with the family's negativity were still a sore point, and the sister's comments were triggering. The author might have felt that they had to defend their ex and themselves in the moment, but the method might have been too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's actions\u2014bringing up the ex in the first place\u2014might have been the root of the problem. The sister's comments about meeting someone online and implying the author was foolish could have been hurtful. The author's response, while perhaps confrontational, was a defense mechanism.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person acted proportionally and respectfully. The author's response was a direct challenge to the family's behavior, which could be seen as necessary to set boundaries. However, the manner in which they did it might have been inappropriate, causing the argument and ruining the dinner.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think there's a balance here. The author had a right to feel hurt and to defend themselves, but their public confrontation might have been the wrong approach. The sister's initial comments were the catalyst, but the author's reaction escalated the situation. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, but perhaps not entirely. However, since the family's actions were the starting point, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But in terms of the immediate action, the author's outburst led to the argument, so they might be at fault for how they responded.\n"
