It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for ruining a family dinner by suggesting everyone talk about their exes. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's sister brought up the author's ex during dinner, which the author found uncomfortable because the family had previously been unkind about that ex. The author then responded by suggesting that everyone should talk about their exes, including the parents and the sister, which led to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister initiated the conversation about the ex, the author felt targeted, and in response, the author tried to turn the conversation around to others. The author's intention might have been to deflect and point out the hypocrisy of discussing exes when others are present, but the method might have been inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering social norms, bringing up someone's ex can be sensitive, especially if it's done in a way that's critical. The sister's comments about the author's ex being unsafe could be hurtful. However, the author's response was to call out everyone else's exes, which might have been seen as confrontational and disruptive in a family setting. The author's fianc\u00e9 and others were quiet, so maybe they didn't want to escalate things.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're not the one who should apologize because the sister started it, but by responding in a loud and confrontational way, the author did contribute to ruining the dinner. The family's reaction was that the author was inappropriate, which suggests that the method of response was not well-received, even if the underlying issue had validity.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the sister initiated the topic, the author's reaction could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. The author had the option to change the subject or address it privately but chose a public confrontation. That might make the author at least partially at fault for escalating the situation.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to stop the negative discussion about their ex, which is understandable. The line between standing up for oneself and overreacting is thin here. It's possible that the author felt cornered and used a strategy to shift the focus, but the approach was not diplomatic.\n\nIn many cases, such conflicts are seen as shared responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author's response was uncalled for despite the sister's comments. If B (no), it's because the author was defending themselves against an unjust conversation.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the author's reaction, while understandable, was inappropriate in a family dinner setting, and they could have handled it differently without causing a scene. The sister starting the conversation doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for how they responded.\n"
