It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the author's sister and parents were talking negatively about the author's ex. The author felt targeted because of past family criticism and responded by bringing up other family members' exes, leading to an argument and the dinner ending poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of being criticized by their family about their ex, which caused emotional pain. When the sister brings up the ex again, the author feels attacked. Their response was to flip the script by suggesting others talk about their exes, which might be seen as deflecting or being confrontational.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, bringing up past relationships in front of current partners can be awkward. The author's response could be seen as a way to shift the focus and hold family members accountable for their actions. However, doing so in a group setting, especially after others have already criticized them, might come off as aggressive or defensive.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author intended to defend themselves by highlighting the inconsistency in others bringing up exes. However, the impact of their outburst likely caused embarrassment and tension. The family's initial criticism was the trigger, but the author's reaction escalated the situation. \n\nIt's important to note that while the author had valid feelings, the method they used to address them might not have been the most appropriate. A more constructive approach could have been to address the criticism privately or to set boundaries without turning it into a group confrontation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family started the discussion that upset the author. However, the author's response directly led to the argument. So there's a balance here. The initial criticism was problematic, but the author's public rebuttal might have been the direct cause of the dinner's failure. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might share some responsibility for how they handled the situation, even if the family's behavior was the root cause. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but with nuance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their response was defensive but perhaps not the most socially graceful, they might be seen as partially at fault. But if we strictly look at who started the negative comments, the family is more in the wrong. The author's defense, while perhaps not perfect, was a reaction to being attacked. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to weigh the social etiquette here. Publicly calling others out in that way can be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
