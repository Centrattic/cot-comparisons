I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about having loud sex to annoy someone with a crush on the girlfriend. First, I need to break down the key points.\n\nThe author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm. There's a neighbor, J, who has a crush on her. J is of Chinese descent, and D is also Chinese. J thinks dating within their culture would be easier, but D prefers tall white guys. The author met J when they were going to a concert, and J gave D a teddy bear in front of him. The author felt J was persistent and maybe not getting that D isn't interested. So, the author decided to have loud sex with D knowing J was in the adjacent room. The idea was to make J realize he has no chance. However, D felt bad afterward, and J looked angry when they passed each other.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but wants confirmation. Let's consider different angles.\n\nFirst, consent. The author and D were in a relationship, so their sexual activities are consensual. But the issue is using that activity to intentionally embarrass or hurt J. Is that acceptable? Intentionally causing emotional harm to someone else, even if they're a stalker, might cross a line. \n\nAlso, D's feelings were hurt by the author's actions. She was worried about J's feelings and started to get angry at the author for being mean. The author apologized, but the action still affected their relationship. \n\nEthically, is it okay to use someone else's emotional pain for personal satisfaction? The author felt thrilled to \"dunk on this dude,\" which suggests a desire to assert dominance or superiority. That's not a healthy way to handle jealousy or a stalker. \n\nJ's behavior: giving a teddy bear in front of the boyfriend is probably a boundary issue, but the author's response was to retaliate in a way that's invasive and public. The dorm walls are thin, so the noise would carry. The author knew the roommate was out, so they had the opportunity. But is it right to use loud sex as a weapon? \n\nPossible arguments against the author: It's a form of bullying or harassment. Even if J is creepy, the author's method is not appropriate. It could be considered a violation of J's privacy, even if it's a public setting. The author took it upon themselves to punish J without addressing the issue directly, like confronting him or talking to D about setting better boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, J was persistent, and D wasn't forceful in rejecting him. The author might feel justified in trying to deter J, but the method was extreme. The author could have communicated with D more about how to handle J's advances instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author's action caused D to feel sad and conflicted, which could strain their relationship. The author's pride in making J suffer shows a lack of empathy, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were intentional, harmful, and caused emotional distress to both J and D. Even if the motivation was to protect the relationship, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
