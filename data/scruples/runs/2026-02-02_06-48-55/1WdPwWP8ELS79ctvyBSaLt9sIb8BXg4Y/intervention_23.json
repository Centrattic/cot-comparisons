I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having loud sex to annoy someone who has a crush on his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm, and their neighbor J has a crush on her. J is also Asian, and he thinks D should date someone from her culture. The author is white, and D prefers tall white guys. The author met J once, and J gave D a teddy bear in front of them. The author then decided to have loud sex to make J uncomfortable, which D was upset about. The author feels conflicted but also enjoyed \"dunking\" on J, leading to the question of whether he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and their consequences. The author's intention was to make J suffer by being loud during sex, knowing the walls are thin. The main issue here is whether this action crosses a line. \n\nFirst, consider intent. The author wanted to hurt J's feelings by making him hear them. Intentionally causing emotional harm can be a problem, even if not physical. But J's actions towards D might be seen as annoying or inappropriate, which could justify the author's response. However, using loud sex as retaliation might be a bit extreme. \n\nThen there's D's reaction. She was upset after realizing J could hear them, concerned about his feelings. The author dismissed her concern, suggesting that J needed to hear it. This shows a lack of empathy for D's perspective and J's possible feelings. Also, the author seems to have acted without D's full consent or comfort. Even though they had sex before, the loudness was a deliberate choice to target J, which might not have considered D's comfort level. \n\nAnother angle: the building's thin walls and the fact that they were in a dorm. Is it reasonable to expect privacy? Maybe not, but does that justify the action? The author knew the walls were flimsy, so they had prior knowledge that their activities could be heard. However, using that knowledge to purposefully annoy someone is a different matter. It's one thing to be careless and another to be intentional. \n\nAlso, the cultural aspect. J's belief that dating within the same culture is better and the author's frustration with J's resentment towards white guys dating Asian women. This adds a layer of potential cultural sensitivity issues. But the author's reaction doesn't address the cultural issue; instead, it's a personal retaliation. \n\nThe author's own admission of feeling \"thrilled\" to dunk on J suggests a desire to dominate or belittle, which could be seen as petty or mean-spirited. Even if J is annoying, the author's approach might be seen as crossing a line from self-defense to personal satisfaction. \n\nOn the other hand, J's behavior\u2014giving a teddy bear without an introduction, not acknowledging the author, and showing up with the bear\u2014could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate. The author might feel justified in defending his relationship. However, the method of retaliation might not be the most appropriate. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were intended to cause discomfort to J, which is a form of harassment. Even if J is not a nice person, the author's response could be seen as inconsiderate and lacking in empathy. The key here is that the author used a personal and intimate act as a weapon, which might be in the wrong. \n\nD's discomfort after the fact also shows that the action had negative consequences on their relationship, which the author didn't fully consider. The author's dismissive attitude towards her feelings (\"I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear\") indicates a lack of consideration for her perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while J's behavior was problematic, the author's response was an intentional act to embarrass and hurt J, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
