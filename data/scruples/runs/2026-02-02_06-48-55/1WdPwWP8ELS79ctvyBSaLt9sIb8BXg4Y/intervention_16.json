I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for having loud sex to annoy someone with a crush on his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm, and J, a neighbor of the same ethnicity, has a crush on her. D hasn't been clear about rejecting J, leading the author to feel like J isn't getting the message. The author's plan to make J suffer by being loud during sex was intentional, even knowing that J's room is nearby and the walls are thin. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. The author's goal was to make J back off by letting him hear their loud sex. But is that the right approach? Manipulating someone's actions through loud sex could be considered a form of retaliation, which might be unethical. Even if the author's intention was to put J off, using their relationship as a weapon to harm another person's feelings isn't ideal. \n\nAlso, D's reaction is important. She felt sad about J hearing their sex and started worrying about his feelings, which shows she might not have wanted to hurt him. The author's suggestion that J needed to hear it to understand he's not an option seems to have upset her. This could indicate that the author went against her wishes or values, even if he thought he was helping. \n\nThen there's the fact that the author was \"fucking thrilled\" to see J's reaction. That kind of enjoyment in another person's potential distress is a red flag. It suggests a lack of empathy and a desire to dominate, which could be problematic. \n\nEthically, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a line. While it's understandable that he felt threatened by J's persistent crush, the method he used was underhanded. J might have felt embarrassed, but the author took advantage of the situation to humiliate him, even if unintentionally. \n\nMoreover, the cultural aspect mentioned here is a sensitive point. J's belief that dating within their culture is easier is a stereotype, but the author's response to that by using loud sex might not address the underlying issue. D's type is tall, white guys, which she hasn't communicated clearly to J. The author's approach didn't help resolve that; instead, it caused more emotional harm.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his concerns with D first, rather than acting on his own. If they wanted to make it clear to J that they're in a relationship, they should have done so directly, maybe by being more open about their relationship status or having D set clearer boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author had a motive, the method he used was manipulative and potentially hurtful. The fact that he took pleasure in J's discomfort points to being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
