I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy a guy, J, who has a crush on her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his girlfriend, D, have been together for three months. J, a neighbor of D's in a co-ed dorm, has a longstanding crush. Both J and D are of Chinese descent, and J seems to think that should make them a couple. D has a type for tall white guys, and the author is white. The author met J during a concert where J gave D a teddy bear, which might have been a romantic gesture. The author then decided to have loud sex the next night to make J hear and understand that D isn't interested.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's intentional action to make J hear them during sex. D felt sad afterward, thinking it might hurt J, and the author admitted to feeling \"thrilled to dunk on this dude,\" which suggests some satisfaction in making J uncomfortable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the ethical aspects. Intentionally causing someone else discomfort or humiliation, even if they have a crush on your partner, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions were calculated to send a message, not just an accident. While J's behavior might be annoying or inappropriate, the author's response was to use a personal, intimate act to target him. That's usually considered disrespectful and potentially violating J's privacy or dignity.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to spite J, not necessarily to address the situation maturely. The fact that he felt some primal need to \"be king\" indicates an ego-driven reaction. D's reaction is important too\u2014she was worried about J's feelings, which shows the author might not have considered her perspective or the potential for his actions to cause unintended emotional distress. \n\nEven if the walls are flimsy, the author could have been considerate of the neighbors, especially someone like J. The fact that he specifically planned to have loud sex because he knew J was nearby suggests intent to harm, which is a problem. The author didn't communicate his plan with D before the fact, leading to her regret later. So, the action was impulsive and possibly insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, J's persistence with the crush and his cultural argument might be part of the problem. But the author's response still seems extreme. The appropriate action might have been to talk to J, set boundaries, or let D handle it herself. Using loud sex as a form of retaliation isn't a respectful or healthy approach. It could backfire, leading to more tension or even affecting the relationship with D if she feels her privacy was used as a weapon.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
