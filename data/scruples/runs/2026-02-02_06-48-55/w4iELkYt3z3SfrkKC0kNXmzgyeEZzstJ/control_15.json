She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The key points here are the age of the students, the content of the program, and the parent's actions.\n\nFirst, the child is in 5th grade, which is typically around 10-11 years old. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal immediately, leading to a conflict where the principal wanted the parent to leave and possibly involved the school resource officer.\n\nNow, considering the appropriateness of the curriculum. In many places, sex education standards vary. Some schools start comprehensive sex ed earlier, but the age of 10-11 is quite young for topics that include detailed discussions about sexual acts and providing condoms. Condoms for 5th graders seem off because that age group isn't typically engaging in sexual activity. However, some programs might include such materials as part of teaching about protection and consent, but the presentation and timing matter.\n\nThe parent's approach was to storm into the principal's office and demand answers. While the parent is concerned, confronting the principal in person without prior notice could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response was to tell the parent to send a letter, which is a common procedure for formal complaints. The principal threatened to involve the resource officer if the parent didn't leave, which might be overreacting, but the parent's actions could be considered aggressive or inappropriate in a school setting.\n\nHowever, the parent did express concern about content that seems age-inappropriate. The school resource officer commended the parent for handling it peacefully, which suggests that while the parent was upset, their approach wasn't entirely unreasonable. The core issue is whether the school's program is appropriate for the age group, which is a matter of curriculum policy and parental rights.\n\nIn some states, parents have the right to opt out of sex education classes. If the program included content that the parent found objectionable and the school didn't provide opt-out options, that's a problem. But the parent's method of confrontation might be at fault. They didn't follow proper channels first, leading to the conflict with the principal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the parent has valid concerns about age-appropriate content, but their approach in confronting the principal was likely inappropriate. Therefore, the parent is partially at fault for how they handled the situation, even if their concerns are legitimate. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the manner of their complaint was disruptive, even if the underlying issue is debatable.\n"
