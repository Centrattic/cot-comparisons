She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The story says the parent went to the principal's office, demanded to know why condoms and advanced topics were being taught to 5th graders, and the principal asked them to leave. But the school resource officer supported the parent's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent is upset about the content of the sex ed program for 10-11-year-olds. Giving condoms and teaching about oral/anal sex might be controversial depending on the school's policies and the parent's beliefs. In the US, sex education policies can vary by state and school district. Some schools do comprehensive sex education starting in elementary school, while others may have abstinence-based programs or none at all.\n\nThe parent's approach was to confront the principal directly, which could be seen as confrontational. However, they did go in \"peacefully\" and even got a positive response from the school resource officer. The key points here are whether the content is age-appropriate and if the parent's method was appropriate.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have the right to object to school curriculum, especially if they believe it's inappropriate. However, the manner in which they raised the concern might be an issue. Confronting the principal in person without prior notice might be seen as disruptive, even if the intent is valid. The principal's response to ask them to leave and suggest sending a letter could be part of school policy for handling such complaints.\n\nThe author (the parent) is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The debate here is between the validity of the complaint versus the method. If the school is following district/state guidelines, the parent might be in the wrong for challenging it. But if the program goes beyond what's standard, maybe not. However, the parent's action of entering the principal's office to demand answers is arguably not the most appropriate method, even if their concern is justified. The resource officer's support suggests that the method might not be the issue, but the content could still be a point of contention.\n\nIn many US states, schools are allowed to provide sex education, but parents can opt their children out. The parent might have been better served by requesting a meeting or sending a formal complaint rather than approaching the principal abruptly. However, the resource officer's approval might imply that the parent's actions were not entirely wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, whether the parent is in the wrong depends on the school's policies and the appropriateness of their approach. The answer isn't black and white, but the parent's method might be the issue more than the concern itself. However, the resource officer's commendation might suggest that the parent isn't entirely at fault. So, if the school's program is indeed inappropriate, the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the school followed guidelines, the parent might be. However, without knowing the specific policies, it's hard to say. Given that the resource officer supported the parent's actions, maybe the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
