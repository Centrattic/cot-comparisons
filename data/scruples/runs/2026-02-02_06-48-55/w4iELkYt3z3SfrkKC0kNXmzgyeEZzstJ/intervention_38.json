She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office without notice, demanded answers, and was told to leave, which escalated to a threat of police involvement. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the US, sex education standards vary by state and district. Some states require age-appropriate sex education, which might include topics like puberty, consent, and basic anatomy. Condoms might be discussed in the context of protection, but giving out actual condoms to 10-11-year-olds seems questionable. However, the parent's approach is also under scrutiny.\n\nThe parent's method of addressing their concerns was confrontational. Walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding immediate answers without following proper channels (like scheduling a meeting or sending a letter) might be seen as disruptive. The principal's response, while firm, could be their way of handling unexpected confrontations. The school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene but commended the parent's calmness adds a layer of complexity. It suggests that while the parent's feelings are valid, their approach was not the most effective.\n\nNow, considering if the parent is in the wrong. The issue here is not just about the content of the sex ed program but also the manner in which the parent addressed it. Even if the parent believes the content is inappropriate, the method of confrontation might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The correct approach would involve following school protocols, perhaps discussing with the teacher first, then escalating if needed. So, even if the parent has valid concerns, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate of school procedures and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's shock and concern might be justified if the curriculum indeed included topics that are too advanced for the age group. The school's provision of condoms to 5th graders is a red flag, as it's unlikely to be standard for that age. However, the parent's actions\u2014storming into the principal's office and causing a scene\u2014might be where they went wrong, regardless of their intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach might be seen as inconsiderate and disruptive, even if their concerns about the curriculum are valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, not necessarily the content of their complaint.\n"
