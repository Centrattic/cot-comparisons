She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The key points here are the age of the children (10-11 years old), the content taught (like oral and anal sex), and the distribution of condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the curriculum. In the US, sex education varies by state and district. Some places have comprehensive sex education that starts at younger ages, while others have more restrictive policies. However, teaching topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11 year olds is questionable because that's typically beyond their developmental stage. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations do recommend age-appropriate sex education, but the timing and content matter. At 5th grade, it's more common to cover body parts, consent, and puberty basics. Advanced topics might be introduced later, but not at this age.\n\nThen there's the issue of distributing condoms to 5th graders. That seems inappropriate. Condoms are usually provided in older grades where students might be more likely to engage in sexual activity. However, even then, it's a controversial topic. Providing them to such young children could be seen as promoting or normalizing sexual activity before they're developmentally ready.\n\nThe parent's reaction is to confront the principal in person. While this is a direct approach, walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding answers might be seen as confrontational. Schools often prefer communication through proper channels, like written complaints or meetings arranged beforehand. The principal's threat to involve the school resource officer suggests that the parent's approach was perceived as disruptive, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n\nHowever, the parent did express their concern and was advised to send a letter. The school resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent for being peaceful indicates that the parent's intent was to raise a valid concern, even if the method was abrupt.\n\nIn terms of legal or educational guidelines, the school might have a policy that includes comprehensive sex education, but if it's violating state laws or the parent's rights, the parent has a case. The school should provide information about their curriculum and allow parents to opt out if possible, depending on local regulations.\n\nSo, putting this together: The parent's concern about the content and materials is valid given the age. The method of confronting the principal might be seen as hasty, but the core issue is the school's curriculum. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for voicing their concern, especially since the school's response was to threaten removal instead of addressing the concerns. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent's main issue is the inappropriate content, not their method, which, while direct, was a reaction to a problematic situation.\n"
