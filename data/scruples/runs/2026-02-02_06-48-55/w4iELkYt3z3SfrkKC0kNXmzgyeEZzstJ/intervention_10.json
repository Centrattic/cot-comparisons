She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the parent is upset that their 5th-grade daughter received condoms and was taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office in person, demanded an explanation, and was told to leave. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer, but the officer actually commended the parent for being peaceful.\n\nThe parent is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides here.\n\nIn the U.S., sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, which includes information about various types of sexual activity and contraception. If the school's program is in line with local regulations, then maybe the parent's complaint is out of line. However, the parent's concern about age-appropriate content is valid. Teaching 10-11-year-olds about advanced sexual topics might be considered inappropriate by some, even if the school follows guidelines.\n\nThe parent's approach is aggressive. Storming into the principal's office and demanding answers in a confrontational manner is not the usual way to handle a complaint. The principal's response was to send them away and suggest a formal letter instead. The parent's actions could be seen as disruptive, even if their concerns are legitimate. However, the school resource officer's response suggests that some might see the parent's frustration as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent has a right to be concerned about their child's education and the content their child is exposed to. If the program is age-inappropriate, the parent is within their rights to voice their concerns. The issue is how they did it. The appropriate method would be to follow the school's protocol for voicing concerns, perhaps through a written letter or a meeting arranged properly, rather than an in-person confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the content and the method of the parent's complaint. If the school's program is indeed age-appropriate according to local standards, the parent might be overreacting. However, if the content is too advanced, the parent's concern is valid. The parent's approach, though, was confrontational and not following proper channels, which could make them at fault for the disruptive behavior.\n\nBut the resource officer's comment supports the parent's frustration, indicating that maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong in feeling upset. However, the method of addressing the issue is where the parent went wrong. So, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong because of their approach, not the content of the program.\n"
