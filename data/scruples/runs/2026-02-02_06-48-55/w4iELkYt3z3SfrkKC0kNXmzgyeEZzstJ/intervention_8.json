She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program in their child's 5th grade class. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded to know why condoms and advanced topics were being taught to 10-11 year olds. The principal asked them to leave and threatened involving the school resource officer. The parent then spoke with the officer, who seemed to agree with their frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The parent is upset because they believe the content is age-inappropriate. They might feel that the school is overstepping by introducing topics like oral and anal sex, and giving condoms, which they see as inappropriate for a 5th grader. Their approach was confrontational, entering the principal's office without an appointment and making demands, which led to a threat of removal.\n\nOn the other hand, schools often have curricula approved by educational authorities. Sex education is a common part of health curriculum, aiming to provide accurate information. The school might have followed guidelines, and the principal might have felt the parent was disruptive. The principal's response could be about maintaining order and following procedures, directing the parent to formal channels like sending a letter. The school resource officer's comment might suggest that while he understands the parent's anger, he still expects the parent to follow proper procedures.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the parent wrong for their actions? The parent's concern about appropriate content might be valid, depending on local laws and school policies. However, their method of addressing it\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers without following proper procedures\u2014is problematic. Confrontational behavior in school settings can disrupt the environment and set a poor example for children. The principal's response, while perhaps heavy-handed, is about enforcing procedures. The parent's right to request curriculum changes or opt-out might exist, but the method of protest is where they might be in the wrong.\n\nI should also consider cultural and legal aspects. In some states, parents have the right to opt out of certain sex education topics. However, how they express their objection matters. The parent's actions could be seen as aggressive and not in line with how to properly challenge a school's curriculum. The principal's threat to involve the resource officer might be excessive, but the parent's approach likely escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, while the parent's concern might be understandable, their method of addressing it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
