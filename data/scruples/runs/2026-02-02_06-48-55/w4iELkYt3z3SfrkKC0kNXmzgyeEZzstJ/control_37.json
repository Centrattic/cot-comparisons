She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is a parent who went to the school and complained about the sex education program because their 5th grader (age 10-11) was given a condom and taught about advanced topics like oral and anal sex. The principal told them to leave and mentioned the school resource officer. The resource officer actually agreed with the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the curriculum. In the US, sex education varies by state and school district. Some states require comprehensive sex education, while others leave it up to schools. The parent's concern is that the topics are age-inappropriate for 10-11-year-olds. Condom distribution and teaching about anal/oral sex might be part of a comprehensive program, but some parents might find it too advanced.\n\nThen there's the parent's reaction. They walked into the principal's office and demanded answers. The principal threatened to call the school resource officer, which is a security measure. The parent's actions could be seen as confrontational, but they were trying to voice a legitimate concern about their child's education. The resource officer's comment suggests that the parent's frustration was understood.\n\nLegal aspects: In the US, schools can require parents to opt their children out of sex education if they don't want them to participate. But if the school is following state guidelines, the parent might not have a legal case. However, the parent's approach in confronting the principal might have been unprofessional, leading to the principal's response.\n\nAlso, the parent's immediate reaction without prior communication (like sending a letter) could be problematic. The principal's instruction to send a letter is a standard procedure to handle formal complaints. The parent bypassed that step, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nSo, the parent's actions might not be in the wrong regarding the content of the curriculum if they genuinely believe it's inappropriate. However, their method of addressing it\u2014storming the principal's office and not following the proper channels\u2014could be seen as the issue. The school's response, while firm, is within their policies. The school resource officer's support for the parent's frustration doesn't necessarily mean the parent was right, but it shows that their concern was valid in some way.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent might be in the wrong for their approach rather than the content of the curriculum. The answer could be A (the parent is in the wrong) because of the manner in which they confronted the school, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting their child. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the school followed procedures and the parent skipped steps, A might be the answer.\n"
