She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent went to the principal's office, demanded an explanation, and was told to leave. The school resource officer supported the parent's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children here. Fifth graders in the US are typically 10-11 years old. The parent is upset because their child was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. That does seem very young for such information. \n\nNext, the parent's approach: they went directly to the principal's office and demanded answers. The principal told them to leave and threatened involving the school resource officer. However, the resource officer actually commended the parent for being peaceful. So there's conflicting reactions from the school staff.\n\nI should check if the curriculum aligns with educational standards. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some states mandate age-appropriate sex education, while others have opt-out provisions. The parent's concern about age-appropriateness is valid. Teaching 5th graders about condoms and advanced topics might be beyond their developmental level. \n\nHowever, the parent's method of confrontation could be problematic. Storming into the principal's office and demanding answers without prior communication might not be the most effective approach. It could be seen as aggressive, even if their intentions are good. The principal's response was to have them leave, but the resource officer supported their frustration, indicating that the school might have room for improvement in handling complaints.\n\nThe parent's actions might be justified in terms of their concern for their child's well-being, but the manner in which they addressed the issue could be seen as lacking proper channels. It's possible that the parent should have first reviewed the curriculum materials, opted their child out if necessary, and then communicated with the school in a more structured way.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's a balance between their valid concerns and the method of addressing them. If the school's program is indeed providing age-inappropriate content, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for objecting. However, the way they approached the school (without prior discussion) might be seen as confrontational. \n\nBut considering the resource officer's support, maybe the school's handling of the situation is part of the issue. The parent's right to object to their child's education is protected, but the method of objection could be improved. So, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better conflict resolution strategies.\n"
