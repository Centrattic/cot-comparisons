She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program in their child's school. The parent walked into the principal's office without notice and demanded answers, leading to a confrontation. The school's response was to ask them to leave and threaten involving the resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content being taught. In the US, comprehensive sex education can include topics like puberty, consent, and sometimes condoms, depending on the curriculum. However, teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex might be considered more advanced than typical for that age. But schools often have their curriculum based on state guidelines and age-appropriate standards.\n\nNext, the parent's method of protest. Storming into the principal's office and demanding immediate answers isn't a constructive approach. It's aggressive and could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response to ask them to leave and suggest a formal letter is about maintaining order and proper channels. The parent's actions might be seen as violating school protocol.\n\nThe principal's reaction, including threatening to call the resource officer, is a bit concerning. Schools should handle parent concerns respectfully, even if the parent is upset. However, the parent's approach might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent's calmness is a bit confusing. It suggests that the officer might not support the school's response, but it doesn't negate the parent's responsibility to follow appropriate procedures.\n\nSo, the parent's issue is about content, which might be debatable, but their method of addressing it was inappropriate. It's important to use established communication channels rather than confrontational tactics. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their concerns have some validity.\n"
