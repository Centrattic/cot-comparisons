She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent found out their 5th-grade daughter received condoms and learned about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, was told to leave, and the principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer. The principal later commended the parent's calmness, but the parent is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some schools provide comprehensive sex education starting at younger ages, while others might not. However, giving condoms to 5th graders (typically 10-11 years old) might be controversial. The parent's reaction is strong, but is it justified?\n\nThe parent's actions: They stormed into the principal's office and demanded an explanation. The principal responded by asking them to leave and threatening the resource officer. The parent then talked to the resource officer, who supported their frustration. \n\nNow, considering whether the parent is in the wrong. Arguably, approaching the school to voice concerns is a valid step, but doing so in a confrontational manner without prior communication could be seen as aggressive. However, the principal's response was also harsh. The parent's main issue is the content of the sex ed program, which might be age-appropriate in some contexts but not in others. \n\nBut the key here is whether the parent acted in the wrong. If the school's program is aligned with local guidelines, the parent might be overreacting. However, if the program is indeed providing inappropriate materials for that age group, then the parent has a legitimate concern. \n\nThe parent's method of addressing the issue\u2014storming into the office and demanding answers\u2014might not be the best approach. A more constructive way would be to request a meeting or follow the proper channels. However, the principal's response (threatening to involve the resource officer) seems excessive. \n\nIn terms of the content, if the school is teaching about oral and anal sex to 5th graders, that's likely inappropriate. Most comprehensive sex ed programs for that age focus on basics like puberty, consent, and maybe basic anatomy. Advanced topics come later. So the parent's complaint seems valid in terms of content, but their delivery was confrontational.\n\nSo, the parent might be in the right regarding the content but in the wrong in their approach. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong overall. Since the parent's main issue is the content, which could be inappropriate, but their method was confrontational, it's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the principal's response was also questionable, the parent's actions might be seen as justified in their concern, even if the approach could have been better. \n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the school's curriculum is indeed providing inappropriate materials, then the parent isn't in the wrong for voicing their concerns. However, how they voiced it might be a different issue. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" overall. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (No), the parent is not in the wrong. The content might be inappropriate, and their method, while confrontational, was a reaction to what they perceived as a serious issue. Plus, the principal's response was harsh. So the parent isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
