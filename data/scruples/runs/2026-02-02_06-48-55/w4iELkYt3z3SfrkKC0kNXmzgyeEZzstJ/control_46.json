She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained about their 5th grader's sex education program is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent being upset that their child was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex. They went to the principal's office, got threatened with the school resource officer, and then the SRO actually commended them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's actions. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some schools do include comprehensive sex education that covers topics like puberty, consent, and safe sex practices. But teaching detailed methods of sexual acts to 10-11 year olds might be controversial. Condom distribution could be part of teaching about contraception, but again, the age might be a point of contention.\n\nThen there's the parent's reaction. They confronted the principal in person, which might be seen as aggressive. However, the principal threatened to call the school resource officer, which could escalate things. The SRO's response was supportive, which suggests that maybe the parent had a valid concern and the principal overreacted.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, if the school's curriculum is following local guidelines and laws, the parent might be overstepping by not following proper channels first. But if the school is indeed providing age-inappropriate material, the parent's concern is valid. Also, the parent's approach was confrontational, which might not be the best method, but that doesn't mean they're entirely wrong. The question is whether they're in the wrong for the content or their method.\n\nIn terms of the content, if the school is providing accurate, age-appropriate education, the parent is wrong. But if the school is going beyond what's appropriate, the parent isn't wrong. The SRO's support for the parent's reaction might indicate that the school's actions were questionable. However, the parent didn't follow the proper process (like sending a letter first, as the principal suggested) which could mean they're in the wrong for the approach, even if the content was an issue.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The answer might hinge on whether the education was appropriate and how the parent handled it. If the parent's method was wrong, but the content was okay, then answer A. If both content and method are wrong, A. If content is wrong, answer B. Since the SRO supported the parent, maybe the content was indeed problematic. But the parent's method was confrontational. But in the US, parents have the right to object to curriculum. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong for the content, even if their method could be improved.\n"
