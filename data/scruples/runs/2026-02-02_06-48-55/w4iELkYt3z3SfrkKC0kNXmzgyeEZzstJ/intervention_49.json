She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office without notice and demanded an explanation, leading to a threat of involving the school resource officer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. In the US, schools often have sex education programs, but the age at which certain topics are covered can vary. Condom distribution and teaching about oral/anal sex to 10-11-year-olds might be controversial. However, the parent's method of addressing the issue is important here.\n\nThe parent chose to confront the principal in person without prior notice, which could be seen as confrontational. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and send a formal complaint. While the parent might feel justified in their concern, the immediate confrontation and public demand for answers could be seen as inappropriate. The parent's actions might have disrupted the school environment and escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nHowever, the parent's intentions might be to protect their child, and they might not be aware of the school's policies or the content of the curriculum. The school resource officer's comment suggests that he understood the parent's frustration, indicating that the parent's concerns aren't entirely unfounded. But the method of addressing the issue is key here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's actions were confrontational and not handled through established channels (like a formal letter or meeting). Schools typically have procedures for parents to follow when voicing concerns. The parent's approach could have been more constructive. So, while the concerns might be valid, the way they were addressed could be considered in the wrong.\n"
