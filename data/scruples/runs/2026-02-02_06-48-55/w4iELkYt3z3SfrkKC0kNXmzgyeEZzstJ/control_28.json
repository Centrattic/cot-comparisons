She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The situation is that the author's 5th-grade daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The author confronted the principal, who asked them to leave, but the school resource officer agreed with the author's concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational standards in the US. Sex education policies vary by state and district. Some places have comprehensive sex ed starting early, while others are more abstinence-based or delayed. The parent's right to object to their child's education is a factor here. In some states, parents can opt their children out of sex education classes.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers\u2014might be seen as confrontational. Schools often have procedures for parent concerns, like sending a letter or meeting through formal channels. The principal's response was to have the parent leave, which might be because of the manner of the confrontation rather than the content of the complaint. However, the school resource officer's support suggests that the issue has some validity in the eyes of someone else in the school.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Is the content of the sex ed program appropriate for 5th graders? 2) Did the parent follow the correct procedure for voicing concerns? 3) What are the school's policies and state laws regarding sex education?\n\nIf the school's program is in line with state guidelines, the parent might have a hard time legally challenging it, but they still have the right to object. The parent's method of confrontation might not be the most effective, but their concern isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might depend on whether the content is indeed age-appropriate according to the school's policies and local laws. Since the school resource officer commended the parent, it's possible that the school's approach is questionable. So the parent isn't in the wrong, but their approach could be improved.\n"
