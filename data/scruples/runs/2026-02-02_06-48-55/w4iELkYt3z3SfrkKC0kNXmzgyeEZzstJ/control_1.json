She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The question is about whether giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral and anal sex is appropriate. The parent went to the school and complained, even confronted the principal, and the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade in the US is typically around 10-11 years old. At that age, are these topics age-appropriate? Some people believe that comprehensive sex education should start earlier, but others think it's too young for such detailed information. The curriculum's content is a key point here. If the school is following a standard sex education program that includes distributing condoms, that might align with some educational guidelines, but it's possible that what's being taught isn't age-appropriate. For example, teaching about different types of sexual activities might be more suitable for older students, not 10-year-olds.\n\nThe parent's reaction is another aspect. They went to the school directly, which might not be the correct procedure. Schools usually have policies about parent concerns, like contacting a teacher first or using formal complaint procedures. The parent's approach was confrontational, walking into the principal's office and demanding explanations. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and suggest sending a letter, which is a formal process. However, the parent did approach the school resource officer, who commended their peacefulness, which suggests that their actions, while direct, weren't aggressive.\n\nLegal and educational standards vary by location. In some places, schools are required to provide health education, including sex education, as part of the curriculum. If the program is approved by the school district and follows state guidelines, the school might be within their rights. However, the specific content given to 5th graders, like condoms and advanced topics, could be contentious.\n\nThe parent's decision to complain is their right as a guardian. However, the method of confrontation might have been inappropriate. Instead of confronting the principal immediately, they might have followed the proper channels first. The principal's threat to involve the resource officer could be about maintaining order during a parent's visit, but the resource officer's response indicates that the parent's actions were seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might not be entirely wrong in voicing their concern, especially if they believe the curriculum is inappropriate. However, their approach might have been too direct. The school's responsibility to provide education as per guidelines versus the parent's right to object is a balance. If the school's program is legally sound, the parent's complaint is valid but their method could be improved. But whether they're in the wrong depends on the specific policies and the appropriateness of the content. The key issue here is the content's suitability for the age group, which is debatable. The parent's action in complaining isn't necessarily wrong, but their method could be questioned. However, the school's response of threatening removal might be overreacting. In the end, since the parent is raising a legitimate concern about age-appropriate education, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
