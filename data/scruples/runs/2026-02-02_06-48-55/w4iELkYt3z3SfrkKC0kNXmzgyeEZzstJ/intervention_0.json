      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader being given condoms and taught about oral and anal sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent found out their 10-11 year old daughter received a condom in a sex ed class and was taught about advanced topics. They confronted the principal in person, got told to leave, and then talked to the school resource officer who seemed to agree with them. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset.\n\nNow, what's age-appropriate for sex education? In the US, there's a range of approaches. Some schools start comprehensive sex ed earlier, covering topics like consent and puberty, while others are more abstinence-focused. But teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex seems extreme. Typically, that kind of detailed information is more common in older grades, like middle or high school. Condoms are usually part of discussions about protection during sexual activity, which might be introduced when talking about teen pregnancy, but giving condoms to 10-year-olds is definitely controversial.\n\nThe parent's reaction: They went to the principal's office and demanded answers. Confronting a school in person about a concern is a valid approach, but maybe the manner was abrupt. However, the principal responded by threatening to involve the police, which is a problem. The school resource officer, who might be a police officer, commended the parent for staying calm, suggesting that the principal's reaction was excessive.\n\nLegally and ethically, the school's curriculum might be following district policies, but if the content is age-inappropriate, the parent has a right to question it. The parent's main issue is the content and materials used, not the act of raising a concern. The principal's immediate dismissal and threat could indicate a lack of openness to parent feedback, which is unprofessional.\n\nSo, the parent is justified in their concern about the content being age-inappropriate. They have the right to advocate for their child's education. While their approach might have been direct, the principal's response was unprofessional. The school resource officer's support of the parent suggests that the parent's concern was valid and their manner was reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were a reasonable response to a situation they found inappropriate. The school's reaction was more problematic. So the answer should be B.\n"
