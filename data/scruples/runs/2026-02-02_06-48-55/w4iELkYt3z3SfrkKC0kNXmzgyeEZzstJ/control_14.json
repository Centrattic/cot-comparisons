She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who complained about their 5th grader's sex education program is in the wrong. The answer needs to be A or B. Alright, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe parent went to the school, confronted the principal, and was told to leave. The principal even mentioned involving the police. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who seemed to agree with them. The key points here are the content of the education and the parent's reaction.\n\nNow, I should consider the age of the kids. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old. The parent is upset because they received condoms and were taught about topics like oral and anal sex. That seems quite advanced for that age. In the US, sex education varies by state, but generally, there are guidelines about age-appropriate content. For example, comprehensive sex ed usually starts in middle school, maybe 6th grade and up. Teaching 5th graders about condoms and such specific topics might be beyond what's appropriate.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach is another aspect. They walked into the principal's office and demanded an explanation, leading to being asked to leave. The principal threatened to call security. The parent's method of confronting the issue was direct and possibly confrontational. Schools might prefer parents to follow established procedures, like contacting the teacher first or using formal channels. But the parent's action might be seen as a reasonable expression of concern, especially given the content they found inappropriate.\n\nThe school resource officer's reaction is also a point. He commended the parent for remaining calm despite agreeing that he would have made a bigger scene. This suggests that the officer might see the parent's concerns as valid, even if their method was direct.\n\nIn terms of legal or policy issues, some states require sex education to be age-appropriate and include parent notification. If the school didn't follow these guidelines, the parent has a right to object. However, the parent's approach could be seen as disruptive if they didn't follow the proper procedure. But given the content of the curriculum, the parent's objection is understandable.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the school provided inappropriate content, the parent isn't wrong to protest. However, their method of confrontation might be seen as the wrong approach. But since the resource officer supported their sentiment, maybe the issue is more about the curriculum than the parent's actions. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong for complaining, especially if the school's program was indeed inappropriate for 5th graders. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
