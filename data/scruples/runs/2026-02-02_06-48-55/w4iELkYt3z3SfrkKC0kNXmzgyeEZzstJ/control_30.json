She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for complaining about the school's sex ed program. The parent found out their 5th grader was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. They confronted the principal, who told them to leave and threatened involving the police. The school resource officer commended the parent for not making a bigger scene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. In the US, sex education varies by state and district. Some areas have comprehensive sex ed that includes topics like consent, anatomy, and protection methods. However, giving condoms to 10-11 year olds might be unusual. But the key here is whether the parent's actions were appropriate.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational by going to the principal's office unannounced and demanding answers. This might not be the best method. However, the parent is within their rights to express concerns about their child's education. The principal's response of threatening to involve the resource officer could be seen as excessive, especially if the parent is merely voicing a legitimate concern.\n\nThe resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the parent's approach, while direct, was not unreasonable. The parent is acting in what they believe is their child's best interest. The school's reaction might indicate a lack of proper channels for parental input or a defensive stance.\n\nSo, while the parent could have used a more formal or less confrontational approach, they are not in the wrong for expressing their concerns. The school's handling of the situation (threats, not engaging in dialogue) might be the more problematic part. Therefore, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
