She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grade child's sex education program. The situation involves the parent being upset that their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex at age 10-11.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded answers, leading to a confrontation where the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the resource officer, who seemed to sympathize. The parent is asking if it's normal to give condoms and teach such topics to 5th graders in the US.\n\nNow, in the US, sex education policies can vary by state and school district. Some schools implement comprehensive sex education which includes information about consent, anatomy, and protection methods, while others follow abstinence-only programs. However, teaching about specific sexual acts like oral and anal sex to 10-year-olds might be considered too advanced. The provision of condoms in a school setting, especially at that age, could also be controversial depending on local norms and policies.\n\nThe parent's approach, though, is another aspect. Confronting the principal in person without prior communication and causing a scene could be seen as inappropriate. Schools usually have procedures for parents to voice concerns, like contacting the principal via phone or email, or writing a formal letter. The parent's immediate reaction\u2014storming into the office and demanding explanations\u2014might not align with the established protocols, leading to the principal's defensive response.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern about the content of the sex ed program is valid if they believe it's age-inappropriate. The school resource officer agreeing that they would have been upset and commending the parent for keeping calm suggests that there's some support for the parent's perspective. This complicates the situation because the content being taught might actually be an issue worth addressing, even if the method of complaint was confrontational.\n\nSo, the parent is in a tricky spot. On one hand, they have legitimate concerns about the curriculum and materials used. On the other hand, their approach might have been inappropriate, leading to a hostile reaction from the principal. The key factors here are the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's method of addressing the issue. If the school's program does include topics that are beyond the recommended age, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. However, their manner of complaining might have contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the parent could be partially at fault for their approach, even if their concerns are valid. This makes the answer nuanced, but since the question is a binary choice, the main issue is whether the parent is \"in the wrong.\" If the school's actions were inappropriate, then the parent isn't wrong for objecting. If the school's program was appropriate, then the parent's reaction is the issue. However, given the information that the resource officer commended the parent, it's possible that the school's approach is questionable. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but their method of complaint could be part of the problem. But in terms of the content of the program, if it's indeed age-inappropriate, the parent is justified in their complaint. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their concerns could be valid, even if their approach was rushed. However, some might argue that the parent should have followed proper channels first. But given the resource officer's support, maybe the parent's concerns are valid, making the answer B.\n"
