She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded answers, leading to conflict. The school gave condoms to 5th graders and taught topics like oral and anal sex. The parent is upset and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade in the US is around 10-11 years old. Is the content appropriate? The parent mentioned topics like oral and anal sex, which are pretty advanced for that age group. Schools often have policies on sex education, sometimes following state guidelines. But if the parent feels it's inappropriate, they have the right to voice concerns.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational\u2014walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. That might not be the best way to handle it. Typically, starting with a letter or contacting the school through proper channels is recommended. However, the principal's response was to threaten involving the school resource officer, which seems harsh. The school resource officer actually supported the parent, saying he would have made a scene too. \n\nSo, the parent has valid concerns about age-appropriate material. The school's handling of the parent's complaint was aggressive. The parent's actions were direct but not necessarily wrong if they felt the school was violating policies. However, the method of confrontation might be seen as inconsiderate. It's a balance between the parent's rights and the school's procedures. The parent might not be entirely wrong, especially if the school's program was indeed inappropriate. But the way they approached the school could be criticized for being abrupt. The school's response was also problematic, possibly escalating the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIn the end, the parent might be justified in their complaint, but their approach could have been more diplomatic. However, the school's response was also questionable. So, is the parent in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the school's program was inappropriate, then the parent isn't wrong for objecting. But if the school's program is within policy, then maybe the parent overreacted. But given the age and the topics mentioned, it's possible the school went beyond appropriate education. The parent's right to voice concerns is protected, but the manner might be an issue. The answer might hinge on the school's policies and whether they followed them. If the school didn't follow guidelines, the parent is right. If they did, then the parent's approach is the issue. But without knowing the specific curriculum, it's hard to say. However, given that the SRO supported the parent, maybe the school's actions were questionable. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
