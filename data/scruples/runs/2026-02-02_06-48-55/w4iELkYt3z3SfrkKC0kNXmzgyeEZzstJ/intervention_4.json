She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a parent is upset about their 5th-grade child being given condoms and taught about oral and anal sex in a school sex ed program. The parent went to the principal's office in person and demanded answers, and the principal told them to leave and send a letter instead. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who commended them for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that the content is age-inappropriate. 5th grade is around 10-11 years old, so teaching about condoms and more advanced topics could be seen as too mature for that age. The parent is within their rights to voice concerns, but the way they approached it\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding an explanation\u2014might be considered confrontational.\n\nNow, the school's response. The principal might have policies in place regarding parent complaints, such as requiring written communication to handle issues formally. The principal's threat to involve the school resource officer could be a security measure, even if it's done in a tense situation. However, threatening to call an officer might be seen as excessive, depending on the school's policies and how the parent's actions were perceived.\n\nThe parent's actions: entering the principal's office without an appointment, demanding immediate answers, and being confrontational. While the parent's concerns are valid, the method of addressing them might not be appropriate. Schools often have procedures for parent grievances, and bypassing those could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. However, the parent did not escalate to violence or disruption beyond expressing their frustration.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the parent's behavior wasn't threatening, but the principal's response might be strict on protocol. The key here is whether the parent violated any school policies by not following the proper channels first.\n\nIn terms of the content itself, the appropriateness of the curriculum is a separate issue. Some people might argue that comprehensive sex education includes these topics, while others find it too advanced for 10-year-olds. The parent's right to voice their opinion is protected, but the manner of doing so is under question.\n\nSo, the parent's mistake might be approaching the principal in person without following the established procedure, leading to a confrontation. The principal's response, while possibly rigid, might be enforcing school policy. The parent could have submitted a formal complaint first or requested a meeting, which might have avoided the immediate conflict. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not following the proper process, even if their concerns are legitimate.\n"
