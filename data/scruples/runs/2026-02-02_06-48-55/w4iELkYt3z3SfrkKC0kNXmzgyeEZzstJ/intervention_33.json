She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining to the school about the sex education program provided to their 5th-grade daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parent walked into the principal's office without prior notice and demanded an explanation. The principal asked them to leave and suggested sending a letter instead, which the parent didn't do. The parent mentions topics like oral and anal sex and giving condoms to 10-11-year-olds, which seems concerning. However, I should also think about what's standard in sex education programs. In many places, comprehensive sex ed does cover a range of topics, but the appropriateness of the age and the method of delivery might vary.\n\nNow, the parent's approach: confronting the principal in person and demanding immediate answers might not be the most appropriate way to address concerns. Schools usually have procedures for such matters. The parent's actions could be seen as disruptive, especially since the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. However, the parent might feel strongly about the content and delivery of the program, which is a valid concern for many parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the school resource officer's response, where he commended the parent for keeping calm, suggests that the parent's approach, while confrontational, was not entirely unreasonable. The parent is advocating for their child's education, which is a parent's right.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, if the school followed their own procedures (like allowing parents to opt their children out, providing information in advance), then the parent's reaction might be overstepping. However, if the school didn't communicate the content properly or violated policies regarding the age-appropriate curriculum, the parent has a valid reason to complain. \n\nThe key points are: Did the parent use the correct channels? The parent didn't send a letter first as the principal suggested, which might be against school protocol. Confronting the principal in person could be seen as inappropriate. However, the content of the program itself is questionable. If the school provided age-inappropriate material, the parent is justified in their complaint. But the method of addressing it might be flawed.\n\nSo, the parent is partially at fault for not following the correct complaint procedures. However, the core issue about the curriculum's content is something that warrants discussion. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering both the method and the content, I think the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't follow proper channels, even if their concern is valid. However, others might argue that the school is in the wrong for the content. But according to the question's framing, the parent's actions are the focus. So, the answer would be A.\n"
