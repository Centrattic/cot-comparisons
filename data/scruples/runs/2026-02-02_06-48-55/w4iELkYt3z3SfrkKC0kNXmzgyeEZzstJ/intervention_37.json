She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The situation involves a 5th grader (ages 10-11) being given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age-appropriateness of the content. In the U.S., sex education varies by state and school district. Some schools start comprehensive sex ed earlier, but teaching advanced topics like condom use and specific sexual acts to 10-11-year-olds might be controversial. However, some programs do include basic information on anatomy and contraception, even at younger ages, to promote health education.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction: walking into the principal's office and demanding explanations. While the parent is upset, their approach was confrontational. The principal's response to ask for a letter instead of immediate discussion might be part of the school's protocol for handling complaints. The parent's insistence on immediate confrontation could be seen as disruptive, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene but commended the parent's calmness is interesting. It suggests that while the parent's concerns are shared by some, the method of addressing them might not be the typical approach. However, the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping if they entered the office without an appointment, disrupting school activities.\n\nLegally, schools often have policies on how to handle complaints. Parents do have the right to complain, but they're also expected to follow the school's procedures. By not following the proper channels (like sending a letter first), the parent might have violated school protocols, which could be considered in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, the parent's shock is understandable. However, the method of addressing the issue\u2014confronting the principal directly without prior communication\u2014might not be the most effective or appropriate. Schools usually handle such matters through structured processes to ensure all voices are heard respectfully.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's concerns about the curriculum's content are valid and worth discussing, their approach in confronting the principal immediately without following the school's procedures could be seen as improper. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not adhering to the correct process, even if their intentions are to advocate for their child's education.\n"
