      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office without an appointment and was told to leave. The principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer, but the officer later commended the parent's calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. In the US, sex education is often mandated by state laws, and schools might follow specific curriculums. If the program includes distributing condoms and discussing topics like oral or anal sex, which some parents might find inappropriate for 10-11 year olds, there's a valid concern. However, the parent's approach might be seen as confrontational by entering without notice and demanding immediate answers. \n\nBut then, the principal's response was also questionable. Threatening to call the resource officer could be seen as an overreaction. The fact that the officer later supported the parent's actions suggests that the principal's response was excessive. \n\nThe parent did have a right to be concerned, especially if the content was beyond their child's developmental stage. However, the method of approaching the issue\u2014storming into the office\u2014might not have been the best approach. The parent could have first checked the school's curriculum and communicated through proper channels, like a letter or a meeting request. \n\nOn the other hand, the principal's refusal to engage and the threat could be a problem if the program is indeed inappropriate. The parent's actions were direct but not necessarily wrong, given the potential violation of child safety. The school resource officer's support indicates there might be room for the parent's concerns to be heard. \n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. The issue is complex, involving both the appropriateness of the content and the method of addressing it. The parent's reaction was strong, but the principal's response was also inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
