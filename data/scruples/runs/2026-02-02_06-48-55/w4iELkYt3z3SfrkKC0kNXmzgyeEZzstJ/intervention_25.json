She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the sex education program in their 5th grader's school is in the wrong. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they considered inappropriate for 10-11 year olds. They went to the principal's office in person and were told to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In the U.S., sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some areas have comprehensive sex education that includes information on consent, contraception, and various types of sexual activity, while others follow abstinence-only programs. The parent's concern might stem from the belief that certain topics are too advanced for their child's age.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach was confrontational. Walking into the principal's office and demanding answers without notice could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response, threatening to involve the resource officer, suggests that the parent's manner was inappropriate, even if their concerns were valid. \n\nThe key here is the method used to address the issue. While the parent's concerns might be legitimate, the right approach would be to follow proper channels: perhaps starting with a discussion with the teacher, then contacting the principal in a more formal and respectful manner, or reaching out to the school board. Confronting the principal in person without prior communication could be viewed as aggressive.\n\nAdditionally, the principal advised sending a letter, which is a standard way to handle formal complaints. The parent's in-person confrontation might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Even if the resource officer supported the parent's feeling, the method of expressing the complaint was not productive.\n\nMoreover, the content of the sex education program itself is debatable. Providing condoms to 5th graders is unusual, and teaching about oral and anal sex at that age might be beyond what some parents expect. However, the appropriateness of the curriculum depends on local laws and educational standards. The parent's reaction is about the content, but their approach to addressing it is about the method.\n\nSo, the parent is in the wrong for how they handled the complaint, not necessarily for having the concern itself. The way they approached the principal was aggressive and disruptive, which doesn't align with proper conflict resolution procedures. Therefore, the answer is A: the parent is in the wrong.\n"
