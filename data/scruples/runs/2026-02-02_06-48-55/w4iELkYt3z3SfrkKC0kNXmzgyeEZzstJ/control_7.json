She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for complaining to their 5th grader's school about the sex education program. The key points here are the content of the program, the age of the students, and the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, the parent is upset because their 10-11 year old received condoms and was taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office directly and demanded answers, leading to a confrontation where the principal wanted them to leave and possibly call the resource officer. The parent claims the topics are age-inappropriate.\n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some states require comprehensive sex ed, which includes topics like contraception and different types of sexual activity. However, there's a lot of debate about the appropriate age to teach these subjects. The parent might argue that 5th grade is too young, especially if the curriculum includes more advanced topics. On the other hand, schools might have a curriculum approved by the district, aiming to provide early education to prevent issues later. The parent's method of confronting the principal in person might be seen as aggressive, even if their concerns are legitimate. The principal's response to have them leave could be part of maintaining order, as schools might have procedures for parent complaints. However, the parent mentions that the resource officer commended them for being calm, which is a point in their favor.\n\nWhether the parent is in the wrong depends on a few factors: the legality of the school's curriculum, the appropriateness of the parent's reaction, and the school's policies. If the curriculum is in line with state guidelines, the parent's complaint might not be valid. But if the content is indeed age-inappropriate or goes beyond what's approved, the parent has a valid reason. The parent's approach could be seen as too confrontational, but the principal's threat to involve the resource officer might be excessive if the parent was merely expressing concerns. So, the parent might not be in the wrong for raising the issue, but their method could be questioned. However, if the school's program is compliant, the parent's complaint might not hold, but the school's response could also be overly harsh.\n"
