She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who complained about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides here.\n\nFirst, the parent's perspective: They found out their 10-11-year-old daughter was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. That's pretty intense for that age group. The parent went directly to the principal, demanded answers, and was told to leave, with a threat to involve the police. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who seemed to agree with them.\n\nOn the other side, schools often have policies about sex education, especially in public schools. They might follow guidelines that aim to provide comprehensive education, including age-appropriate information. Condom distribution could be part of a program to prevent pregnancy or STIs, but giving condoms to 11-year-olds is questionable. However, the method the parent used\u2014storming the principal's office and causing a scene\u2014might be seen as confrontational. The principal's response was to ask them to leave, which is a standard procedure for such situations.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's reaction. If the school provided materials that a parent finds inappropriate, the parent has the right to express concerns. However, the manner in which the parent did it\u2014storming in and demanding immediate answers\u2014might be considered inappropriate. Schools usually encourage parents to follow proper channels, like writing a formal complaint or meeting with the right officials.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the curriculum itself is age-appropriate. Teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex and giving them condoms might be seen as overstepping, especially if the parent wasn't informed or had the option to opt their child out. However, the parent's approach might have been too aggressive, which could have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nIn some cases, parents do have the right to opt out of certain educational programs, but the parent here didn't do that initially. They reacted after the fact. The school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene suggests that the parent's anger is valid, but the method of addressing it might still be questionable.\n\nSo, balancing the appropriateness of the school's actions versus the parent's response. The parent's concern is valid if the school didn't provide age-appropriate content or didn't inform them beforehand. However, the parent's approach was confrontational, which might have been the wrong way to handle it. The school's response was to enforce their policy, which might mean the parent is in the wrong for not following proper procedures first.\n"
