She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for complaining to their child's school about the sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office, demanded to know why their 5th grader was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The principal told them to leave and threatened to call the school resource officer. The parent says they're shocked because the child is only 10-11 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the parent's actions. In the US, parents have the right to be involved in their child's education, including curriculum content. However, the method the parent used might be an issue. Walking into the principal's office without an appointment and demanding answers could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response\u2014telling them to leave and threatening to involve the resource officer\u2014seems excessive, but the parent's approach might not have been the best either.\n\nNext, the content of the sex education. The topics mentioned\u2014condoms, oral and anal sex\u2014are typically part of comprehensive sex ed programs, which aim to provide age-appropriate information. However, the age of the students is key here. 5th grade is around 10-11 years old, which might be considered too young for such specific details, depending on the school's approach and local guidelines. Some schools might introduce basic sex ed at this age, but more advanced topics could be a point of contention.\n\nThe parent's right to voice concerns is valid, but the manner in which they did so could be problematic. Confronting the principal in person without scheduling a meeting might not be the most effective way to address concerns. The principal's response, however, might also indicate a lack of willingness to engage in dialogue. The fact that the school resource officer commended the parent suggests that the principal's threat was perhaps overzealous.\n\nIn terms of legality and policy, parents are usually given the option to opt their child out of sex education if they disagree. The parent might not be in the wrong for wanting to discuss the curriculum, but the approach could be seen as contributing to the conflict. It's a balance between the parent's rights and appropriate communication methods.\n\nSo, considering all points: the parent's concerns might be valid regarding the content's appropriateness for the age, but their method of addressing it was confrontational. The school's response was also harsh. The answer would hinge on whether the parent is in the wrong for their actions. Since the parent is raising a legitimate concern but in a disruptive way, there's a case that they are not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps their approach was flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Given that the principal's actions were also problematic, the parent's complaint might be justified, so the answer is more likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
