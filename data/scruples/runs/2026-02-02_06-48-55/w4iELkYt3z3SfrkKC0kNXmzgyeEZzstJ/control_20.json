She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program at their child's school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent found out that their 5th grader (around 10-11 years old) was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. They went to the principal's office to complain, and the principal asked them to leave. The school resource officer supported the parent's frustration. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, I should consider the age-appropriateness of the topics. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some schools start comprehensive sex ed early, but teaching 5th graders about advanced topics like oral and anal sex and providing condoms might be considered too mature. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that sex education should be age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate. For younger children, the focus is usually on body parts, consent, and personal safety, not detailed sexual acts.\n\nThe parent's reaction is to confront the school directly. While the method might be confrontational (walking into the principal's office, demanding answers), their concern about age-appropriate material is valid. The principal's response was to threaten involving the school resource officer, which might indicate a lack of willingness to address the parent's concerns constructively. However, the parent did have the option to follow up with a letter or contact other authorities if they felt the school wasn't addressing their concerns properly.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene suggests that while the parent's approach was calm compared to others, the underlying issue might still be valid. The key here is balancing the parent's right to question the curriculum with the school's responsibility to provide age-appropriate education. If the school's program is indeed going beyond what's appropriate for 5th graders, the parent is within their rights to voice concerns. However, the manner in which they approached the principal could be seen as disruptive, which might not be the most effective way to resolve the issue. The parent might be advised to follow proper channels for complaints, like written letters or contacting the school board, rather than an in-person confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has a legitimate concern about age-appropriate content, their approach might be seen as confrontational. However, the school's response in threatening to involve the resource officer is also problematic. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing concerns, but their method could be improved. The main issue is the school's curriculum being inappropriate for the age group, so the root problem is with the school's program, not the parent's initial reaction.\n"
