She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent complaining to their 5th-grade child's school about the sex education program. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate. The parent confronted the principal in person, leading to the principal threatening to have the resource officer remove them. The school resource officer, however, commended the parent for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The parent is upset about the content of the sex ed program. In the US, 5th grade is around 10-11 years old, which is a very young age. The parent's reaction includes walking into the principal's office and demanding an explanation, which might be seen as confrontational. The principal's response was to tell them to leave and send a letter instead, while the resource officer supported the parent's actions.\n\nI should consider the appropriateness of the content. Is it standard for 5th-grade sex ed to include topics like oral and anal sex and distribute condoms? From what I know, comprehensive sex education varies by state and school district. Some programs do start early, but giving condoms to 10-11-year-olds seems extreme. However, some schools might provide information and materials as part of teaching about safe sex and prevention, even if the parent finds it inappropriate.\n\nThe parent's method of addressing the issue is in question. Confronting the principal in person without an appointment and demanding answers might be seen as disruptive. However, the principal's response of threatening removal and the resource officer's support adds complexity. The parent did not escalate further, which the officer noted.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to opt their children out of sex education if the school allows it, depending on state laws. The parent might have had the right to complain, but the manner of doing so could be problematic. Schools typically have procedures for such concerns, like contacting via letter or parent-teacher meetings.\n\nEthically, the parent's concern is about age-appropriate content. If the materials are indeed inappropriate, the parent has a valid point. However, the method of confrontation might not be the most effective. The principal's response could be a policy to handle such situations by formal channels, and the parent's public approach might not align with that.\n\nAlso, the school resource officer's commendation suggests that the parent's actions, while confrontational, were not unwarranted. The officer's own reaction implies that he understands the parent's frustration, indicating that the issue might have merit.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's concern about the content might be justified, but the way they addressed it could be considered inappropriate. However, since the school's response was extreme (threatening removal), and the resource officer supported the parent, it's possible that the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the content is actually appropriate for that age and the correct procedures for lodging a complaint.\n"
