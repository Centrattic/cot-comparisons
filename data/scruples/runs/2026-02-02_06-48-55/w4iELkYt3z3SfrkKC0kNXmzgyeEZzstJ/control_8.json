She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program in their child's 5th-grade class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the post. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, who told them to leave and threatened involving a school resource officer. The principal also suggested sending a letter instead. The school resource officer, however, commended the parent for being peaceful.\n\nNow, evaluating the parent's actions. They walked into the principal's office unannounced and demanded explanations. This might be seen as confrontational. However, the parent is reacting to what they consider inappropriate content for a 10-11 year old. The school's response was to have them leave and possibly call the police, which seems aggressive.\n\nLooking at the school's policies. In many U.S. states, schools have certain guidelines about sex education. Some states require age-appropriate sex education. The specifics matter here. If the program is following state guidelines and the parent's complaint is about disagreement with the content, the parent might be within their rights to object but perhaps not the right way to handle it.\n\nThe parent's method of confrontation: walking in unannounced and being demanding could be seen as disruptive. However, the principal's response was to threaten removal, which might be overstepping. The fact that the school resource officer supported the parent's actions suggests that the school's response was excessive.\n\nIs the parent wrong for complaining? If the school's program includes content the parent finds inappropriate for the age group, they have the right to express concerns. But the method\u2014storming into the office and being confrontational\u2014might be the issue. Proper procedure might involve sending a letter or meeting through proper channels. However, the school's threat to involve police might be the bigger problem.\n\nIn terms of age-appropriateness: 5th grade is 10-11 years old. Topics like oral and anal sex and providing condoms might be considered too advanced for that age. Some curricula include comprehensive sex education starting in middle school, but 5th grade might be too young. It depends on local policies and what's considered appropriate.\n\nSo, the parent's concern is valid if the school is going beyond what's appropriate. However, their approach might not be the best way to handle it. The school's response was harsh. The parent isn't in the wrong for having concerns or expressing them, but maybe the manner of expression was problematic. However, the school's threat to involve police is concerning regardless.\n\nIn most cases, parents have the right to voice concerns about school curricula, especially regarding their child's education. The school's response should be to engage in dialogue, not threaten removal. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong for complaining, but the way they did it might have been unwise. However, the core issue of the school's content might be the root problem.\n"
