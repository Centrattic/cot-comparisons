She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining to the school about the sex education program. The parent went directly to the principal's office, demanded answers, and the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the officer, who seemed to agree with their frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade in the US is typically 10-11 years old. Are the topics being taught age-appropriate? The parent is upset about condoms and discussions on oral and anal sex. I know that comprehensive sex education can include a range of topics, but whether they're appropriate for that age might depend on the curriculum. However, the parent's approach might be the issue here. \n\nThe parent didn't follow the usual protocol. Instead of writing a letter or going through the proper channels, they stormed into the principal's office and demanded answers. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and suggested sending a letter. The parent's actions might be seen as confrontational. Even though the school resource officer commended their calmness, the method of approaching the school is aggressive. \n\nIn many educational systems, parents have the right to opt out of certain programs or express concerns through formal channels. The parent's right to complain isn't the issue here, but the manner in which they did it. Disrupting the principal's office and demanding immediate answers without following procedure could be considered inappropriate. The principal's threat to involve the resource officer might be a reaction to the parent's aggressive approach, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n\nSo, while the parent's concern might be justified depending on the curriculum's content, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate of the school's protocols. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not following proper procedures and causing a confrontation.\n"
