She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent went to the principal's office in person and demanded to know why their 5th grader was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The principal asked them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the officer, who commended their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's actions. Teaching 10-11 year olds about sexual topics, including giving out condoms, might be part of a comprehensive sex education program. Some schools include this to promote health education, even if some parents disagree. However, the specific content and age-appropriateness can be a point of contention.\n\nNext, the parent's approach. Walking into the principal's office demanding answers and causing a confrontation could be seen as aggressive or unprofessional. Schools often have protocols for parent concerns, like writing a formal letter first. By not following these steps and confronting the principal directly, the parent might have overstepped, leading to the principal's defensive reaction.\n\nThe principal's response\u2014threatening to call the resource officer\u2014might be excessive, but the parent's entry into the office without an appointment could have triggered that. However, the resource officer's comment suggests that even he would have taken a stronger stance, implying the parent's reaction isn't entirely unwarranted.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the parent's method of addressing their concerns was appropriate. While their concern might be valid, the manner in which they approached the school could be seen as the problem. Proper channels for voicing concerns should be followed, even if one is upset. The parent's public confrontation might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong for not using the correct procedures to address their concerns, even if their underlying issue is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
