She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The parent went to the principal's office in person, demanded answers, and was told to leave. The school resource officer commended their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the sex ed program. Teaching 10-11-year-olds about oral and anal sex and giving out condoms seems age-inappropriate. Most comprehensive sex ed programs in the U.S. typically start with basic topics like puberty and body changes around that age. More detailed information on intercourse and contraception usually comes in later grades, maybe middle or high school. So the school might be going beyond what's appropriate for 5th graders.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction. They confronted the principal in person, which might have been confrontational but wasn't violent. The principal asked them to leave and suggested sending a formal letter, which is standard procedure. The resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene but commended the parent's calmness suggests that while the parent was upset, their approach wasn't unreasonable. \n\nThe parent has a right to be concerned about their child's education and the appropriateness of the curriculum. However, the way they approached the principal\u2014storming in and demanding answers\u2014might not be the best method. Schools usually have processes for parents to follow, like formal letters or meetings. By bypassing that and confronting the principal directly, the parent might have overstepped, even if their concern is valid.\n\nSo, while the parent's concern is valid, their method of addressing it might be inappropriate. Schools are responsible for their curriculum, but parents also have rights to object. However, the appropriate way is through established channels. The parent's action could be seen as disruptive, even if well-intentioned. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, despite valid concerns.\n"
