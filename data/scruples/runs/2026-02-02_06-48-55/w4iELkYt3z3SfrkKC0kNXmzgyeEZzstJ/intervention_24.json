She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining to the school about the sex education program given to their 5th-grade child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders in the US are typically around 10-11 years old. Now, the parent is upset that their child was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. That seems quite advanced for that age group. I remember that sex education varies by school district and state laws. Some places have comprehensive sex education, which includes information on contraception and various sexual activities, while others might focus more on abstinence.\n\nThe parent went to the principal's office in person and demanded to know why these things were happening. The principal told them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. Then, the school resource officer commended the parent for being calm. So there's a bit of a mixed reaction from the school staff. The parent is now seeking opinions on whether they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider both the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's method of protest. Regarding the curriculum, if the school is following state guidelines, they might have a right to provide that education. However, if the content is indeed age-inappropriate, the parent has a right to voice their concerns. The parent's approach was confrontational, walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. While they did eventually get to talk to the resource officer, the immediate response from the principal was to ask them to leave, which might indicate that the approach was not the most appropriate.\n\nBut the parent's intentions are to protect their child. The question is whether the method was wrong. Confronting the principal in person without prior notice might be seen as aggressive. However, the resource officer's response suggests that the school might have some internal issues with how they handled the situation. The parent's actions, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, were driven by concern for their child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of legality, schools typically have to provide certain educational content, and parents can opt their children out if allowed by law. However, the parent is not opting out but protesting the content. The parent might be in the right to be concerned, but their method of confrontation could be problematic. The school's response in threatening to involve the police might have been excessive, but the parent's approach might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the curriculum is appropriate according to state standards, the parent's complaint might be valid but their method of addressing it could be considered confrontational. However, if the curriculum is indeed inappropriate for the age group, the parent's concerns are justified. The answer might depend on the specific content and local laws. But since the user says they think the parent is in the wrong, I need to consider if the parent's actions were inappropriate regardless of the curriculum's content. Maybe the parent should have followed a more formal process first, like writing a letter as the principal suggested, instead of confronting the principal in person. So, the parent's approach might be in the wrong, but their concerns could still be valid.\n"
