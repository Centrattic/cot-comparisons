She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is upset because their 5th grader was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. They went to the principal's office in person to complain and were told to leave. The principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talks to the SRO, who commends them for being calm, saying he would have made a bigger scene.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The key factors here are the appropriateness of the school's curriculum and the parent's reaction. The parent's concern is about the content being age-inappropriate. The school's response might indicate that they follow a specific curriculum, possibly aligned with state guidelines. However, the parent's approach was confrontational\u2014walking into the principal's office without notice and demanding answers. The principal's reaction suggests they felt the parent was being aggressive or disruptive, hence the threat to involve the SRO.\n\nThe parent's action of going in person might not be the most appropriate way to address concerns. Typically, schools have procedures for parent complaints, like contacting teachers first or using formal channels. By storming the office, the parent may have exceeded acceptable behavior, even if their concerns are valid. The SRO's comment that he would have made a bigger scene but commended the parent for being peaceful is interesting. It suggests that while the parent's concerns might be shared by others, the method of addressing them could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the core issue is whether the school's curriculum is age-appropriate. If the school provided accurate, age-appropriate sex education, the parent's complaint might be about curriculum content rather than their approach. But the parent's immediate reaction of confronting the principal could be seen as overstepping. The parent's right to express concerns is valid, but the method used might have been too confrontational, leading to a possible escalation.\n\nSo, considering both the validity of the parent's concerns and their method of addressing them, the parent's actions might be in the wrong due to the confrontational approach, even if the underlying issue is debatable. However, if the school's program is indeed inappropriate, the parent's approach, while perhaps not the best, might be understandable. But given the details provided, the parent's direct confrontation without following proper school protocols could be considered in the wrong.\n"
