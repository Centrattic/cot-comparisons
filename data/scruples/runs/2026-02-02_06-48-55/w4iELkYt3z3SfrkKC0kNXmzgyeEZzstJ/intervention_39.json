She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex ed program. The parent went to the principal's office, got told to leave, and even the school resource officer said he would have made a scene. The key here is understanding the appropriateness of the content and the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, the parent is upset because their 10-11 year old received condoms and was taught about oral and anal sex. In the US, there's a lot of debate about age-appropriate sex education. Some programs do start early, focusing on consent and body parts, but giving condoms and teaching about anal sex to 5th graders seems extreme. I think the school might be overstepping here. \n\nThen there's the parent's approach. They walked into the principal's office and demanded an explanation. The principal told them to leave, and the resource officer later commended the parent for being peaceful. The parent's confrontation might have been direct, but the resource officer supported their frustration. However, going to the principal's office directly without prior notice might be seen as disruptive. The principal had the right to ask them to leave if it was causing a disturbance. \n\nSo, the parent's actions might not be the worst. They have a right to be concerned about their child's education, and the school's methods might be questionable. The parent could have followed proper channels, like contacting the school via email or meeting with the principal at a scheduled time, rather than showing up unannounced. But the core issue is whether the school's program is appropriate. If the school is indeed providing that kind of education to 5th graders, the parent isn't in the wrong for objecting. The resource officer's support also suggests that the parent's concerns are valid. \n\nTherefore, the parent's actions, while perhaps a bit confrontational, are justified given the inappropriate content. The school's response was harsh, and the parent isn't at fault here.\n"
