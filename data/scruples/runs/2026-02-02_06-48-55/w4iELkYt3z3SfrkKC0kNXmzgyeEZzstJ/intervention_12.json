She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office in person and demanded an explanation, leading to a confrontation where the principal told them to leave and threatened involving the school resource officer. The parent also mentions that their 5th grader was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they found inappropriate for that age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Approaching the principal in person without notice and demanding answers could be seen as confrontational. Schools usually have procedures for such concerns, like sending a letter or scheduling a meeting. The parent's immediate reaction might have been impulsive and not following the proper channels, which could be why the principal reacted that way. However, the principal's response\u2014threatening to call the school resource officer\u2014seems excessive if the parent was just voicing a concern, even if done in a heated manner.\n\nNext, the content of the sex education program. The parent is upset about 10-11-year-olds being taught about advanced topics and given condoms. In the US, comprehensive sex education varies by state and district. Some areas do start sex ed at younger ages, covering topics like consent, anatomy, and maybe basic contraception. However, teaching oral/anal sex to 5th graders might be controversial. The appropriateness can depend on the curriculum's approach and whether it's age-appropriate. If the program is part of a broader health curriculum that includes consent and body safety, some might argue it's necessary. But if it's going into explicit details without context, that could be problematic.\n\nThe parent's right to raise concerns is valid. Parents have the right to be involved in their child's education and to voice disagreements. However, the method of confrontation (walking in and demanding answers) might have been inappropriate. The school resource officer's comment to the parent that they'd have made a scene but commended their calmness suggests that there's some understanding of the parent's frustration, but the principal's threat to involve the officer is a red flag. It's possible the principal overreacted, which could indicate a lack of proper procedures for handling parent concerns.\n\nLegally, schools in the US are required to educate students, but they must also respect parental rights. If the curriculum is part of a state-mandated program, parents can opt their children out, but the method of delivery (e.g., giving out condoms) might be another layer. The parent's complaint could lead to a review of the curriculum's appropriateness for the age group.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be justified in their concerns about the content being taught, but their method of addressing it was confrontational and perhaps not following the proper steps. The principal's response was overly aggressive. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been better handled. However, the core issue of the curriculum's appropriateness is a valid concern.\n"
