She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent went directly to the principal's office, demanded explanations, and was told to leave. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. In the US, comprehensive sex education often includes information beyond abstinence, sometimes covering topics like condom use and different types of sexual activity. However, the age of the children is 10-11, which might be considered young for such detailed information. The parent is upset about the age-appropriateness and the distribution of condoms to 5th graders.\n\nNext, the parent's approach: storming into the principal's office, demanding answers, and being confrontational. While the parent's concerns might be valid, the method of addressing them could be problematic. Schools typically have protocols for parent concerns, like written communication or scheduled meetings. The parent's direct and immediate confrontation might be seen as disruptive or unprofessional, hence the principal's reaction. The principal's threat to remove the parent could be an overreaction, but the parent's initial approach might have contributed to the situation.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment suggests that while he understands the parent's anger, he praised their calmness. This indicates that the parent's approach, while impassioned, wasn't overly confrontational. However, the method of bringing up such a sensitive issue without following proper channels could be seen as the parent's fault in terms of how they handled it.\n\nLegally and educationally, there might be guidelines about what's taught in each grade. If the school is following state or district mandates, the parent's complaint might not hold, but that's a different aspect. The question is about whether the parent is in the wrong for their actions, not the school's curriculum.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's concern might be justified, but their approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong for their method).\n"
