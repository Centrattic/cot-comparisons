She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent complaining to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate for 10-11 year olds. The parent confronted the principal, who told them to leave and threatened involving the school resource officer. However, the school resource officer thought the parent was acting appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational standards in the US regarding sex education. In many states, schools are allowed to teach sex education, but the content and age appropriateness can vary. Some states require that schools provide comprehensive sex education, which might include topics like consent, anatomy, and contraception. However, giving condoms to elementary school students is a point of contention. Some might argue that it's preparing them for future health, while others see it as inappropriate for that age group.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational. They walked into the principal's office without notice and demanded answers, which could be seen as disrespectful or violating school procedures. Schools often have protocols for parent concerns, like written communication or scheduled meetings. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and follow proper channels, which might be standard protocol to maintain order.\n\nHowever, the school resource officer commended the parent for staying calm, which suggests that the parent's intent wasn't malicious. The parent's concern about age-appropriate content is valid, especially if the curriculum includes topics that many find unsuitable for 5th graders. The key question is whether the parent overstepped by their method of confrontation.\n\nOn one hand, the parent has a right to be concerned about their child's education and to voice objections. On the other hand, the manner in which they did so might be considered inconsiderate or improper. The answer would depend on whether the content is indeed age-appropriate according to the school's policies and state laws, and whether the parent's reaction was a reasonable response to their concerns.\n\nIn many cases, parents are encouraged to address concerns through proper channels first. Confronting a principal in person without following procedures can be seen as AITA, especially if it disrupts school operations. However, if the content is genuinely inappropriate, the parent's concern is justified, but the approach could be improved.\n\nSo, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong for their concern, but their method of confrontation could be problematic. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is the content being age-inappropriate, but the parent's approach was flawed. However, some might argue that the parent was justified in their approach given the principal's hostile response. But given the standard AITA framework, the parent's method is often seen as inconsiderate, leading to answer A. But I need to verify.\n"
