She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for complaining about the school's sex education program.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The parent found out their 5th-grade daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office and complained, leading to the principal threatening to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the resource officer, who commended their approach.\n\nNow, considering the age of the students, 5th grade is around 10-11 years old. The parent is upset about the content and materials used. The school's response was to demand a letter and involve the resource officer if necessary. \n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, while others allow parents to opt their children out. The key here is whether the school's curriculum aligns with local laws and the school's policies. If the school has a policy that's been approved and communicated to parents, then the parent's complaint might be about policy disagreement rather than the school violating any rules.\n\nHowever, the parent's method of confrontation\u2014walking into the principal's office and demanding answers\u2014might have been seen as disruptive. The principal's response was to insist on a formal letter, which is a standard procedure for formal complaints. The parent's immediate reaction might have been too confrontational, leading to the threat of involving the officer. But the school resource officer actually commended them for staying calm, which suggests the parent's approach wasn't overly aggressive.\n\nThe main issue is whether the school provided age-appropriate content. If the school's curriculum includes topics that are considered inappropriate for 10-11-year-olds, then the parent has a valid concern. However, if the school follows the state or district guidelines, even if the parent disagrees, they might not be in the wrong for voicing their opinion, but their method might have been unwise.\n\nBut the parent's action of confronting the principal in person and the principal's response could lead to whether the parent overstepped. The parent might have a right to complain, but the manner (storming into the office) might not be the best approach. However, the resource officer's support suggests the parent's actions were not entirely wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the parent's concern might be valid if the content is inappropriate, but the way they approached the school could be seen as disruptive. However, in many cases, parents do have the right to express concerns about school content, especially if they believe it's inappropriate. The school's policy on opt-outs and prior communication matters here. If the parent wasn't informed beforehand, that's a problem. If the school did communicate, then the parent's right to complain is still valid, but their method might not be the best. However, since the resource officer supported them, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any legal or policy aspect I'm missing.\n"
