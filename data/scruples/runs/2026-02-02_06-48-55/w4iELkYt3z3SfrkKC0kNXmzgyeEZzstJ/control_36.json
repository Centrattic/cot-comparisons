She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent's daughter is in 5th grade (around 10-11 years old), and the parent is upset because the school provided condoms and taught topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, was asked to leave, and the school resource officer supported their frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the sex ed program. Teaching 10-11-year-olds about advanced sexual topics like oral and anal sex, along with providing condoms, seems questionable. Age-appropriate sex education typically starts with basic body parts, personal boundaries, and consent, not detailed sexual acts. However, some schools might include comprehensive sex education that covers relationships and protection, but the specifics here are concerning.\n\nThe parent's reaction: walking into the principal's office and demanding an explanation. While confrontational, the parent did not use violence. The principal's response was to threaten the school resource officer, which is a possible overreaction. The resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the school's handling might be problematic.\n\nLegally, parents have rights to be informed about their children's education and to voice concerns. However, the method of confrontation (storming the office) might be inappropriate. The parent should have perhaps followed proper channels first, like contacting the teacher or school board. Still, the school's immediate threat of police involvement could indicate a lack of willingness to engage in dialogue, which is also an issue.\n\nIn terms of content appropriateness, there's a debate between comprehensive sex education and abstinence-only. However, teaching advanced sexual acts to 5th graders seems beyond age-appropriate. Condom distribution at this age is also unusual unless the program is part of a broader health curriculum addressing safety in a very mature context, which isn't standard.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's concerns are valid regarding the content's suitability. The school's response was aggressive and dismissive. While the parent's approach could be more constructive, the core issue lies with the school's curriculum and their handling of the parent's complaint. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong for voicing concerns about what appears to be age-inappropriate material.\n"
