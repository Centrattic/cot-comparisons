She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th-grade daughter being given condoms and taught advanced sexual topics. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child\u20145th grade in the US is typically 10-11 years old. The parent is upset that condoms were given out and topics like oral and anal sex were discussed. The school's response was to ask the parent to leave and mention possible involvement of the school resource officer.\n\nI should check what is standard in sex education programs. In the US, there's variation, but some schools do provide comprehensive sex education which includes information on consent, puberty, and sometimes contraception. However, giving out condoms to 5th graders might be unusual. At that age, children are generally introduced to puberty and basic body parts, but more specific information like condoms and oral/anal sex might be considered too advanced.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational, walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. While the parent might have been concerned, the method of confrontation could be seen as disruptive. However, the parent's concerns might be valid if the content was inappropriate for the age group.\n\nThe school's response, threatening to involve law enforcement, could be an overreaction. Schools usually have protocols for parent complaints, but threatening removal might be excessive. However, the parent's conduct in entering the office unannounced might have contributed to the school's response.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to be informed about their child's education and to express concerns. However, how they do it matters. The parent's right to voice concerns exists, but the method (storming into the office) might not be the best approach. The school resource officer's comment that he would have done the same if he were the parent suggests that the parent's concerns are shared by others, but the way they were expressed is questionable.\n\nIn terms of appropriateness, teaching 10-year-olds about condoms and advanced sexual acts is likely inappropriate. Most sex ed curricula in the US for that age focus on puberty, body changes, and basic safety. The parent is justified in being concerned about the content. However, the parent's method of addressing it\u2014confronting the principal abruptly\u2014might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle the issue.\n\nSo, balancing the content of the education and the parent's approach, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong regarding the content, but their method of expressing the complaint could be seen as problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is the content being taught, the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong about the content, but perhaps their approach.\n"
