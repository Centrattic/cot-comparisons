She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author of the Reddit post) is in the wrong for complaining to their child's school about the sex education program. The key points here are the content of the program and the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, the parent says their 5th grader (10-11 years old) was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, got told to leave, and the principal threatened to call the school resource officer. But the officer later commended the parent for being peaceful. \n\nNow, I need to consider what's appropriate for a 5th-grade sex ed program. In the US, sex education varies by state and school district. Some schools start comprehensive sex ed younger, covering topics like puberty, consent, and basic anatomy. However, teaching about specific sexual acts like oral or anal sex might be considered more advanced. Condom distribution to such young kids is also a point of contention. Some argue it's important for safety, but others feel it's too early.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational\u2014storming into the principal's office. That's probably not the best way to address concerns, as it can be seen as aggressive. However, their concern about the content might be valid. The school's response (threatening removal) could be seen as dismissive of parental concerns, even if the parent's method was poor.\n\nBut there's another angle: maybe the school followed the curriculum correctly. If the program is age-appropriate according to guidelines, then the parent's reaction might be unwarranted. However, if the content is indeed inappropriate for 10-year-olds, the parent is justified in their complaint. \n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the principal's response was overly harsh. This might indicate that the parent's concerns were taken seriously by some but not by others. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's method could be criticized for being confrontational, but their concern might be valid. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for complaining. If the school's program is within standard guidelines, the parent might be in the wrong. But if the program is indeed inappropriate, the parent is justified. \n\nBut since the answer requires a yes or no, and given that the parent's approach was aggressive (storming into the office) and the content might not be fully inappropriate (some sex ed at this age is standard), the answer could lean towards the parent being in the wrong. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in some regions, this is standard, but the distribution of condoms to 5th graders might be a red flag. \n\nConsidering that the principal threatened to involve the police, but the resource officer supported the parent's approach, there's a conflict in how the school handled the situation. This might mean the parent wasn't in the wrong in raising concerns, even if the method was poor. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because parents have the right to question school content that seems inappropriate. However, the approach could have been better. The school's response was also questionable. So the parent isn't in the wrong for voicing their concern, even if the method was hasty.\n"
