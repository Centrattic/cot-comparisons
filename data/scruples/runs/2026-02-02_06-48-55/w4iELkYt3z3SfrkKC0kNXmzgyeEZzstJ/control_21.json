She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who complained to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent found out their 10-11-year-old daughter was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal directly, leading to a threat of involving the school resource officer. The principal said to send a letter instead.\n\nNow, the key points here are the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's reaction. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some schools provide comprehensive sex education, while others offer abstinence-based programs. However, teaching detailed methods of sexual acts and distributing condoms to 5th graders is a contentious issue. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents usually have the right to be informed about the curriculum and sometimes to opt their children out. However, the method of the parent's complaint matters. The parent didn't follow the proper procedure by showing up unannounced and demanding answers, which led to a confrontation. The principal's reaction, while perhaps heavy-handed, might be within their right to maintain order.\n\nThe parent's actions were confrontational, but their concern about age-appropriate content is valid. Many experts suggest that sex education should be age-appropriate, and 5th grade might be too young for certain topics. However, the parent's approach (storming into the office, not following protocol) may have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent for being peaceful is interesting. It suggests that while the school has procedures, the parent's actions might be seen as reasonable by some. However, the parent still overstepped by not following the proper channels first.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intent to protect their child is understandable, but their method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. Therefore, the parent is partially at fault for not following the correct procedures, even if their concerns are valid. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
