She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who complained about their child's school's sex education program is in the wrong. The child is in 5th grade, so around 10-11 years old. The parent found out about condoms being given out and topics like oral and anal sex being taught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the US, sex education varies by state and district. Some places start comprehensive sex ed earlier, but giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching advanced topics at that age might be considered too advanced. However, some programs do include age-appropriate information, so it depends on the specific curriculum.\n\nThen there's the parent's reaction. They went directly to the principal's office, demanded explanations, and were told to leave. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the officer, who commended them for staying calm. The parent's approach was confrontational, which might not be the best method even if they have valid concerns.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, they have the right to be concerned and voice their opinion. However, the method of confrontation without prior communication (like contacting the school first) might be problematic. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, and approaching the principal abruptly could be seen as disruptive. The parent might not be wrong in their concerns but could have handled it differently.\n\nAlso, the school's response\u2014threatening to involve the police\u2014might be excessive. The parent's right to complain is valid, but the manner in which they did so could be an issue. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but their approach might be. However, the school's response was also questionable. The answer depends on whether the parent's actions were reasonable given their concerns and the school's policies.\n"
