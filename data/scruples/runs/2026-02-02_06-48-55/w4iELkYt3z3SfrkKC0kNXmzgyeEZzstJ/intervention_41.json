She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent complaining to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate. The parent confronted the principal in person, leading to a conflict where the principal threatened involvement of the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended their calmness but also said they would have done the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the parent acted appropriately. The parent's reaction was immediate and confrontational. While they might be concerned about their child's education, walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding answers could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response\u2014telling the parent to leave and threatening to involve an officer\u2014suggests that the parent's approach was not the right way to handle the issue. However, the parent's concern about the curriculum's appropriateness is valid because 5th graders (ages 10-11) might be too young for such topics. Schools often have age-appropriate sex education guidelines, but there might be a misunderstanding about the content or materials used. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's method of addressing the issue and the school's response. While the parent's concerns could be valid, their approach was confrontational and potentially inappropriate. The principal might have protocols for handling parent concerns, such as written communication or scheduled meetings. The parent's actions might have escalated the situation unnecessarily, leading to the threat of involving the resource officer. However, the resource officer's comment that he would have done the same might indicate that the parent's concerns are shared by others or that the situation was tense. \n\nIn terms of the content of the sex education program, it's possible that the curriculum includes comprehensive sex education that covers various aspects of relationships and health, but the inclusion of condoms and detailed sexual topics at this age could be problematic. However, the parent's method of addressing it\u2014storming into the office and demanding answers\u2014might not be the best approach. Schools might prefer parents to follow established procedures for grievances. \n\nSo, considering both the content of the education and the method of protest, the parent might be at fault for their approach, even if their concerns are valid. The answer would likely be A (the parent is in the wrong) for the way they handled the situation, though the content itself might be questionable. However, the main issue here is the parent's actions, not the school's curriculum. The parent's confrontational behavior and the principal's response suggest that the parent's approach was inappropriate, even if the underlying concern has merit. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
