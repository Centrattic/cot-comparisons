She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who went to the principal's office, got threatened with the school resource officer, and then the resource officer supported the parent's approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They walked into the principal's office and demanded an explanation. The principal told them to leave and threatened to involve the police. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who commended their peacefulness. \n\nThe content being taught includes giving out condoms and discussing topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11-year-olds. This seems like a very sensitive issue. The parent is upset and wants to know if they're in the wrong. \n\nI should think about the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the U.S., sex education standards vary by state and district. Some states require comprehensive sex education, which includes topics beyond abstinence. However, 5th grade might be too young for such detailed discussions, especially if it includes methods of contraception and specific sexual acts. \n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational, entering the principal's office without an appointment and demanding answers. The principal's response was also aggressive, threatening to call the police. The resource officer's support of the parent's actions adds another layer\u2014maybe the principal overreacted, but the parent's method might still be questionable. \n\nIs the parent wrong for being upset? Possibly not, especially if the content is indeed inappropriate. However, the method of confrontation could be seen as aggressive. But the resource officer supported their approach, so maybe the principal was being too harsh. \n\nIn terms of the parent's right to complain: they have the right to express concerns about their child's education. However, the manner in which they did it\u2014storming into the office and demanding immediate answers\u2014might not be the best approach. Yet, given the gravity of the situation, some might argue it's understandable. \n\nThe key points are the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's right to voice concerns. If the school's program is against local laws or is indeed inappropriate for the age group, the parent is justified. However, if the school's program is in line with guidelines, then the parent's reaction might be seen as overstepping. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's intent was to express a valid concern, and the resource officer's support suggests that the principal's response was excessive. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong, especially if the school's program is indeed inappropriate.\n"
