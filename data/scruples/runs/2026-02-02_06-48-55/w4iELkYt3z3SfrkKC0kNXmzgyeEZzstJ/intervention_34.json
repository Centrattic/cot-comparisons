She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who complained to the school about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the sex ed program. The parent is upset that their 10-11-year-old daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. In the US, sex education standards vary by state and district. Some areas have comprehensive sex ed that includes information on contraception and different types of sexual activity, while others follow abstinence-only curricula. \n\nThe parent's reaction was to confront the principal in person, leading to a confrontation where the principal asked them to leave. The parent then spoke to the school resource officer, who actually agreed with their concern. The parent is questioning whether it's appropriate for that age group.\n\nI need to assess if the parent's actions were reasonable. Confronting the principal in person might be seen as aggressive, but the parent's concern about age-appropriate content is valid. However, the method of addressing the issue could be debated. Instead of storming in, perhaps using the proper channels like writing a letter or contacting the PTA first might be more effective. The parent did mention sending a letter if they feel strongly, so maybe they are following up appropriately.\n\nThe key points are: the appropriateness of the content for 5th graders and the parent's method of addressing the issue. If the school's program is in line with state guidelines and the parent disagrees, they have the right to opt their child out. However, the public confrontation might not be the best approach. The parent's anger is understandable given the content, but the manner in which they addressed it could be seen as confrontational rather than collaborative.\n\nIn terms of the content, some states require comprehensive sex ed, so the school might be following regulations. However, if the parent believes the content is inappropriate, they might have a valid point. The school's response of threatening to involve the resource officer seems excessive and potentially inappropriate, as parents have rights to raise concerns.\n\nSo, the parent's actions might be seen as in the wrong if they disrupted the school without proper procedure. However, the school's handling of the parent's concern could also be at fault. The parent's right to question their child's education is valid, but the approach matters. The answer might depend on whether the school's program is compliant with local laws and if the parent used the correct channels. Since the parent is asking if they're in the wrong, considering both the content and the method, the answer could be nuanced. But the initial confrontation might be seen as overstepping, making the parent at least partially in the wrong.\n"
