She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about their 5th grader's sex education program is at fault. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the sex education program. The parent mentions that their daughter was given a condom and taught about oral and anal sex. That does seem quite advanced for 10-11 year olds. In the US, sex education varies by state and school district. Some programs start with comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like anatomy, consent, and contraception, while others focus on abstinence-only. However, teaching detailed sexual acts and providing condoms to elementary students might be beyond the typical curriculum for that age group.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction: they went directly to the principal's office and demanded answers. The principal asked them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended their composure. The parent is seeking validation from others, asking if it's normal to be upset about this.\n\nNow, considering the appropriateness of the parent's actions. Confronting the principal in person might not be the most effective way to raise concerns. A more constructive approach might be to follow the school's procedures for addressing concerns, like contacting the principal in advance or writing a formal letter. However, the parent's concern is about the content of the program, which is a legitimate issue for a parent. Schools have a duty to inform parents about the curriculum, especially if it includes sensitive topics. If the parent was not adequately informed, that's a separate issue.\n\nThe principal's response of threatening removal might be excessive. While schools have policies to maintain order, threatening law enforcement for a parent's concern could be seen as an overreaction. The school resource officer's support suggests that the parent's concerns are valid, at least in someone else's eyes.\n\nIn terms of the content itself, providing condoms to 5th graders is unusual. Condom distribution is more common in high schools where students might be sexually active. For elementary students, the focus is usually on basic anatomy, consent, and healthy relationships. Teaching about specific sexual acts like oral and anal sex might be inappropriate for that age unless it's in the context of broader discussions about sexual health, which is still questionable.\n\nSo, the parent is likely correct in feeling that the curriculum is age-inappropriate. The school's approach may have been flawed in both content and communication. However, the parent's method of confronting the principal in person could be seen as abrupt. A more appropriate approach might have been to first request a meeting or submit written concerns. That said, the parent's core concern is valid, so the answer might hinge on whether their method of expressing the concern was wrong, even if the concern itself is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't in the wrong for expressing their concern, especially if the curriculum is indeed inappropriate. The school's response might be the more problematic part. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
