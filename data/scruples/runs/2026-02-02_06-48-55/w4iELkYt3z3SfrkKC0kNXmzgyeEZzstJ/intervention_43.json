She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program at their child's school. The key points here are the age of the kids (5th grade, around 10-11 years old), the content of the program (including condoms, oral/anal sex), and the parent's reaction (confronting the principal, being told to leave, and interacting with the school resource officer).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the U.S., comprehensive sex education often includes topics like consent, anatomy, contraception, and different types of sexual activity. However, there's a debate about the age at which these topics are introduced. Some argue that comprehensive sex ed should start earlier to educate children about their bodies and relationships, while others believe certain topics are too advanced for younger grades.\n\nThe parent is upset that their child received a condom and was taught about oral and anal sex. The school's response was to tell the parent to leave if they have issues, which might indicate a lack of willingness to engage in a dialogue. However, the school resource officer commended the parent for not causing more disruption, suggesting some level of understanding of the parent's concern.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: entering the principal's office without an appointment and demanding answers could be seen as confrontational. Schools generally prefer parents to follow proper procedures, like sending a letter or meeting during scheduled times. The parent's approach might have been too direct and aggressive, which could explain the principal's reaction.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern is valid in the sense that they might feel the content is inappropriate for the age group. The appropriateness of the curriculum is subjective and depends on the community's standards and the school's policies. If the school followed state guidelines or had parental opt-out options, the parent might have a point. But without that context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe parent could have approached the issue differently, perhaps by first reviewing the curriculum, checking if there was prior notice, or following the school's procedure for complaints. By storming the office, they might have escalated the situation unnecessarily, which could make them at fault for the manner in which they raised their concerns, even if the concerns themselves are legitimate.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's concerns about the content might be valid, the way they addressed the issue (confrontational and without following proper channels) could make them partially at fault. However, if the school's program is indeed inappropriate and didn't have opt-out policies, the fault might lie more with the school. The answer hinges on the balance between the parent's right to complain and the method used to do so.\n"
