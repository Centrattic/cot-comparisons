The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for telling a preteen that they're not trans and shouldn't self-diagnose. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a Discord server where a 15-year-old is talking about wanting hormone therapy because they think they're trans. The author questions them, points out they haven't seen a psychologist, and then writes a detailed response with statistics about gender dysphoria rates and how most kids outgrow it. The community reacts negatively, calling the author an asshole, and they get banned as a homophobe.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was wrong to question the kid's self-diagnosis. Let's consider the arguments for both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about the kid possibly misdiagnosing themselves, using statistical data to argue that most people who say they're trans aren't actually experiencing gender dysphoria, and that many outgrow it. They mention mental health research and their own experience with a rare mental illness to support their point. The author's intention might be to encourage the kid to seek professional help rather than jump into hormone therapy, which is a big step. From a medical perspective, self-diagnosis can be problematic, especially for something as complex as gender identity. The author might be trying to protect the kid from potential harm by not rushing into medical decisions without proper evaluation.\n\nOn the other hand, the way the author presented their argument could be seen as dismissive and invalidating. The tone of the message, including phrases like \"likely isn't trans,\" \"prepubescent bullshit,\" and the implication that the kid is lying or confused, could come across as hostile. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach might have been harmful. Trans youth often face a lot of skepticism and invalidation, and questioning their identity without proper context or sensitivity can be damaging. Additionally, the author generalized statistics about gender dysphoria to an individual case, which might not be appropriate. Each person's experience is unique, and using statistics to dismiss someone's identity can be seen as a form of transphobia or at least transmisogyny, especially when directed at a minor.\n\nAnother point to consider is the community's reaction. The server members defended the kid, suggesting that they don't need a diagnosis to be valid. This reflects the current cultural emphasis on self-identification in the trans community. While some argue that medical professionals should be involved in the transition process, others believe that individuals should have autonomy over their identity. The author's approach might have crossed a line by not respecting the kid's self-identification and instead implying they're not valid, which can contribute to a hostile environment for trans youth.\n\nAlso, the author's use of phrases like \"homophobe\" as a slur from the moderators might be a misunderstanding. Homophobia typically refers to fear or hatred of LGBTQ+ people, but if the author is questioning a specific identity without attacking the person's worth, it's more about skepticism or concern rather than hatred. However, the way it was communicated could be perceived as discriminatory, leading to the ban.\n\nIn terms of the statistics cited, while they might be accurate, applying them to an individual case isn't valid. Just because many people experience dysphoria that resolves doesn't mean this kid is in that group. The author's conclusion that \"most people who say they're trans aren't\" is a generalization that can be harmful. It's possible the kid is genuinely experiencing dysphoria, and the author's response could discourage them from seeking help or expressing their identity.\n\nMoreover, the author's response may have been condescending. The part where they mention their own rare illness and compare it to gender dysphoria (suggesting that if it's rare, the vocal presence online is disproportionate) might be minimizing the kid's experience. That comparison could be seen as invalidating.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern about the kid's self-diagnosis might have a basis in some research, the way they expressed it\u2014disparagingly, with statistical generalizations, and a dismissive tone\u2014likely contributed to an environment that's not supportive of the trans youth. The community's reaction and the ban suggest that the author's approach was not appropriate, even if their intention was to caution against self-diagnosis. The line between concern and transphobia can be thin, and in this case, the author's message crossed it by being invalidating and potentially harmful.\n"
