The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling a preteen that they likely aren't trans and shouldn't self-diagnose. The author was banned from a Discord server for being called a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author confronted a 15-year-old who's struggling with gender identity issues and hasn't seen a psychologist. The author cited statistics suggesting that most people who feel this way might not actually have gender dysphoria, especially since many outgrow it. The author's intention was to question the validity of the kid's self-diagnosis and discourage rushed decisions about hormone therapy. However, the community reacted negatively, calling the author an asshole and leading to a ban.\n\nNow, I should consider the ethical aspects. Gender identity is a sensitive and personal matter. While the author's points might be technically correct based on some studies, how they approached the situation matters. The key here is the context: the person is a minor and possibly vulnerable. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if based on data, can be harmful. Self-diagnosis in mental health can be tricky, but for a teenager, peer support is crucial. The author might have intended to help by encouraging professional consultation, but the delivery was confrontational and judgmental.\n\nAlso, the server's rules against homophobia might have been triggered by the author's comments, even if they were framed as concern. The term \"homophobe\" here is used by the mods, but the author's argument is about trans issues. However, the line between questioning self-diagnosis and being transphobic can be thin. The author's statement that \"most people who say they are trans simply are not\" can come off as dismissive of the trans experience, which could be seen as transphobic regardless of the statistics cited.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to advocate for caution regarding irreversible treatments for a teenager. There's a valid concern about medical interventions without proper evaluation. But the method\u2014publicly calling out the kid, using statistics to invalidate their feelings\u2014might not be the right approach. It's possible that the server values emotional support over critical questioning, especially for minors.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention might be well-meaning, but the execution was likely harmful and dismissive. The community's reaction, while possibly overzealous, is rooted in protecting a vulnerable individual. The author might not be a homophobe, but their comments crossed into problematic territory by invalidating the kid's experience. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
