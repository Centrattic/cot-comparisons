The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a Discord server where a preteen is talking about being transgender and wanting hormone therapy without having seen a psychologist. The author questioned the kid's self-diagnosis, cited some statistics about the prevalence of gender dysphoria and how many cases resolve after puberty, and then was called a homophobe and banned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The server is semi-private, and the user is an adult interacting with a 15-year-old. The author's concern seems to be about the kid possibly not being trans and the risks of self-diagnosis. But the author's approach was to publicly question the kid's identity, using statistics to argue that most people who say they're trans aren't actually trans. The server members and mods took offense, leading to the ban.\n\nNow, the key points here. Was the author wrong to question the self-diagnosis? There's a difference between expressing concern and invalidating someone's identity. Even if someone is unsure about their own identity, directly stating that they \"likely aren't trans\" can be hurtful and dismissive. The author's tone comes across as condescending, using phrases like \"prepubescent bullshit,\" which is disrespectful. Also, the author cited studies but maybe didn't consider the nuances, like the difference between gender dysphoria and being transgender. Some people may experience dysphoria and still identify as transgender, even if the dysphoria resolves later. Also, the author's own experience with a mental illness was mentioned, but that doesn't necessarily validate their stance here.\n\nAnother angle is the server's rules. The moderator said they don't tolerate homophobes. The author's message might be seen as transphobic, even if they meant to be cautious. Supporting a minor's self-identified gender is often encouraged, especially in online communities, to create a safe space. By questioning the kid's identity publicly and asserting they're not trans, the author might have violated the server's code of conduct, leading to the ban.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of medical advice. The author isn't a professional, and advising a minor on such a sensitive issue without professional guidance could be problematic. However, the line between concern and discrimination is thin here. The author's intention might have been to encourage professional help, but the delivery was harsh and dismissive.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like their approach was not just factually questionable but also disrespectful. Even if some people later detransition, it's not the place of an outsider to publicly declare someone's identity invalid. The server's reaction, while possibly excessive, is about creating a safe space where such identities aren't challenged. The author's use of statistics could be seen as weaponizing data to invalidate personal experiences, which is a common issue in discussions about gender identity.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because they invalidated someone's identity in a harmful way, even if their concerns were about well-being. The method and tone were inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n"
