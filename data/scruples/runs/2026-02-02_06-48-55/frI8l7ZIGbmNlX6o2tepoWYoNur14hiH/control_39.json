The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. So, the author of the post was banned from a Discord server for questioning a 15-year-old's self-identification as trans without a psychologist's evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was part of a server where a teenager is seeking hormone therapy but hasn't seen a psychologist. The author's main point was that the teenager likely isn't trans, citing statistics about gender dysphoria rates and arguing that most people who self-diagnose might be mistaken or influenced by other factors. The moderator accused them of being a homophobe, leading to a ban.\n\nNow, the key here is understanding the dynamics between supporting a minor's self-identification and being critical of it. On one hand, the author is concerned about the teenager possibly being misdiagnosing themselves, especially given the lack of professional evaluation. They reference studies and statistics to back their point, which might be seen as trying to provide factual support. However, the way they presented this could be problematic. Telling a teenager that they \"likely aren't trans\" and dismissing their feelings might be hurtful and invalidating. \n\nOn the other hand, the community in the server seems to have reacted negatively to the author's questioning. They defended the teenager, emphasizing that self-identification is valid. The server's rules against homophobes would apply here if the author's comments were considered discriminatory. But is pointing out potential self-diagnosis considered homophobia? That's a bit tricky. Homophobia is about prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals, but the author's concern is about the accuracy of a self-diagnosis rather than the person's identity itself. However, the effect of the message could be seen as harmful, even if the intent was to help.\n\nThe author's approach might not be malicious, but the impact on a vulnerable individual (a preteen) could be harmful. Even if the author is factually correct about the statistics, the manner in which they delivered the message\u2014publicly questioning the teenager's identity without professional context\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Mental health professionals do emphasize the importance of support and non-judgmental environments for individuals exploring their identity. \n\nAlso, the server's community likely values affirming the teen's self-identification, which is a common supportive approach. By challenging that, the author might be violating the community's guidelines, which prioritize creating a safe space. So, the ban might be justified based on those community standards. \n\nHowever, from a factual standpoint, the author isn't wrong in citing that some teens may experience desistance from gender dysphoria. But the way they framed their argument\u2014publicly labeling the teen as likely not trans without a professional assessment\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially in a space meant to support LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent might have been to provide a factual perspective, but the method and impact on the teenager and the community's dynamics suggest that their approach was inappropriate. Therefore, they might be in the wrong in this scenario.\n"
