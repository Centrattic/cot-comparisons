The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs. Read some actual god damn articles and crap on this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting a preteen about possibly being transgender without proper diagnosis, which led to their ban from a Discord server.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is arguing that because the kid hasn't seen a psychologist and is self-diagnosing, there's a high chance they aren't actually transgender. They cite statistics about gender dysphoria prevalence and note that many cases resolve after puberty. The server banned them as a homophobe. \n\nSo, the main question is whether calling out a minor for self-diagnosis and suggesting they might not be trans is wrong. From a social standpoint, trans rights are often protected, and questioning someone's identity can be seen as transphobic. But the author is concerned about the kid's self-diagnosis and potential mental health implications. However, even if the author's intent is to protect the kid, the way they expressed it might be harmful. \n\nSelf-diagnosis is a common issue, especially in youth. The author's approach was to publically challenge the kid's self-identification, which can be hurtful. Even if there's a statistical argument, applying it to an individual case can be seen as invalidating their experience. The server's community guidelines likely prioritize respecting individual identity regardless of external validation. \n\nAlso, the author's comments might come across as dismissive of the kid's feelings, which can have negative emotional impacts. While the author isn't saying the kid is lying, the implication that they're probably not trans could be harmful. The ban, according to the moderator, was for homophobia, which the author argues against, but the community's stance seems to be against such questioning. \n\nI should consider the balance between supporting youth exploring their identity and the risk of misdiagnosis. The author's approach might be seen as not supporting the kid's autonomy in their journey. Even if the statistics are correct, making a generalization about the individual can be problematic. The author's right to express their opinion versus the community's need to create a safe space for all members, including trans youth, is a key factor here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author may have had intentions to prevent the kid from making a hasty decision, the method used was likely inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
