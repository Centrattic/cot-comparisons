The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was banned from a Discord server for questioning a preteen about their self-identified trans status. The author argues that the kid hasn't seen a psychologist and is likely not actually trans, citing some statistics about gender dysphoria rates. The mods labeled them a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in question is a 15-year-old who hasn't consulted a professional. The author is asking questions but then making a conclusion that the kid isn't trans based on their own interpretation of studies. While the author might have a point about the importance of professional diagnosis, the way they framed it could be harmful. Telling someone their identity isn't valid based on their age and lack of professional consultation could be seen as dismissive and invalidating, especially in a vulnerable population like teenagers.\n\nAlso, the author cited statistics about the likelihood of gender dysphoria persisting after puberty. However, using such statistics in a public forum to invalidate someone's self-identification might not be appropriate. It's possible that the author is conflating self-identification with a clinical diagnosis, which can be a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intention was to encourage the kid to seek professional help, the tone and public nature of the comments might have come across as cruel or judgmental, leading to the moderation action.\n\nAnother angle: the server might have community guidelines that protect against discrimination or harassment, even if the author's intent wasn't malicious. Calling someone out in a group chat and making a public declaration about their identity could be seen as a violation of those rules, especially if it leads to a hostile environment. The mods might have acted to prevent further conflict and protect the well-being of the community members.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're providing a responsible perspective by raising awareness about the importance of proper diagnosis. But in this case, the approach seems to have been more about public shaming than offering private, supportive guidance. The question is whether challenging someone's identity in that manner is acceptable, even if rooted in concern.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be perceived as harmful and disrespectful, which might justify the ban. The key issue is the method and tone used, which likely contributed to the community feeling that the author was being exclusionary, hence labeling them a homophobe.\n"
