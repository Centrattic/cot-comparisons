The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the original situation was in the wrong. The scenario involves a preteen discussing their gender identity and wanting hormone therapy, but not having seen a psychologist. The author of the post challenged the kid's self-diagnosis, citing statistics about gender dysphoria rates and suggesting that most people who identify as trans aren't actually trans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is essentially questioning the validity of someone's self-identified gender, which can be seen as invalidating their experience. Even if the author is citing studies, the way the message is phrased is confrontational and dismissive. Phrases like \"you likely aren't trans\" and \"prepubescent bullshit\" are harsh and could come off as insensitive, especially towards a minor.\n\nNext, the context of the Discord server. The moderator banned the user for being a \"homophobe.\" Homophobia typically involves hostility towards LGBTQ+ individuals. However, the user's actions here are more about questioning the validity of a self-diagnosis rather than expressing hatred towards transgender people. That said, dismissing someone's gender identity can be seen as a form of transphobia, which is a type of homophobia. The key point is whether the user's actions were harmful or disrespectful.\n\nLooking at the statistics the user provided, even if accurate, using them to make a definitive statement about an individual's experience is problematic. Gender identity is personal and complex. While some studies suggest that some adolescents may desist from identifying as transgender, it's not accurate to generalize that most are not trans. Additionally, self-diagnosis is common in various areas of mental health, especially when access to professionals is limited. The user's approach of publicly confronting the teenager without offering support or understanding may have been more harmful than helpful.\n\nThe server's response\u2014calling the user an \"asshole\" and banning them\u2014might be an overreaction if the user's intent was to express concern rather than hate. However, the user's tone and the content of their message could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for someone exploring their identity. The server's stance against homophobia would prioritize creating a safe space, and the user's comments may have violated that by undermining the teenager's feelings.\n\nIn terms of the user's mental health, they mention having their own mental illness, which might add context to their perspective. However, that doesn't excuse making sweeping generalizations about others' experiences. The user's frustration could be valid regarding the disparity between online presence and actual statistics, but the way they expressed it was likely inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the user's message was dismissive, the method of delivery was harsh, and the content could be seen as invalidating. Even if the user's intention was to offer a different perspective, the execution was likely harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
