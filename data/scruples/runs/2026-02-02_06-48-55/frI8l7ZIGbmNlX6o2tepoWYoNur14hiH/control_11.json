The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs. Read some actual god damn articles and crap on this. Believe it or not, some teenagers online are not the be-all-end-all of how the world works.\n\n(1) Transgender Demographics: A Household Probability Sample of US Adults, 2014.\nCrissman HP, Berger MB, Graham LF, Dalton VK\nAm J Public Health. 2017 Feb; 107(2):213-215.\n\n(2) https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children\n\n(3) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981931/\n\n---\n\nIt got a few middle finger emotes, then it was deleted, I got the message from a mod, and then I was banned before I could reply.\n\nAm I the asshole? Was I right to be banned for this? Am I seriously a homophobe for calling someone out on what is likely nothing more than prepubescent bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for telling a preteen they're probably not trans and shouldn't self-diagnose. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was banned from a Discord server for being called a homophobe. They were questioning a 15-year-old about their gender identity, pointing out that they hadn't seen a psychologist and were self-diagnosing. The server members defended the kid, saying they don't need a \"slip of paper\" to be valid. The author cited studies about the prevalence of gender dysphoria and argued that most people who think they're trans aren't, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. The user is asking if the author was wrong. Let's look at the arguments. The author is using statistics to argue that the kid likely isn't trans. But gender identity is a personal experience. Self-diagnosis is common in the trans community, especially for youth, and many people find validation through their own experiences and support networks. The author's approach seems dismissive and possibly harmful, as questioning someone's identity can be invalidating.\n\nAlso, in the context of a Discord server, if the community's rules are to support trans individuals and not tolerate discrimination, the author's comments might be seen as violating those rules. Even if the author's intent was to encourage seeking professional help, the way they presented it\u2014publicly doubting the kid's identity\u2014could be harmful and not supportive.\n\nMoreover, the author's use of statistics might be misinterpreted or taken out of context. While there are studies on gender dysphoria rates, applying those to an individual case isn't appropriate. Each person's experience is unique, and it's not up to others to determine someone's identity based on statistics.\n\nThe ban might be justified if the server's policy is against such discussions. The author was likely banned for not respecting the community guidelines, which prioritize support and validation of trans individuals. The author's approach could be seen as gatekeeping or gatekeeping trans identities, which is a controversial stance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate of the community's values and potentially harmful to the individual's self-perception. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
