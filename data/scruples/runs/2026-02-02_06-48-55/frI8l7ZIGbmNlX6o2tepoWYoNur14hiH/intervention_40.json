The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was banned from a Discord server for telling a 15-year-old they probably aren't trans and shouldn't self-diagnose. The author cited some statistics about gender dysphoria rates and argued that many kids might be confusing other issues with dysphoria.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in question is a preteen, 15 years old. They're talking about wanting hormone therapy, which is a significant medical decision. The author questions their self-diagnosis and suggests they haven't seen a psychologist. The server's mods banned the author as a homophobe.\n\nThe key points here are: Is it appropriate to question someone's self-identified gender, especially a minor? The author uses statistics to argue that many people who identify as trans might not actually have gender dysphoria. But how is this being applied here?\n\nThe author is directly telling the teenager they're likely not trans, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if there's a statistical argument, it's possible that the author is generalizing and not considering the individual's experience. Also, the server's reaction suggests that the community values supporting the kid's self-identification, regardless of statistics.\n\nLegally, questioning someone's gender identity isn't a crime, but in the context of the server's rules against homophobia, the author's comments might be viewed as discriminatory. The mods might see the author as invalidating the kid's identity, which is considered harmful in many LGBTQ+ spaces.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach comes off as confrontational. Instead of offering support, they're making a public assessment that the kid isn't trans. This could be harmful, especially to a minor who is already seeking validation. Even if the author's intent is to protect the kid from medical decisions, the method of publicly challenging their identity might be more damaging.\n\nThe author also mentions their own mental health condition to compare, but that might not be relevant here. It's possible they're projecting their own experiences onto the situation, not fully understanding the nuances of gender dysphoria.\n\nIn terms of the statistics cited, the author's sources are from 2014 and a 2017 study. The field of transgender health is evolving, and recent data might show different percentages. Also, the author's interpretation that most people self-diagnosing aren't trans could be an oversimplification. There are cases where people correctly identify as trans without formal diagnosis, especially since the diagnostic process can be difficult to access.\n\nThe mod's response was to ban the author for being a homophobe. Whether that's fair depends on the server's policies. If the server prioritizes respecting self-identified gender, then the author's comments, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as violating those norms. The author's tone and directness likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect the kid from possible misdiagnosis, the approach is problematic. Publicly invalidating someone's identity, especially a minor, can be harmful. The server's community might value affirmation over questioning, making the author's actions a breach of their rules. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
