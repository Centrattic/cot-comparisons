The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for telling a preteen that they're likely not trans and shouldn't self-diagnose. The key points here are the context of the situation and the potential impact of the author's statements.\n\nFirst, the author was in a Discord server where a 15-year-old was discussing their desire for hormone therapy without seeing a psychologist. The author questioned the kid's self-diagnosis, citing statistics about gender dysphoria prevalence and the likelihood of it being transient. The server members and mods reacted negatively, leading to a ban for being a \"homophobe.\"\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author was wrong. The main issue is whether it's appropriate to question someone's self-identified gender, especially a minor, in a community setting. The author provided some references to studies, but the way they presented the information might have been dismissive. Phrases like \"most people who say they are trans, simply are not\" could be seen as invalidating the kid's feelings, regardless of the data behind it.\n\nSupporting someone's self-identity is crucial, especially for minors who might be exploring their gender. Even if the author's intent was to encourage professional consultation, the manner of delivery might have come across as harsh and judgmental. The server's reaction suggests they viewed the author's comments as harmful, which aligns with the idea that questioning someone's identity in a derogatory or condescending way can be considered transphobic.\n\nAdditionally, the author was in a position where they didn't have the full context of the kid's experiences. Without knowing the kid's history or the specific circumstances, making a judgment based on statistics might overlook individual cases. The ban, while possibly heavy-handed, reflects the community's stance on supporting self-identified trans individuals.\n\nSo, even if there's a debate about the accuracy of the statistics or the approach, the act of publicly calling out a minor's self-diagnosis in a way that could be perceived as dismissive or harmful might place the author in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
