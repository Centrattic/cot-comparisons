The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs. Read some actual god damn articles and crap on this.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them being banned from a Discord server for questioning a preteen's self-diagnosis of being trans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a preteen (15 years old) who hasn't seen a psychologist but feels trans. The poster questions their identity, citing statistics about gender dysphoria rates and suggesting the kid likely isn't trans. The server members reacted negatively, calling the poster an asshole, leading to a ban for being a \"homophobe.\"\n\nI should think about the context. The user is young and possibly dealing with identity issues. Self-diagnosis is common in youth, especially with access to online communities. The poster's approach seems confrontational and dismissive, using statistics to invalidate the kid's feelings. Even if the statistics are accurate, the way they're presented could be harmful.\n\nThe poster's argument is based on data, but they're applying it in a way that might not consider the individual's experience. Mental health and gender identity are complex; just because someone hasn't been diagnosed doesn't mean their feelings are invalid. The poster's message might come off as judgmental, which can be hurtful, especially to a teenager in distress.\n\nAlso, the server's response\u2014banning the poster for being a homophobe\u2014might be a reaction to the dismissive tone. Even if the poster's intent was to express concern, the method of delivery could be seen as invalidating. Supporting someone's identity is crucial, especially in online spaces where they might not have much support elsewhere.\n\nI need to check if the poster's statements have merit. While they reference studies, using such statistics to declare someone \"likely isn't trans\" is problematic. It's possible the server values affirming the child's feelings, regardless of statistical likelihood. The poster's approach might be seen as harmful, promoting self-diagnosis as \"prepubescent bullshit,\" which could discourage seeking professional help.\n\nIn conclusion, while the poster might have factual data, their approach and tone likely contributed to being banned. Invalidating someone's identity, especially a minor, can be hurtful. The answer leans towards the poster being in the wrong because the method of questioning was likely too harsh and dismissive.\n"
