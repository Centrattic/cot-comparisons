The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they got banned from a Discord server for questioning a 15-year-old's self-identification as trans, right? The user is asking if they were wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is saying that the teenager hasn't seen a psychologist and is self-diagnosing based on feeling trans. The author then shares statistics about how rare gender dysphoria is and suggests that the kid is likely not trans. The response from the server was negative, calling them an asshole and getting them banned as a homophobe.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's main points are based on statistics from academic sources about the prevalence of gender dysphoria. They argue that most people with gender dysphoria are not trans, especially if they haven't gone through puberty. The author is concerned about the kid making a big decision (hormone therapy) without professional consultation. However, the way they presented this was in a public server, questioning the kid in front of others and making a public statement that the kid \"likely isn't trans.\"\n\nOn the other side, the server members and moderator reacted strongly against the author. They might view the author's comments as invalidating the kid's identity and as transphobic, even if the author's intent was to caution. The term \"homophobe\" was used, but the issue here is about transphobia. The key point is whether questioning someone's self-diagnosis in a public forum without supporting the person's emotional well-being is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author is using data to support their claim, but how that data is applied matters. For example, stating that 1% or less have gender dysphoria could be misinterpreted as saying most people who identify as trans are not actually dysphoric. However, the data might be about clinical diagnoses versus self-identification. The author's conclusion that the kid is \"likely not trans\" could be seen as making a medical judgment without the proper authority.\n\nAnother angle is the approach taken. The author publicly called out the teenager, which might have been hurtful and not supportive. Even if the author had valid concerns, the way they addressed it in a group setting could be seen as bullying or not respecting the kid's privacy and feelings. The server's response of being an \"asshole\" and banning the author suggests that the community values supporting the individual's self-identity, even if there's uncertainty.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions their own mental health condition as a comparison, but that might not be directly relevant. Comparing one's experience with their own rare condition to gender dysphoria could oversimplify a complex issue. Mental health is nuanced, and self-diagnosis is a topic that's debated in many areas, but in the context of a teenager's identity, it's sensitive.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The answer hinges on whether their public criticism and conclusion that the kid isn't trans is appropriate. While the author's intent might have been to prevent the kid from making a decision based on incomplete information, the method and public nature of the critique could be considered harmful. Supporting someone's identity, even if there's doubt, is often seen as more compassionate, especially in online communities where people might be seeking validation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for invalidating someone's identity publicly and making a judgment without the necessary expertise or context. The answer would likely be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their approach was dismissive and potentially damaging, even if they had statistical references. The server's community likely prioritizes being inclusive and supportive rather than questioning someone's identity in that way.\n"
