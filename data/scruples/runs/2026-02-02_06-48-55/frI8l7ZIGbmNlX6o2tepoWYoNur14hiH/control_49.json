The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs. Read some actual god damn articles and crap on this. Believe it or not, some teenagers online are not the be-all-end-all of how the world works.\n\n(1) Transgender Demographics: A Household Probability Sample of US Adults, 2014.\nCrissman HP, Berger MB, Graham LF, Dalton VK\nAm J Public Health. 2017 Feb; 107(2):213-215.\n\n(2) https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children\n\n(3) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981931/\n\n---\n\nIt got a few middle finger emotes, then it was deleted, I got the message from a mod, and then I was banned before I could reply.\n\nAm I the asshole? Was I right to be banned for this? Am I seriously a homophobe for calling someone out on what is likely nothing more than prepubescent bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author was banned from a Discord server for questioning a 15-year-old's self-identification as trans, arguing that they likely aren't trans based on statistics about gender dysphoria and mental health. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person reached out to the kid, asking questions about their identity and treatment, which led to backlash in the server. The author's main points are based on statistical data suggesting that a small percentage of people actually experience gender dysphoria and that most cases resolve after puberty. They also mention that many people might confuse other issues with dysphoria.\n\nNow, the key issues here are self-diagnosis, the appropriateness of the author's approach, and the potential harm caused by questioning someone's identity. The server's moderators labeled the author as a \"homophobe,\" but the author claims they're not; they're concerned about the kid's well-being.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while it's true that self-diagnosis can sometimes miss underlying issues, it's also important to respect an individual's self-identified gender. The American Psychological Association emphasizes the importance of respecting a person's gender identity. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful, especially to a teenager who's already struggling. Even if the author's intentions were to encourage professional help, the way they framed it\u2014publicly calling the kid a \"false self-diagnosis\" and suggesting they \"likely aren't trans\"\u2014could be very damaging.\n\nAdditionally, the server's community guidelines might prioritize inclusivity and support over critical questioning, which led to the ban. The author's use of statistics without context could be seen as using data to invalidate someone's experience rather than supporting them. The line between concern and transphobia can be thin here. Even if the author isn't intentionally transphobic, their actions may have inadvertently caused harm by undermining the kid's feelings.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's approach was likely inappropriate. They should have encouraged the kid to seek professional help instead of publicly questioning their identity. The ban might be a result of the community's stance on supporting gender identity, even if the author had good intentions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
