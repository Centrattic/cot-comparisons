The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author posted on a Discord server about a preteen (15 years old) who's trying to get hormone therapy for being trans. The author questions the kid's self-diagnosis, pointing out that they haven't seen a psychologist and just \"feel\" they're trans. The author cites some statistics about gender dysphoria prevalence and argues that most kids who think they're trans aren't actually trans and might outgrow it. The server members responded negatively, calling the author an asshole, and the author got banned for \"homophobia.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is leaning towards thinking the author is wrong but wants to verify.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of questioning someone's identity. Trans people's experiences are valid, and self-diagnosis isn't uncommon due to lack of access to healthcare. However, the author is specifically concerned about a minor and their access to medical treatment. The author is trying to advise caution, citing studies.\n\nBut how is the author's approach? They're making a generalization that the kid \"likely isn't trans\" based on statistics, which might not be appropriate. It's possible that the author is invalidating the kid's feelings, which can be harmful. Even if the author's intent is to protect the kid from irreversible decisions, the way they're approaching it by publically questioning the kid's identity and using statistics might be seen as dismissive or transphobic.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that most people who identify as trans aren't actually trans because of low prevalence numbers is a point of contention. Different studies have varying results, and the author's interpretation might not account for changes in societal awareness affecting self-identification rates. Plus, suggesting that a significant number of trans kids outgrow their dysphoria could be reassuring to some but might also be used to pathologize trans identities.\n\nThe server's response was to ban the author for homophobia. Whether that's justified depends on if the author's statements crossed into derogatory or harmful territory. Even if the author is concerned about the kid's well-being, making such a definitive statement without medical expertise and in a public forum could be seen as harmful, especially since the kid is vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about a minor making a life-changing decision without professional guidance is understandable. However, the approach taken here was to publicly question the kid's identity rather than offer support or encourage professional consultation. That might be where the line is crossed.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respect for personal identity is crucial. While there's a valid debate about the medical implications of transitioning, the author's public invalidation of the kid's experience and the use of statistics to dismiss their identity could contribute to transphobia. The author's statement that the kid \"likely isn't trans\" is a strong claim that could be harmful, regardless of the intent.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their concern is about the kid's well-being. The way they expressed their concern was dismissive and potentially harmful, contributing to a hostile environment. The server's reaction, while possibly heavy-handed (a ban without a warning?), was a response to perceived homophobia, which the author's statements might have provoked by invalidating a trans person's identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
