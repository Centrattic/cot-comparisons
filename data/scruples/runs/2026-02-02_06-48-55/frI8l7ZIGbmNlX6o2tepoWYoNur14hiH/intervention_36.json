The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the \u201creal number\u201d being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria \u2013 and therefore Trans people \u2013 to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play \u2013 and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted theAITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a preteen who's considering hormone therapy without seeing a psychologist, and the author is questioning their self-diagnosis as trans. The author cites some stats about gender dysphoria prevalence and argues that most people who self-diagnose aren't actually trans. The person got banned from a Discord server for being a \"homophobe.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is challenging a minor's self-diagnosis, which can be sensitive. Self-diagnosis in mental health can be tricky, but when it's about a teenager's identity, it's a big deal. The author cites studies, but the context here is a Discord server where the discussion is happening, not a medical setting. \n\nThe author's comments might be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful. Even if they're using statistics, the way they're presenting it could invalidate the kid's feelings. The term \"prepubescent bullshit\" is particularly harsh. The server's mods banned them for being a homophobe, which relates to hate speech or discrimination. The author's intent was to question the validity of the trans identity, which could be perceived as transphobic.\n\nBut the author might argue they're advocating for the kid's well-being, suggesting that hormone therapy is a serious decision that requires professional evaluation. However, the approach taken\u2014publicly calling out the kid and making a definitive statement that they \"likely aren't trans\"\u2014could be harmful. It's possible that the server is a safe space for LGBTQ+ youth, and the author's comments broke the community guidelines by promoting harmful stereotypes or attacking someone's identity.\n\nAlso, the stats cited: while the numbers about gender dysphoria prevalence are from studies, interpreting them to claim that most people who identify as trans aren't might be a misrepresentation. The author's conclusion that the kid is \"falsely self-diagnosing\" is a strong assertion without medical expertise. The author isn't a professional, yet they're making a judgment that could impact the kid's self-perception and mental health.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's comments, though possibly intended to caution against hasty decisions, come across as dismissive and potentially harmful. The server's response to ban them for homophobia might be due to the hostile environment created by the author's message, even if the intent was not malicious. The key issue is whether questioning someone's identity in such a direct and public manner, especially towards a minor, violates the community's standards of respect and safety.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). They overstepped by making a definitive statement about the kid's identity, used harsh language, and contributed to a hostile environment, which aligns with being in the wrong in the AITA context.\n"
