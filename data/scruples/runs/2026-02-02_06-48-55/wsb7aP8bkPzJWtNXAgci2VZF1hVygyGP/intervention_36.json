My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are divorcing. The dad cheated on the mom with a younger grad student. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of depression and anger. After the affair, when the mom was hospitalized, the dad broke things off. Now, the mom is being difficult in the divorce, making false accusations, involving law enforcement, and harassing the dad. The mom is also trying to push the daughter to take her side, giving her letters to deliver and making negative comments. The dad is trying to be respectful and wants the divorce to be finalized, offering to give up everything. The daughter, who's about to graduate high school, is taking the dad's side.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for taking the dad's side. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the details given.\n\nSo, should the daughter take her dad's side? Well, the dad admitted he cheated. But he also apologized and tried to reconcile, then ended the affair. The mom has mental health issues and is acting out, making things worse. The mom is trying to manipulate the daughter to take her side. The dad is encouraging the daughter to be respectful to the mom, which is a positive action.\n\nFrom the daughter's perspective, she might feel closer to the dad because he's more stable, working towards his career, and her mom is emotionally unstable. The mom's behavior is toxic and manipulative, which could push the daughter to support the dad. However, the dad did commit adultery, which is a betrayal. But the daughter might be taking his side because the mom is the one being more abusive and unreasonable.\n\nThe question is whether taking the dad's side is wrong. The dad did wrong initially, but the mom's ongoing toxic behavior might justify the daughter's support for the dad. The daughter isn't excusing the dad's cheating but is choosing to side with the one who's more stable and is trying to end the toxic relationship. \n\nIn many cases, people take sides based on who is more emotionally healthy, even if both have faults. The daughter isn't in the wrong for supporting the parent who is trying to make amends and avoid further conflict, especially when the other parent is actively causing more harm. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the dad's remorse and the mom's manipulation and abuse, which make the daughter's support reasonable.\n"
