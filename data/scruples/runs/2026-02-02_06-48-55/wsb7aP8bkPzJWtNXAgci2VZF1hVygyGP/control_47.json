My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. Let me start by understanding the situation more clearly.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school. Her parents are both 35, got her when they were teenagers. The dad pursued his PhD and became a professor. The mom has mental health issues, sometimes being morbidly obese and angry. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student when she was in the mental institution. Then the dad broke it off after she came out, but the mom found out and things got really messy. The dad is trying to get the divorce finalized, offering everything, but the mom is holding out, using deputies, harassment, etc. The dad tells the author to be respectful to the mom, but the mom forces the author to deliver harsh letters to the dad and sides against him. The author takes her dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's regret. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side despite his cheating. \n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered a betrayal, which is a red flag. However, the context here is important. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital for severe depression, which might have been a vulnerable time. Also, the mom has a history of mental health issues, including being abusive towards the author. The dad is trying to reconcile and has admitted fault. The mom is the one escalating the conflict, using legal and emotional tactics to make it hard on the dad. \n\nThe author is caught between parents who are both acting poorly, but the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is using emotional and sometimes legal manipulation. The author is taking her dad's side because he acknowledged his wrongdoing and the mom is being abusive and manipulative. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, taking sides isn't necessarily wrong if one parent is clearly acting out. The dad's cheating is a mistake, but the mom's behavior is more harmful and ongoing. The author is supporting the parent who is trying to take responsibility and move forward, while the other parent is being toxic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she's supporting the parent who is trying to do better despite his past mistake, while the other parent is actively being harmful. The answer should be B, not an asshole.\n"
