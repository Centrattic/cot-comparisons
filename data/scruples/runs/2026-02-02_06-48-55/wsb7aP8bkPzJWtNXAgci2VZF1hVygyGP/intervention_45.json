My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a kid taking their dad's side in a divorce even though the dad cheated. The parents are both 35, the person is 18, female. The dad was a young parent, got a PhD, became a professor. The mom had mental health issues, sometimes abusive. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital, then broke it off. The mom is now acting out, trying to ruin the dad. Mom is asking the author to take her side, giving her letters to deliver, etc. The author feels dad's side because of how the mom has been acting.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what AITA (Am I the Asshole) is. It's a subreddit where people ask if they're in the wrong in a given situation. The key is to look at the facts and see if the person's actions are justifiable.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side, even though he cheated. The question is whether that makes them an asshole. The dad cheated, which is a big deal. However, the mom has been a difficult parent, with mental health issues, and has been acting out post-divorce in extreme ways. The author is caught in the middle, and the mom is pressuring her to take her side, which she's not doing. The dad is being cooperative, offering to give her everything to sign the papers, while the mom is being vindictive.\n\nIs the author wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, the dad did cheat, which is a serious fault. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic. The author is 18, graduating high school, which is a significant achievement. She's trying to navigate a tough situation where both parents have flaws. The question is whether taking the side of the parent who wronged the other by cheating is justifiable when the other parent is being abusive.\n\nIn many cases, people take sides based on which parent they see as more at fault or more abusive. Here, the dad admitted fault and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is being vindictive. The author might feel that the dad's cheating was a mistake, but the mom's ongoing behavior is worse. However, the act of choosing a parent can be complicated. The author is not directly harming the mother by taking her father's side, but the mother is using the child as a messenger for negative things. The author is not participating in that, which might be seen as a positive. \n\nBut since the father cheated, the author's support could be seen as ignoring that wrongdoing. However, in the context of the mother's behavior, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not taking the mother's side when the father is the one who committed infidelity. But given the mother's actions, perhaps the author's decision is to support the parent who is trying to move on and not being vindictive. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who is being unreasonable. The mom is being extreme, using law enforcement in a questionable way, and is pressuring the child. The dad is owning up to his mistake and trying to resolve the issue. The author is caught between both, but her taking the dad's side could be seen as a way to avoid further conflict and support the parent who is being more reasonable post-cheating. \n\nBut the initial cheating is a factor. However, the author is not being asked if the dad is in the wrong for cheating but if she is in the wrong for taking his side. In family dynamics, taking a side is complex. The author is trying to protect herself from the mom's demands and is supporting the dad who is being cooperative. The mom is the one acting out, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for taking the dad's side when the mom is being unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because while the dad cheated, the mom's behavior is worse, and the author is supporting the parent who is trying to resolve the situation amicably.\n"
