My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are getting divorced after a complicated history. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad admitted his mistake and tried to reconcile, but the mom is acting out, making things difficult. The author is 18, about to graduate high school, and feels torn between both parents. The mom is emotionally unstable, has mental health issues, and is being hostile, even involving sheriff deputies. The dad is trying to be respectful and is offering to make things right to end the divorce quickly.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side because they see the mom as the one causing the ongoing conflict and the dad as wanting to move on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing the dad's side despite his infidelity.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the dad did cheat, which is a serious betrayal. The author might feel the mom's behavior is justified given the cheating. But the mom's actions are extreme and harmful. She's using the child as a messenger for hostile letters, and she's creating a toxic environment. The dad is trying to be conciliatory, taking responsibility for his actions, and wants to end the situation.\n\nThe author is caught in the middle, but it's a tough spot. The question is about whether taking the dad's side is the wrong choice. The author is human, and it's understandable to sympathize with the parent who seems to be making an effort and is being harmed by the other parent's actions. However, the dad's cheating is a significant factor. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they see the bigger picture of the mom's mental health issues and the dad's attempts to fix things. The author might not have all the context when the cheating happened, and now is dealing with the aftermath where the mom is being abusive.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't taking sides for the wrong reasons. They recognize the dad's mistake but see the mom's actions as more harmful. The dad is taking responsibility, while the mom is being manipulative. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing the parent who's trying to be reasonable. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
