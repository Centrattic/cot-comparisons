My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side during the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The author's dad cheated, but the mom has been acting out, even after the affair. The dad admitted fault and is trying to move on, while the mom is being hostile and trying to involve the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 18, about to graduate high school. Both parents have issues. The dad cheated, which is a big deal, but he took responsibility and is trying to make amends. The mom has mental health struggles, which might explain some of her behavior. She's been admitted to a mental institution and has extreme mood swings. The author is being pressured by both sides, but the mom is more aggressive in demanding the child take her side, even sending letters to the dad. The dad, on the other hand, advises respect.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side, which the user thinks is wrong. The question is whether that makes the author an asshole. But taking sides in a divorce is complicated, especially when a child is caught in the middle. The dad's infidelity is a flaw, but the mom's behavior is toxic. The author might feel closer to the dad because the mom is being more abusive in their interactions. \n\nIs the author wrong for choosing the dad's side? Well, the dad did cheat, but he owns up to it and is trying to resolve things. The mom is causing unnecessary conflict. The author isn't taking sides to be malicious but because the parent's behavior is worse. It's a tough situation. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to the mom's harshness. The dad's mistake is part of the past, while the mom's actions are ongoing and harmful. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
