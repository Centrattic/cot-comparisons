My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated, which is a big issue. But there's also a lot of context about the mom's mental health struggles, her behavior being abusive, and her actions during and after the divorce. The author is 18, about to graduate high school, and has been caught in the middle.\n\nThe dad admitted he cheated and is trying to move on, offering to settle everything. The mom, on the other hand, has been acting out, including false accusations and harassment. She's also been emotionally abusive to the author. The dad asks the author to be respectful to the mom, but the mom demands the author take her side.\n\nThe author feels torn but sides with the dad because they see the mom's behavior as abusive and the dad's past mistakes as understandable given the situation. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking the dad's side despite his infidelity.\n\nNow, considering typical perspectives on this kind of situation. Cheating is generally frowned upon, but if one parent is abusive or toxic, taking the other's side might be seen as justifiable. The author is trying to be neutral but is influenced by the mom's hostile behavior. The dad's acknowledgment of his mistake and efforts to resolve things could also play a role.\n\nIn terms of morality, people might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to the mom's toxic behavior. Others might say the dad cheated, so taking his side is wrong regardless. But given the complexity and the abuse from the mom, some might see the author's stance as reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether taking the dad's side is seen as excusing his cheating or as a response to the mom's worse behavior. Since the author acknowledges the dad's mistake but understands the context, and the mom's actions are more harmful, the community might side with the author not being the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
