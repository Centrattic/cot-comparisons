My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. That's a major point. The dad ended the affair, but the mom found out through snooping and it led to a nasty divorce. The mom has been emotionally unstable, sometimes abusive, and has made extreme actions like involving sheriff's deputies. The daughter has seen both sides: her dad's infidelity but also her mom's toxic behavior. The dad is trying to resolve things, even offering everything, while the mom is being vindictive. The daughter feels torn, but ends up taking her dad's side because she sees the mom's behavior as worse, even though her dad made a mistake. \n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nOn one hand, the dad cheated, which is a betrayal. But he admitted fault and is trying to make amends. The mom's behavior is extreme and harmful too. The daughter is in a tough spot, being pressured by both parents to take sides. She's told to be respectful to the mom but the mom is demanding her side. The daughter's reasoning is that the dad's infidelity was a reaction to the mom's toxic behavior and that the mom is being vindictive. \n\nBut is taking a side wrong? In family conflicts, taking sides can be complicated. The daughter is a minor, but she's 18 now. However, in a divorce, the child's well-being is important. If the daughter is taking her dad's side because she sees the mom as more harmful, maybe that's a natural response. However, the dad started the affair, which is a significant issue. \n\nBut the mom's actions are more about seeking revenge and causing harm. The daughter might be protecting her dad from someone who's actively trying to ruin his life. Also, the dad has acknowledged his mistake and is trying to resolve it, which shows accountability. The daughter's loyalty might be influenced by seeing her dad as the more proactive one in moving forward, while the mom is stuck in negativity.\n\nBut is she wrong for taking his side despite the affair? It's possible that the daughter is being influenced by the mom's more extreme behavior, even though the dad's cheating is the root cause. However, given the mom's actions, maybe the daughter is trying to avoid the more harmful parent. The question is whether siding with the dad invalidates the mom's pain. The daughter isn't taking his side to justify the cheating but because the mom's behavior is worse. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a gray area. The dad was unfaithful, but he took responsibility. The mom is acting out with malicious intent. The daughter is in a tough spot. The question is whether taking a side is inherently wrong. In some cases, children might feel pressured to take sides, and the wrongness depends on the context. Here, the daughter is aware of both parents' flaws and is choosing based on the lesser of two evils. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to navigate a complex situation where both parents have issues. Her dad admitted fault, and her mom is being vindictive. Taking her dad's side in this context isn't necessarily wrong, especially given the mom's harmful behavior.\n"
