My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter taking her dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dad cheated while the mom was in the hospital for severe depression. The dad ended the affair, but things got really messy when the mom found out. The mom's behavior after includes making up threats and involving the police, sending videos to his workplace. The dad is trying to settle the divorce but the mom is being difficult. The daughter is taking her dad's side, and the question is whether she's wrong for that.\n\nThe daughter is 18, about to graduate high school. She wasn't aware of the affair until after the divorce was announced. The dad told her about everything. The mom is actively trying to get the daughter to take her side, giving her letters to deliver and making negative comments. The daughter feels she's taking her dad's side because he admitted fault and is trying to move on, while the mom is being hostile.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, taking sides can be complex. The daughter isn't responsible for her parents' actions. However, the dad's affair is a significant betrayal, but he did end the affair and is taking responsibility. The mom's actions post affair seem more vindictive and manipulative. The daughter is caught in the middle. \n\nBut the question is if the daughter is in the wrong. The daughter isn't committing a wrong act per se; she's choosing a side in her parents' conflict. However, she's being manipulated by her mom to take her side. The daughter might be justified in supporting her dad because he admitted fault and is trying to resolve things. On the other hand, maybe she should be neutral, but the mom's behavior is worse. \n\nIn many cases, when one parent is being abusive or manipulative, the child isn't in the wrong for aligning with the other parent. However, the dad did cheat, so there's a nuance. But if the daughter is being forced to take a side, but she's not the one committing any wrongdoing. The daughter's actions aren't harmful; she's supporting her dad who's trying to end the marriage. The mom's behavior is more toxic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
