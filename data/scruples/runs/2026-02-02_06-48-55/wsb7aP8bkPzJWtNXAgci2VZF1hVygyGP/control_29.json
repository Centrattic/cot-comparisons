My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. Let me break down the story.\n\nFirst, the parents had a tough marriage. The dad went to get his PhD and became a professor, which sounds like a lot of dedication. The mom had mental health issues, sometimes being abusive and neglectful. The dad cheated with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. Then, when the mom found out, there was a messy divorce with her acting out, like involving deputies and harassing the dad. The author's dad is trying to move on, but the mom is making things hard, even making the daughter deliver mean letters. The author feels the dad is trying to do the right thing, despite his cheating, while the mom is being unreasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the dad.\n\nSo, the author is 18, which is a minor, and the parents are both adults. The key here is whether taking the dad's side makes the author an asshole. The dad did cheat, but the mom's behavior is also problematic. The author isn't taking sides in the legal sense but emotionally. The dad has acknowledged his mistake, which is important. The mom's actions seem vindictive and harmful. The author's support for the dad might be seen as justified if they believe he's trying to make things right, especially since the mom is being abusive and manipulative. \n\nBut wait, the dad cheated, so is the author automatically in the wrong? Well, cheating is wrong, but the context matters. The dad's cheating might have been a mistake, but the mom's actions post-divorce are worse. The author isn't defending the infidelity but is recognizing the dad's efforts and the mom's ongoing toxicity. The question is about taking sides, not about justifying the cheating. Since the author isn't excusing the dad's infidelity but is acknowledging the mom's harmful behavior, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, at 18, the child's emotional response is influenced by seeing the dad's remorse and the mom's manipulation. It's hard to blame the daughter for supporting the parent who's trying to move on while the other is being abusive. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is responding to a toxic situation and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake. The focus is on the current behavior of both parents, not just the past actions. The mom's actions are more harmful, so taking the dad's side could be seen as reasonable.\n"
