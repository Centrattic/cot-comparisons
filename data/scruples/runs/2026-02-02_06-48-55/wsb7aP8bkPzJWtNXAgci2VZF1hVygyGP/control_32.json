My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a teenager whose parents are divorcing because the dad cheated. The author is taking her dad's side even though he was the one who cheated. The mom has a history of mental health issues and has been acting out, including some extreme behavior during the divorce. The dad admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is being difficult. The author feels conflicted but can't help supporting the dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad did cheat, which is usually considered wrong. But he acknowledged his mistake and is trying to make things right. The mom has her own issues, including mental health problems, and has been abusive towards the dad and maybe even the author. The author is caught in the middle, with the dad asking her to be respectful and the mom pressuring her to take her side with hurtful tasks.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, when a parent is abusive or has mental health issues, it's not uncommon for the other parent to seek support. The author's dad did cheat, but he's trying to resolve it. The mom's behavior seems more toxic, even if the dad had a mistake. The author's choice might be influenced by wanting to avoid further conflict and seeing the dad's efforts to fix things. Also, the author is about to graduate high school, so maybe she's trying to find her own path without being dragged into parental drama.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should be impartial, but given the mom's behavior, it's understandable she leans towards the dad who is being more constructive. The dad's affair was a mistake, but the mom's actions are more harmful. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing the parent who is trying to move forward and being respectful to the other. The key points are the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake and the mom's toxic behavior. So, the answer is B.\n"
