My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated on the mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The parents married young, the dad went on to get his PhD and became a professor. The mom has mental health issues, including periods of depression, anger, and obesity. The dad cheated when the mom was hospitalized. The mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The dad is trying to reconcile, but the mom is being vindictive, involving the police, and sending the daughter letters to pass to her dad. The daughter feels torn and sides with her dad, leading to the question of whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's infidelity during a vulnerable time for the mom, the mom's subsequent hostile behavior, and the daughter's alignment with the dad. The question is whether the daughter is wrong for taking his side despite his cheating.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions of the person asking the question. Here, the daughter is taking her dad's side. But why is she doing that? The dad cheated, but the mom's behavior is also extreme and vindictive. The daughter is being pressured by the mom to take her side, and the dad is encouraging her to be respectful but not to take sides. The daughter feels her dad's side because of his efforts to move on and the mom's hostile actions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking sides in a parent's divorce is complex. The dad's cheating is a significant betrayal, but the mom's actions are equally harmful. The daughter is caught in the middle. The fact that the dad is being proactive in trying to resolve things and the mom is being vindictive might lead the daughter to side with the dad. However, the dad's initial cheating is a point against him. But the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking his side if she feels he's the one trying to move forward while the other parent is being toxic.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age and the context of her life (graduating high school), she might be trying to find stability. The dad's efforts to reconcile and the mom's abusive behavior could make the dad the more stable option in her eyes. While the dad did cheat, the mother's behavior is arguably worse, so the daughter's choice might be justified.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at both sides. Here, the daughter isn't doing anything directly wrong by choosing a parent; she's reacting to the circumstances. The real issue is the parents' behavior towards each other and her. Since the daughter is not the one causing the conflict but is a victim in the middle, she's not the asshole. The answer would be B, No.\n"
