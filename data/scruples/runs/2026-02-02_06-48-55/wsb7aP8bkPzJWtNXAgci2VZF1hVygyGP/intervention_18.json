My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side during the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the dad cheated on the mom. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression and obesity, and she was admitted to a mental institution. The dad had an affair with a grad student when the mom was institutionalized. After the mom was released, the dad broke things off with the student. However, the mom started acting out, leading to a contentious divorce. The dad is trying to settle things, while the mom is being hostile, even calling the police on him and spreading bad stuff. The author, the daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad tells her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom demands the daughter take her side. The daughter feels her dad's side is the right one and can't help but support him, hence asking if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if answer A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong) is correct.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Taking sides in a parent's divorce is a tough spot for a child. Both parents have flaws. The dad cheated, which is a big deal, but the mom's behavior is also toxic. The daughter is 18, about to graduate high school, so she's in a transition phase. \n\nThe question is whether the daughter is wrong for supporting her dad. The dad's cheating is a factor, but the daughter might not be responsible for that. She's not the one who committed the affair. The mom's actions are also problematic\u2014using the daughter to deliver hate letters, being abusive. The daughter is in a difficult position where both parents have issues.\n\nIn these situations, it's often considered normal for a child to take a parent's side, especially when one parent is being more abusive. The daughter is not the one who cheated; her dad did. Even though he's at fault for the affair, the mom's behavior is worse in terms of emotional abuse. The daughter might feel more empathy for the dad trying to escape the toxic situation. \n\nHowever, the daughter is taking her dad's side even though he cheated. Does that make her wrong? If a parent is unfaithful, the other parent has valid reasons for resentment. But in this case, the dad's affair occurred when the mom was in a mental health crisis. The daughter might not be faulted for taking the side of the parent who is trying to end a harmful situation. Also, the dad is being more reasonable in trying to settle the divorce, while the mom is being vindictive. The daughter's support could be seen as understanding the bigger picture, even if the dad had flaws.\n\nOn the flip side, the daughter isn't responsible for her father's actions. Taking his side might not be the right choice because he cheated. But considering the mom's behavior is more toxic, maybe the daughter isn't wrong. It's a complex situation where both parents have significant issues.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person acted unkindly or unreasonably. The daughter isn't doing anything wrong per se; she's choosing a side in a difficult family situation. The key point is that she's not the one who cheated. She's a teenager caught in a mess, and her feelings are valid. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for taking her dad's side given the circumstances.\n"
