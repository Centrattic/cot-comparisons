My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a teenager taking her dad's side during a divorce where the dad cheated. The parents are both 35, the author is 18. The dad got a PhD and is a professor. The mom has mental health issues, including depression and obesity, and she was admitted to a mental institution. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital, then broke it off later. After the mom was released, the divorce started, and the mom was really hostile, even involving the sheriff and sending videos to the dad's department head. The dad is trying to make things right, while the mom is acting out. The author feels conflicted but sides with the dad because of the mom's behavior.\n\nFirst, the dad did cheat, which is a major issue. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so the dad is at fault here. However, the mom has a history of mental health problems and has been abusive to the dad. The author's dad is taking responsibility and trying to make amends, while the mom is being vindictive and harmful. The author is caught in the middle, and both parents are pressuring her to take sides. The dad tells her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is aggressive and demands the author to take her side. The author is struggling with this and sides with the dad because of the mom's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the dad cheated, but the mom is also not blameless. The author is an adult now, about to graduate high school, so she's at an age where she can form her own opinions. The main question is whether taking the dad's side makes her an asshole. The dad admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is acting out. The author's side is influenced by the mom's hostile behavior. Since the dad acknowledged his wrongdoing and the mom is the one being abusive, the author's choice isn't necessarily wrong. But does taking sides in a divorce matter? It's a personal choice, and considering the circumstances, the author might not be wrong. However, maybe she should be neutral. But given the mom's treatment of the dad, it's understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
