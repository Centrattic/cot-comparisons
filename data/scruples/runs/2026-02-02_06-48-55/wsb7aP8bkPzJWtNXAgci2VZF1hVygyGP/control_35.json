My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is an 18-year-old girl whose parents are going through a divorce. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student, which happened around the time the mom was hospitalized for severe depression. The dad broke off the affair when the mom was released, but then the mom found out and the divorce process became really contentious. The mom is described as having mental health issues, being abusive and manipulative towards the dad, even involving law enforcement falsely. The dad is trying to move on and settle the divorce, while the mom is acting out, sending the daughter letters to deliver to the dad, and making the daughter take her side.\n\nThe author is taking her dad's side because she sees his cheating as a mistake but also recognizes the mom's toxic behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by supporting her dad despite his infidelity.\n\nFirst, the dad did cheat, which is a significant betrayal. However, the mom's actions post-divorce are also problematic and abusive. The daughter is caught in the middle, being manipulated by the mom. The dad has admitted fault and is trying to resolve things amicably, while the mom is acting out, which can be emotionally harmful to the daughter.\n\nIn terms of taking sides, the daughter is choosing her dad because she understands the context\u2014his cheating was partly due to the mom's instability and their difficult relationship. The daughter isn't defending the cheating but is prioritizing moving forward with her dad's efforts to end the toxic situation. The mom's demands for the daughter to take her side and deliver hostile messages add to the complexity.\n\nLegally and ethically, the daughter isn't responsible for her parents' actions. She's choosing to support the parent who is more cooperative and less abusive. The fact that the dad acknowledges his mistake and is trying to make things right, while the mom is being manipulative, might justify the daughter's perspective. However, the dad's cheating is a red flag. But given the mom's behavior, the daughter might feel that taking her side would mean enabling further abuse.\n\nSo, the key points are: dad cheated but takes responsibility, mom has mental health issues and is abusive. The daughter is navigating a toxic situation and choosing to side with the parent who is trying to resolve things. The answer might be B (not wrong) because the daughter is choosing to support the parent who is less harmful and more honest about the situation, even though the dad made a mistake. The mom's actions are more harmful in the long run, so the daughter's choice is understandable.\n"
