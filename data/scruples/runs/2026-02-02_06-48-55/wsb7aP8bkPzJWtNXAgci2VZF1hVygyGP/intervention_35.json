My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce despite his cheating. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. That's a big deal. The author knows this and acknowledges her dad's mistake. However, the mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of depression, anger, and even being admitted to a mental institution. The dad's affair happened around the time the mom was in the institution, but it wasn't caused by her absence. The dad ended the affair, and the mom discovered it through his phone, leading to a nasty divorce.\n\nThe mom is portrayed as being manipulative and malicious. She's trying to get the author to take her side, sending her letters to deliver to the dad and making hurtful statements. The dad, on the other hand, is trying to be respectful and wants to move on, even offering everything to finalize the divorce. The author feels conflicted but sides with her dad because of the mom's behavior and the dad's efforts to make amends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nIn many cases, when a parent is clearly at fault (like cheating), the natural instinct is to side with the wronged parent. But here, the mom's actions are also extreme\u2014harassment, false accusations, involving law enforcement. The author is in a tough spot, caught between two parents with significant flaws. The dad admitted his mistake and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is toxic and manipulative.\n\nThe author's decision is based on the dad's accountability and the mom's destructive behavior. It's not about justifying the affair but recognizing the mom's role in creating a hostile environment. The author isn't ignoring the dad's mistake but is taking into account the broader context of the mom's actions.\n\nIn such situations, it's common for children to side with the parent who is more emotionally stable and less toxic. The author isn't condoning the affair but is acknowledging the complexities. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing the parent who is being more responsible and respectful during the divorce process.\n"
