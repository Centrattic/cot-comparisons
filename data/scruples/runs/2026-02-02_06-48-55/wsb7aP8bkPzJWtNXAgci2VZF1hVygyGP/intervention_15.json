My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating. \n\nFirst, the background: Dad had an affair with a much younger grad student while the mom was in a mental institution. He ended the affair after the mom was released, but she found out and the divorce became contentious. The mom is described as having mental health issues, being abusive, and using extreme tactics like calling the sheriff to have him arrested. She also manipulates the author to take her side. The dad acknowledges his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is seen as the one causing ongoing conflict.\n\nThe author, an 18-year-old about to graduate high school, feels torn. The dad wants the author to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring the author to take her side. The author can't help but side with the dad because of the mom's behavior. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. The key points to consider are: the dad cheated, but the mom's actions were extremely harmful and manipulative. The author is a young adult, possibly not fully understanding the complexities. However, the dad admitted his mistake, while the mom is the one actively causing harm. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions of the person asking. The author's actions are siding with the dad, which could be seen as not respecting the mom's feelings. But given the mom's manipulative and harmful behavior, the author might have valid reasons. However, the dad cheated, so siding with him might be seen as ignoring that wrongdoing. But the context shows that the dad took responsibility, and the mom has been more toxic. \n\nIn many cases, AITA threads consider the emotional impact and the responsibility of the person in question. The author is in a difficult position, but taking sides might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the author is respecting the dad's accountability and the mom's toxic behavior, maybe not. But if they're ignoring the dad's infidelity, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the scenario also mentions the mom's extreme actions, which might justify the author's choice. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to the mom's manipulation and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author is not considering the dad's initial fault, then maybe A. But given the context, the author's choice is understandable.\n"
