My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is complicated. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The mom is described as having mental health issues, sometimes being abusive towards the dad. The dad seems remorseful and wants to end the marriage, while the mom is trying to make things hard, even using police when she wanted to reconcile and then sent videos to his department. The author, who's about to graduate high school, feels pressured by the mom to take her side but ends up supporting the dad.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated, so he's definitely at fault there. But the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's been abusive, has mental health issues, and is using manipulative tactics during the divorce. The author is caught in the middle, and the mom is actively trying to get the kid to take her side. The author feels that the dad's actions were understandable given the mom's behavior, and the dad is trying to make amends. \n\nThe question is if the author is wrong for taking the dad's side. Well, the dad cheated, but he's also the one trying to end the toxic situation. The mom is being abusive and manipulative. The author isn't taking sides in the sense of justifying the dad's cheating, but rather understanding the context. The dad is being more reasonable here. The author is in a tough spot, but supporting the parent who's trying to resolve the harmful situation might not be wrong. The mom's behavior is worse in many ways. The author isn't condoning the cheating but is taking into account the broader family dynamics. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
