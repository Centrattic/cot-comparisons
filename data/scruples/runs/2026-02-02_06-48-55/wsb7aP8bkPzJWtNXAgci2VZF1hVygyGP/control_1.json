My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad had an affair when the mom was in the hospital. The dad is a professor, tried to get his PhD, which might have added stress. The mom has mental health issues, including depression, and after the dad's affair, she was in a mental institution. Now, the dad is trying to get the divorce finalized, but the mom is causing problems, like involving the police and deputies. \n\nThe author, an 18-year-old daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad told her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pushing her to take her side and deliver harsh letters. The author feels the dad cheated and is eager to end the marriage, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative. The daughter can't help but take her dad's side.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, the dad did cheat, but the mom is clearly having mental health struggles and acting out. The daughter is under a lot of pressure from both parents. Taking sides in a parental divorce is complicated. The daughter isn't responsible for the parents' actions, but she's trying to navigate a difficult situation.\n\nThe key points here are that the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative. The daughter is caught between a parent who is at fault but also trying to be fair, and another parent who is mentally unstable and hostile. The daughter isn't taking sides out of malice but because she can see the dad's side and the mom's behavior is toxic. \n\nIn these situations, there's no clear right or wrong, but the daughter's decision here seems to be based on the reality of her parents' actions. The dad has taken responsibility, while the mom is acting out. The daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing the parent who is more reasonable post-divorce. So the answer is B.\n"
