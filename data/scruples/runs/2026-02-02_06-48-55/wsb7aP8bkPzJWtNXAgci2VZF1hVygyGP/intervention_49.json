My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's parents had a complicated relationship. The dad worked hard to get his PhD and became a professor. The mom has mental health issues, including depression and obesity, and was sometimes abusive towards the dad. Then, the dad cheated on the mom with a grad student while she was in a mental institution. The affair didn't cause her hospitalization, but he took advantage of her absence. When the mom found out about the affair, the divorce became really contentious. The dad offered to give up everything to get the divorce finalized, while the mom is being vindictive, involving the police, and trying to ruin his reputation.\n\nThe author, being 18 and about to graduate high school with honors, is caught in the middle. The dad told her to be respectful to the mom and not take sides, but the mom is forcing her to take her side by giving her letters to deliver and making negative comments about the dad. The author feels they can't help but take the dad's side given the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the dad's side. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the dad cheated, which is a betrayal. But he admitted his mistake and tried to move on. The mom's behavior is toxic, abusive, and vindictive, making the divorce process even more painful. The author is under a lot of pressure from both parents, but the mom is being more aggressive in pushing her to take her side.\n\nThe author is trying to navigate a very difficult situation. They're an adult now, about to graduate, and need to make their own decisions. Choosing to take the dad's side because the mom is being abusive and the dad has acknowledged his wrongdoing could be seen as self-preservation and choosing healthier dynamics. However, taking sides in a family conflict can be seen as unfair by others, especially if one parent is clearly at fault. But considering the mom's manipulative and abusive tactics, the author's choice might be more about protecting themselves and their dad from further harm.\n\nIn terms of ethics, taking sides in a family matter is a personal choice. The author isn't at fault for choosing to support the parent who has shown remorse and is trying to resolve things, especially when the other parent is being inconsiderate and harmful. The dad's actions were wrong, but he's taking responsibility. The mom's actions are more about retaliation and control, which might make the author's decision to side with the dad more understandable.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author might not be in the wrong. They're in a tough spot, but their choice is influenced by the mom's manipulative behavior and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistakes. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
