My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are getting divorced. The dad cheated on the mom by hooking up with a grad student, which happened around the time the mom was in a mental institution. The dad ended the affair and tried to stay committed after the mom recovered. The mom found out about the affair through his phone, leading to a nasty divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving the police, and trying to get the author to take her side by giving her nasty letters to deliver. The dad is being reasonable, telling the author to be respectful to the mom.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school, and has seen the mom's behavior as being very negative, even abusive. The dad is taking responsibility for cheating and is trying to move on. The author feels she can't help but take her dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are the actions of both parents. The dad cheated, but admitted fault and is trying to resolve the situation. The mom is acting out in a harmful, possibly abusive way, making false accusations, and manipulating the child into taking her side. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often considered problematic when a parent alienates the child against the other parent. If the dad is the one who cheated, but the mom is being abusive and manipulative, the child's loyalty might naturally go to the parent who is more stable and remorseful. However, the dad did cheat, which is a betrayal. But the mom's behavior seems more toxic.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's seeing the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's attempts to make amends. Taking her dad's side in this context, given the mom's actions, might be justified. However, there's a part of me that thinks she should try to stay neutral, but the situation is complex. The mom's behavior is clearly harmful, so maybe the author isn't wrong for taking her dad's side. So, Answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
