My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. So, first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school with honors. Her parents had her when they were teenagers. The dad got his PhD and is a professor. The mom has had severe mental health issues, including periods of depression, obesity, anger, and even being admitted to a mental institution. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student, which happened around the time the mom was in the hospital. After the mom got out, the dad ended the affair but the mom found out through his phone and the divorce became contentious. The mom is causing a lot of harassment, even involving the police falsely. The dad wants to end the marriage and is trying to be respectful, while the mom is pushing the author to take her side and even gives her letters to deliver to the dad.\n\nThe author feels she's taking her dad's side because he cheated, but he's the one trying to make things right. The mom is being manipulative and abusive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, the dad admitted fault, tried to make amends, and is trying to move on. The mom has a history of mental health issues, which might affect her behavior, but she's also being manipulative and abusive. The author is caught in the middle, and the dad is urging her to be respectful, while the mom is pressuring her to take sides. The author isn't taking sides out of blind loyalty but because she sees the dad's efforts and the mom's manipulative behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, taking a side in a parental conflict can be complex, but the key factors here are the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake and his desire to resolve things, versus the mom's ongoing harassment and manipulation. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's responding to the reality of the situation where one parent is being abusive and the other is trying to leave the cycle. There's no clear-cut answer, but the author's choice might be justified given the context. So, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing the parent who is being more reasonable and trying to end the harmful cycle.\n"
