My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side during the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The dad cheated, which is a major betrayal. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including hospitalization, and has been abusive and manipulative. The dad admitted fault and wants to move on, while the mom is using the divorce as a way to harass him. The author's dad is trying to handle it respectfully, even offering everything to get the divorce done. The mom is trying to manipulate the author to take her side, giving her tasks like delivering nasty letters. The author feels torn but sides with the dad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for taking the dad's side. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Well, in most cases, taking sides in a family conflict can be complicated. However, the dad did cheat, which is a serious issue. But the mom's behavior is also abusive and manipulative. The author might be trying to protect the dad from further harassment and also dealing with a parent who's not being supportive. \n\nI think it's important to consider that the author is 18, about to graduate high school, and dealing with this intense family conflict. The dad is honest about his mistakes and wants to move on, while the mom is acting out in revenge. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing the parent who is more stable and trying to do the right thing, even if that parent had a flaw (cheating). The author's judgment might be influenced by seeing the dad's remorse and the mom's toxic behavior. \n\nIn these situations, it's not just about who did what, but also about the current behavior and how each parent treats the child. The dad is encouraging respect and understanding, while the mom is trying to use the child as a weapon. So, taking the dad's side might be a way to protect their own well-being and support the parent who is trying to be reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
