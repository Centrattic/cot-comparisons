My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, being obese, angry, and even being admitted to a mental institution. The dad got a PhD and became a professor, while the mom seems to have struggled more. The affair happened when the mom was in the hospital, and the dad broke it off after she came out. The mom then started a nasty divorce, using deputies against the dad, and is trying to manipulate the author to take her side. The author is 18, about to graduate high school, and feels torn between the two.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side because the mom is being abusive and manipulative, even though the dad cheated. The question is whether taking the dad's side makes the author the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the dad cheated, which is morally wrong. But the mom is also being toxic and using the child as a weapon. The author is caught in the middle. Taking a side might be a natural reaction given the mom's behavior. \n\nBut the dad did cheat, so the author might be supporting someone who wronged their mother. However, the mom is also being abusive. The author isn't responsible for the dad's actions, but they are choosing a side in a parental conflict. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about taking responsibility. Since the author isn't the one who cheated or the one being abusive, maybe they aren't the asshole. They're a teenager caught in a terrible situation. Their choice might be influenced by the mom's manipulation and the dad's remorse. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author isn't at fault. They're choosing a side based on the circumstances presented, and it's understandable given the mom's behavior. But there's a part of me that thinks taking a side in a divorce might not be ideal, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the parent who cheated is the dad, but the mom is toxic, the author's choice isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
