My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is the asshole for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, about to graduate high school with honors. Her parents had her when they were teenagers. The dad got a PhD and became a professor, working hard. The mom had mental health issues, sometimes being abusive and neglectful. The dad cheated when the mom was hospitalized for depression. The dad ended the affair, but the mom found out, leading to a nasty divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, and trying to involve the police. The dad is trying to move on, but the mom is being manipulative, giving the author letters to deliver and demanding her to take her side. The author feels she's taking her dad's side because he's the one who's trying to resolve things and the mom is being cruel.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong for supporting her dad. The dad cheated, but he admitted it and is trying to make amends. The mom is the one being abusive, both to the dad and the author. The author is being pressured by the mom to take her side, but she's choosing her dad because he's trying to end the conflict and not being abusive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, cheating is definitely wrong, but the mom's behavior is equally, if not more, problematic. The author is caught in the middle. She's taking her dad's side not to support his infidelity but because the mom is being toxic. The dad is trying to move past the cheating, while the mom is acting out. The author is a minor, and her well-being is important. Taking her dad's side in this context might be her way of protecting herself from the mom's behavior.\n\nHowever, taking sides in a family conflict can be complicated. But given the circumstances, the dad's actions (cheating) are in the past, and he's taking responsibility. The mom is the ongoing source of conflict and toxicity. The author is not in the wrong for choosing to support the parent who is trying to be respectful and move forward, especially when the other parent is being abusive and manipulative.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
