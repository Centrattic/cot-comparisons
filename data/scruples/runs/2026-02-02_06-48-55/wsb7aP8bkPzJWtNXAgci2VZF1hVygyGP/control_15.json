My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated by being with a younger grad student while the mom was in a mental institution. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression and anger issues. After the affair was discovered, the divorce became very contentious. The mom is acting out, even involving the police in a threatening way. The dad is trying to move on, offering everything to make it work, but the mom is resisting and trying to get the daughter to take her side. The daughter is told by her dad to be respectful but ends up taking his side because she understands his reasons.\n\nThe question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here might be the dad's infidelity, the mom's mental health and behavior, and the daughter's position in the conflict. \n\nThe dad did cheat, which is a common reason people take sides against someone. But the mom's actions post-divorce are extreme, involving false accusations and harassment. The daughter is caught in the middle, with the dad being honest and the mom manipulating her. \n\nIn many such cases, people might argue that the daughter is not in the wrong if she sees her dad's actions as a response to the mom's instability and the mom's subsequent vindictiveness. The dad's cheating is a flaw, but the mom's behavior after could make the daughter sympathize more with the dad. Also, the dad is honest about his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is using the daughter against him. \n\nHowever, some might say that the daughter is still wrong for taking her dad's side because he cheated. But in the context of the entire situation, especially the mom's actions post-divorce, it's understandable. The daughter might feel that her dad is trying to be fair, while the mom is being irrational. \n\nSo considering both sides, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's responding to the complex dynamics and the mom's behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
