My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The parents are both 35, the kid is 18. The dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues, being abusive, and causing problems. The dad is trying to move on, while the mom is being vindictive. The kid is caught in the middle, taking the dad's side because they see the mom's behavior as worse.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. First, the dad did cheat, which is a significant wrongdoing. However, the mom's behavior is also harmful and manipulative. The author is taking the dad's side because the mom is acting worse, even though he was the one who cheated. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents are at fault in different ways. The dad's infidelity is a major betrayal, but the mom's ongoing mental health struggles and abusive tendencies might mitigate her responsibility, but that's debatable. The child is in a tough spot, and their perspective is influenced by seeing the dad's attempts to reconcile and the mom's vindictiveness. \n\nHowever, the dad is the one who initially cheated. The child might not be in the wrong for taking the side of the parent who is more cooperative and less harmful now, even if they were the one who made the mistake. The key is whether the child is being unfair by not holding the dad accountable for his actions, despite the mom's poor behavior.\n\nAlternatively, the child could be justified in taking the dad's side because the mom's actions are more harmful. But in terms of moral responsibility, the dad did the cheating, which is a clear transgression. So maybe the child is in the wrong for not acknowledging their dad's mistake and instead aligning with him despite it. But the situation is complex because both parents have flaws. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether taking one's side is wrong regardless of the circumstances. If the child is aware of the dad's cheating and still sides with him, perhaps they're not in the wrong because they're prioritizing the parent who's acting more constructively. But if the cheating is a major factor, then maybe the child should be more neutral. However, the post shows the dad has acknowledged his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is being malicious. \n\nIn some cases, people take sides based on current behavior rather than past mistakes. The child's choice might be based on seeing the dad's remorse and the mom's ongoing issues. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the cheating is a big deal, then maybe they are. It's a tough call. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the child is in a difficult situation and the dad is taking responsibility, while the mom is being the aggressor now. The child taking the dad's side could be seen as a way to seek stability and avoid more conflict.\n"
