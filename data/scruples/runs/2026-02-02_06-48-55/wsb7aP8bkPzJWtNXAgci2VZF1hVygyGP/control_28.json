My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the parents had a tough relationship. The dad was a young parent but worked hard to get his PhD and became a professor. The mom had mental health issues, including depression, and sometimes was abusive towards the dad. The dad cheated by starting a relationship with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. Then when the mom found out, there was a messy divorce with her acting out, like calling the police on the dad, sending videos to his employer, etc.\n\nThe author is 18, female, graduating high school. She wasn't aware of the affair until after the divorce was announced. Her dad admitted his mistake and tried to settle things, while the mom is being difficult. The mom is making the daughter deliver harsh letters to the dad and demands her to take her side. The daughter can't help but take her dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the dad cheated, which is a big deal. But the mom has mental health issues and is retaliating in harmful ways. The daughter is caught in the middle, pressured by both parents. The dad is being honest and taking responsibility, and the mom is being abusive and manipulative. The daughter is trying to stay respectful but is forced to take sides because of the mom's demands.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is being manipulated or abused into taking a side, it's not necessarily their fault. The dad's infidelity is wrong, but the mom's behavior is also problematic. The daughter isn't choosing based on the infidelity alone but because the mom is acting out destructively. Taking sides in a divorce is common, especially when one parent is being unreasonable. The daughter is also an adult now, graduating high school, so she's transitioning into adulthood. Her choice to support the dad, given the circumstances, might be justified as self-preservation and supporting the parent who is being honest and trying to resolve things.\n\nSo, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is messy, and the daughter is reacting to the mom's toxic behavior. The dad's mistake isn't being ignored, but the mom's actions are making it hard to support her. The daughter isn't being unfair; she's choosing the parent who is being truthful and not abusive.\n"
