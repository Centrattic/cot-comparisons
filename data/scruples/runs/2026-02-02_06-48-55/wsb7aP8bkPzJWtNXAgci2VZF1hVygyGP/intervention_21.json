My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation they described. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated, which led to a messy divorce. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including hospitalizations and extreme moods. The dad is a professor who worked hard to get his PhD. The cheating happened when the mom was in the hospital, so the dad took advantage of her vulnerable state. Then after she got out, he ended the affair, but things still went south. The mom is now being aggressive and trying to ruin the dad's life, even involving the police in a dramatic way. She's also pressuring the kid to take her side, giving her letters to deliver, and making hurtful statements.\n\nThe author, who's 18 and close to graduating high school, feels torn. The dad has been honest and respectful, asking the kid to be kind to the mom. The mom, however, is being hostile and manipulative. The author can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether taking the dad's side makes the author the asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to see what I think. \n\nWell, taking sides in a parental conflict is complicated. The dad did cheat, which is wrong, but the mom's behavior in the divorce is even more extreme and vindictive. The author is in a tough spot because they're being pushed by the mom to take her side, which is manipulative. The dad, even though he made a mistake, is trying to move forward and being respectful. The author's empathy towards the dad, given the mom's abusive behavior, might be understandable. It's a common scenario where the non-offending parent is being harassed.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, taking the side of someone who admitted fault and is trying to mend things, while the other parent is being abusive and manipulative, might not make the author the asshole. The author is likely trying to stay neutral as much as possible, but given the circumstances, aligning more with the dad makes sense. The key is that the author isn't being malicious but is reacting to the mom's pushy and harmful actions. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
