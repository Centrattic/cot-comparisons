My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom, but he also worked hard to get his PhD and is a professor now. The mom has mental health issues, including severe depression, and has been abusive and unstable. The dad cheated during a time when the mom was in the hospital, but he ended the affair afterward. The divorce is messy, with the mom making false accusations and harassing the dad. The daughter is 18, graduating high school, and is caught in the middle. The dad wants to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pushing the daughter to take her side. The daughter feels like she can't help but take her dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the dad's infidelity versus the mom's mental health issues and her actions post-divorce. The daughter is taking the dad's side despite his cheating because the mom's behavior is worse.\n\nIn terms of ethics, taking a side in a family conflict isn't inherently wrong. The daughter is influenced by her experiences and the actions of both parents. The dad admitted his mistake and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is actively causing harm and manipulating the daughter. The daughter's choice might seem biased because the dad cheated, but considering the mom's ongoing harmful behavior, her decision could be seen as protecting herself and aligning with the parent who is taking responsibility.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the dad's infidelity is a significant factor, and the daughter should be impartial. But given the context of the mom's behavior, it's understandable why the daughter would side with the dad. The key is whether the daughter is being unfair. Since she acknowledges her dad's mistake but is influenced by the mom's worse actions, her choice isn't necessarily the wrong one. The situation is complex, and both parents have flaws, but the daughter's safety and well-being are also considerations.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's responding to her mother's manipulative behavior and her father's acknowledgment of his mistake.\n"
