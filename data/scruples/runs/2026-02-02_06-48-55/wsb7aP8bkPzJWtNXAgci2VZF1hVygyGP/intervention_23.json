My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old girl whose parents are getting a divorce. Her dad cheated on her mom with a younger grad student. Mom had a mental health crisis, was hospitalized for depression and other issues. The affair happened when the mom was away, and after she got out, she and the dad tried to work things out but ended up in a nasty divorce. The mom is being really difficult, even threatening and involving law enforcement, then sending the video to the dad's department head. The dad has offered everything to get the divorce finalized and is telling the author to be respectful to her mom. However, the mom is pressuring the author to take her side, giving her handwritten letters to deliver and making demands. The author feels like her dad's actions (cheating) were understandable given the mom's behavior and can't help but take his side. The question is, is she the asshole for doing that?\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The dad cheated, which is a significant betrayal. The mom has a history of being emotionally unstable, with episodes where she was morbidly obese, angry, and distant, including being nasty to the dad. The affair coincided with the mom's time in the mental institution. After the mom's release, things temporarily improved but then the divorce became contentious. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving deputies, and trying to manipulate the author. The dad is trying to move on by offering everything in the divorce.\n\nThe author's perspective is that her dad made a mistake, but the mom is being unreasonable and even cruel. She's being pressured by her mom to take her side, but she's choosing her dad's side instead. Now, the question is whether this makes her the asshole.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, when a parent is unwell, the other's actions might be influenced. Cheating is still wrong, but if the mom was being difficult, maybe that's part of the dynamic. The author is caught in the middle, trying to navigate this. She's being respectful to her mom as her dad asks, but her mom is trying to push her to be hostile. The author's support for her dad could stem from understanding his side of the story and the mother's behavior being more destructive.\n\nHowever, the fact that the dad cheated is a major point. Even if the mom had her issues, taking the side of the person who had an affair could be seen as not recognizing the wrong in the cheating. But the author is also not excusing it entirely because she says her dad knows he messed up and is trying to make amends. The mom's actions, on the other hand, are more about retaliation and causing harm. The author might be choosing the parent who is more cooperative and trying to move past the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult now, 18, so she's capable of making her own decisions. But she's still a minor in many places, and the situation is complicated. The key is that the author is not being disrespectful to the mom, despite the mom's demands. She's trying to be neutral as per her dad's request but is not being pressured by the dad\u2014rather, the mom is trying to force her to take a side. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the answer hinges on the child's actions. If the author is not actively undermining her mom but is simply choosing to support the dad in a way that's not harmful, maybe that's not the issue. However, if the mom is in a vulnerable state, the daughter might have a responsibility to support her, but the mom is actually being manipulative and harmful. The dad's cheating is a red flag, but the mom's retaliation is excessive. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. She's not the one who caused the initial problem (the affair), and she's trying to avoid conflict by not taking the mom's side when the mom is being unreasonable. It's possible that her dad's actions were wrong, but the mom's response is even more damaging. The author's choice to take her dad's side might be because she's seeing the bigger picture of the mom's destructive behavior, even if the dad did cheat. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing her dad's perspective, especially since the mom is exhibiting toxic behavior and the dad is taking responsibility. The author isn't avoiding accountability for her dad's actions but is perhaps recognizing that the mom is more to blame for the ongoing conflict. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But I need to consider if taking a parent's side in a divorce is inherently wrong, regardless of the circumstances. However, in this case, the mom is actively trying to manipulate the author, and the author is choosing to distance herself from that. \n\nAnother angle: the author is supporting the parent who is trying to move forward and be mature, even if they made a mistake. The other parent is stuck in the past and causing chaos. The author might not be the asshole here. The answer could be B (No), because she's in a situation where both parents are acting badly, but she's choosing to be on the side of the one who's taking responsibility and trying to end the conflict, even if they were the one who cheated. The cheating is a mistake, but the mom's actions are even more harmful. The author is not wrong for taking her dad's side in this context.\n"
