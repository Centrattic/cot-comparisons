My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the parents are both 35, the kid is 18. The dad was a young parent, worked hard to get his PhD and is a professor now. The mom had mental health issues, sometimes abusive. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital, but he ended the affair afterward. The mom then got out and tried to reconcile, but then called the cops on the dad, sent videos to his employer. The mom is acting out, maybe as a way to cope with her own pain. The author's dad acknowledges his mistake and wants to be done, while the mom is being hostile. The author feels they have to take their dad's side because the mom is being unreasonable and the dad is trying to be respectful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the dad cheated but took responsibility, the mom is acting out in harmful ways, the author isn't being disrespectful but is choosing a parent who's being more reasonable. The author's side is influenced by the mom's behavior and the dad's attempts to resolve things. The author isn't encouraging the cheating, just supporting the dad who's trying to move on. The mom's actions are toxic, so taking the dad's side might be a way to avoid that toxicity. Since the author is a minor, their emotional well-being is also a factor. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the context shows the mom's behavior is problematic, and the author is responding to that.\n"
