My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person writing the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom, then after being caught, there's a messy divorce. The mom has a history of mental health issues, sometimes abusive towards the dad. The dad is trying to move on, offering everything for the divorce. The mom is being hostile, even involving the police in a manipulative way. The author, who's 18, is caught in the middle. The dad tells them to be respectful, while the mom demands they take her side. The author can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the dad cheated, which is a betrayal. Normally, you might take the side of the wronged party. But in this case, the mom's actions post-divorce are extreme and manipulative. She's been abusive, mentally unstable, and is actively trying to harm the dad. The dad, despite the affair, is trying to resolve things amicably. \n\nThe author is a minor, still in high school, facing a lot of pressure from both parents. They're caught between a parent who admitted fault and is trying to move on, and another who's being toxic. Choosing to support the parent who's making a genuine effort to resolve things might be seen as reasonable. \n\nBut taking the dad's side might be seen as ignoring his initial wrongdoing. However, given the mom's behavior, maybe the author is just protecting themselves from a toxic environment. The post also mentions that the dad's affair was during a time when the mom was in a mental health crisis, which might add context. The dad's actions were wrong, but the mom's subsequent behavior is even more harmful. \n\nSo, the author's choice isn't just about the affair. It's about the ongoing toxic dynamic. The author is a teenager, so their judgment might be influenced by wanting stability and safety. The mom's demands for the author to deliver harsh messages and her abusive tendencies could push the author towards the dad. \n\nI think the key here is whether it's fair to take sides based on the current dynamics. The dad made a mistake, but the mom's behavior is escalating conflict. The author isn't choosing to ignore the cheating but is reacting to the mom's continued harmful actions. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're navigating a complex situation where both parents have flaws, but the dad is trying to resolve it while the mom is being abusive. Choosing the parent who is making a genuine effort could be seen as justified. So the answer is B.\n"
