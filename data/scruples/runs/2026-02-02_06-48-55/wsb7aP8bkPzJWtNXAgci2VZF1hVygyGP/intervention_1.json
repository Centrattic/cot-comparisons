My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom, which is definitely a major issue. But there's context. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and abusive towards the dad. When she was admitted to a mental institution, the dad started the affair. Then after she got out, he broke it off but she found out and the divorce became really contentious. The mom is acting out, even involving sheriffs in a false threat accusation. The dad is trying to move on and end the marriage, but the mom is being vindictive.\n\nThe author, who is 18, is caught in the middle. The dad told her to be respectful and go easy on the mom. The mom, however, is pressuring the author to take her side, giving her letters to deliver, and making her say hurtful things to the dad. The author feels that her dad is trying to make things right, while the mom is being malicious. So the author sides with the dad.\n\nNow, should she be in the wrong? Well, it's a tough spot. The dad cheated, which is morally wrong. But the mom's behavior is also extreme and abusive. The author isn't choosing based on who is right, but based on who she perceives as more wronged. The dad admitted his mistake and wants to fix things, while the mom is being vindictive. The author is trying to protect her dad from the mom's abuse. But the question is about taking the dad's side despite his cheating.\n\nBut the context here is that the dad's cheating was during a time when the mom was mentally unwell. The cheating might have been a result of the mom's neglect during her mental health issues. The dad tried to reconcile after the affair. The mom's reaction was disproportionate. The author is caught between both parents' bad behaviors. Choosing to side with the dad who is trying to be accountable versus the mom who is being cruel could be seen as a reasonable choice, especially from the daughter's perspective. However, the dad did commit a betrayal, so there's a balance.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether taking her dad's side is considered wrong because of his infidelity. However, considering the mom's behavior and the dad trying to make amends, her choice might be more about who is being more abusive. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's reacting to the mom's ongoing mistreatment and the dad's willingness to own up to his mistakes. So answer B.\n"
