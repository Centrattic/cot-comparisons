My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school. Their parents are divorced, but the mom had been struggling with mental health issues, including depression and obesity, and was even hospitalized. The dad, who is a professor, had an affair with a grad student when the mom was away in the hospital. After the affair was discovered, the divorce became very contentious. The mom is acting out, involving the police, sending videos to his workplace, and trying to get the author to deliver harsh letters to the dad. The dad is trying to move on and has asked the author to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring the author to take her side.\n\nThe author is taking their dad's side because they see the mom's actions as vindictive and the dad's as trying to fix things. The dad admitted his mistake, while the mom is acting out. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking the dad's side despite his cheating.\n\nHmm. So the dad cheated, which is a serious issue. But the mom's behavior seems extreme and harmful. The author's perspective is that the dad made a mistake but is trying to make things right, while the mom is being abusive. It's a complicated situation. Taking sides in a parent's divorce is tough for a teenager or young adult. The author is trying to be respectful to the mom as per the dad's request, but the mom is being manipulative.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often consider the context. The dad admitted fault and tried to resolve things, while the mom's actions are more harmful. The author might feel that taking the dad's side is to support the parent who is acting more responsibly in the aftermath. However, the dad's cheating is a significant fault. But given the mom's behavior, the author's choice might be seen as not the asshole because they're choosing the parent who is trying to move forward instead of the one who is being abusive.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not the asshole) because the author is in a difficult position and choosing the parent who is more constructive, even though the dad made a mistake. The mom's behavior is more toxic, so supporting the dad isn't wrong.\n"
