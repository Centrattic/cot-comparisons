My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a teenager taking her dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated. The user wants to know if the daughter is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated by hooking up with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The mom then becomes unstable, and there's a messy divorce with her making false accusations against the dad. The dad is trying to move on, offering everything to get the divorce finalized. The mom is acting out, sending the daughter letters to give to the dad, and being hostile. The dad tells the daughter to be respectful, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side.\n\nThe daughter is 18, about to graduate high school, and she's taking her dad's side. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so. \n\nSo, the key points here: the dad cheated, but he's taking responsibility and trying to make amends. The mom is mentally unstable, has a history of being abusive to both the dad and the daughter, and is making things worse by involving the daughter in their conflict. The daughter is choosing to support her dad, who is the one who wronged the mother, but the mother's behavior is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, taking sides in a parent's divorce can be complex. The daughter isn't in the relationship, so her judgment of the parents might be based on limited information. However, she's being directly asked by each parent to take their side. The mom is using the daughter as a middleman for hostility, which is toxic. The dad, on the other hand, is taking responsibility for his mistake and trying to resolve the situation.\n\nThe daughter's choice to support her dad might stem from seeing the dad's remorse and the mom's erratic behavior. However, the fact that the dad cheated is a significant factor. Even if the mom is acting out, the daughter's support for the cheating parent could be seen as not acknowledging that wrong. But maybe the daughter feels the mom's behavior is just as bad, and she's not in a position to judge who's more at fault.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the common theme is about fairness and the impact on others. The daughter isn't a direct victim here, but she's caught in the middle. Supporting her dad might not be inherently wrong, especially if he's being honest and trying to fix things. However, the daughter is not the one who cheated; she's an innocent party. Taking sides might not be her decision to make, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nBut given that the mother is clearly acting out in harmful ways, and the dad is taking responsibility, maybe the daughter is justified in taking her dad's side to protect herself from the mom's toxicity. The question is whether she's wrong for doing that.\n\nIn many AITA threads, the consensus is that kids shouldn't be forced to take sides in parental issues. So the daughter might be in the right to take a side if it's to protect herself or support the parent who is more stable and responsible. However, the dad cheated, so there's a moral wrong there. But since the daughter is 18, maybe she's allowed to support the parent who is being more reasonable, even if they had a fault.\n\nAlternatively, if the daughter is aware that her dad cheated, she might be excused from taking his side because he was the one who wronged the mom. But the daughter isn't the one who cheated; she's just choosing to support her dad. It's possible that she's not in the wrong because she's a teenager trying to navigate a complicated family situation, and the mom is being abusive.\n\nSo considering all that, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents are the ones at fault for dragging her into their conflict. The daughter is choosing to support the parent who is being more responsible, which could be seen as the right choice in this scenario. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
