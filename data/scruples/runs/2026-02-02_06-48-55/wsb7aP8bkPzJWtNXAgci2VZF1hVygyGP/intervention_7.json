My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated on their mom. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school. Their parents are getting divorced after a long, complicated relationship. The dad cheated with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad broke it off after the mom found out, but the divorce is contentious. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving deputies, and trying to get the author to take her side by delivering harsh letters. The dad is trying to resolve things amicably but the mom is dragging it out. The author feels they can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's cheating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated, which is generally considered a moral wrong. But the mom has a history of mental health issues and has been abusive and unstable, both to the dad and the author. The author is caught in the middle, and both parents are manipulating them\u2014dad wants respect, mom wants the author to take her side. The author is trying to navigate this by taking the dad's side, but the dad is the one who cheated. \n\nThe key points here: the dad's infidelity is a clear breach, but the mom's behavior is toxic and harmful. The author is a teenager who's likely trying to make sense of this complex situation. Taking a parent's side is common in such cases, especially when one parent is abusive or manipulative. The question is whether taking the dad's side, despite his cheating, makes the author an asshole. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re reacting to the mom's manipulation and the dad's remorse. The dad admitted fault and is trying to make amends, while the mom is acting out. The author's support for the dad might be based on his genuine remorse and the mom's harmful behavior. So the answer is B (No).\n"
