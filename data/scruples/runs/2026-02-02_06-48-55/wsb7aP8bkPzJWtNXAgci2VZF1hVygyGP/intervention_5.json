My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated on her mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the dad cheated, but he's also a professor who worked hard to get his PhD. The mom has mental health issues, including depression, and has been abusive and manipulative. After the affair, when the mom found out, the divorce became very contentious. The dad is trying to move on, while the mom is acting out, like calling the police and sending videos to his employer. The author feels torn but sides with the dad, thinking he's the victim now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to take her dad's side despite his cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate this based on the given info.\n\nOn one hand, the dad cheated, which is a significant betrayal. The author might feel conflicted because he's her father and she loves him. On the other hand, the mom's behavior is toxic and abusive, and she's using the child to mediate their conflict, which is manipulative. The dad is taking responsibility and trying to resolve the situation, while the mom is acting out in harmful ways.\n\nThe author is caught in the middle. The dad admitted his mistake, and the mom is being emotionally abusive. The author's choice to support her dad could be seen as understandable given the mom's actions. However, taking a side in a divorce is complicated, especially when a parent has committed infidelity.\n\nBut here, the mom is the one actively engaging in manipulative and harmful behavior, making the dad's situation more sympathetic. The author's perspective is that the dad is trying to do the right thing, and the mom is the one causing ongoing harm. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for taking her dad's side, considering the context. The key factors are the mom's abuse and the dad's remorse and efforts to resolve things.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is responding to the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's attempts to make amends, even though he cheated. The situation is nuanced, and taking sides isn't straightforward, but given the mom's actions, the author's choice is justified.\n"
