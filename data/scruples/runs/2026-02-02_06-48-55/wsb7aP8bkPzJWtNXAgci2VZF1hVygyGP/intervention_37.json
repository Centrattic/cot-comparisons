My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking her dad's side during the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, the situation: The dad cheated on the mom, so traditionally, the person who cheated is in the wrong. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, including becoming morbidly obese and being abusive. After the affair, when the mom found out, the divorce became contentious. The mom is acting out, even involving the police in a deceptive way. The author's dad is trying to move on, but the mom is resisting, causing more conflict.\n\nThe author, an 18-year-old daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad has been honest with her about his mistakes and wants to resolve things. The mom is manipulative, giving the daughter tasks like delivering angry letters and making her take her side. The author feels it's easy to side with her dad because of the mom's behavior, but the dad's infidelity is a key point.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The user thinks she is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the dad did cheat, which is morally wrong. Taking his side despite that might seem biased. On the other hand, the mom is in a mental health crisis, acting out, and being manipulative. The daughter is trying to protect herself from the mom's toxicity. The dad has acknowledged his mistake and is trying to make amends. The daughter's support might be a way to find stability, especially as she's about to graduate high school.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? Well, taking sides in a divorce is complex. But in this case, the dad admitted his fault and is seeking resolution, while the mom is in the wrong by being abusive and manipulative. The daughter's support for her dad could be seen as justified given the mom's behavior, even if he did cheat. It's about which parent is acting more responsibly now. The key point is that the daughter is a minor, and taking sides isn't necessarily her responsibility. However, given the context, her choice might be understandable. The answer hinges on which parent is more unreasonably contributing to the conflict. Since the dad is trying to move forward and the mom is the one causing ongoing issues, the daughter's support for her dad might not be wrong.\n"
