My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are in a messy divorce. The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal. The mom has mental health issues, including depression and times when she's been abusive to the dad. After the affair, the mom checked into a mental institution. When she came out, the dad tried to reconcile, but the mom discovered the affair and the divorce became very hostile. The mom has been acting out, using deputies against the dad, and is trying to manipulate the author to take her side. The author is 18, about to graduate high school, and feels torn between the two parents.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side because they see the mom as abusive and the dad as trying to do the right thing, even though he cheated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The dad cheated, which is a betrayal. However, the mom has a history of mental health problems and has been manipulative and abusive. The author is caught in the middle, trying to navigate a toxic situation. Taking a side can be hard when both parents have flaws. The author is clearly aware that the dad did something wrong, but also acknowledges the mom's behavior is worse. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. The author is trying to balance the situation, perhaps seeing the dad's actions as a mistake but the mom's behavior as more harmful. The author isn't necessarily taking sides for the wrong reasons; they're reacting to the mom's manipulation and the dad's attempts to move past the cheating to resolve the divorce. \n\nThe key points are the dad's cheating and the mom's mental health and manipulative behavior. The author is in a tough spot, but siding with the dad might be understandable given the mom's conduct. However, the dad's initial cheating is a significant factor. But considering the context, the author's choice might be justified because the mom's actions are more harmful. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're responding to a complex situation where both parents have flaws, but the mom's behavior is more toxic, and the dad is willing to make amends. The author isn't ignoring the dad's mistake but is taking into account the overall context of the parents' actions.\n"
