My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether taking the dad's side in the divorce, despite him cheating, makes the author an asshole. \n\nFirst, looking at the backstory: the parents are divorced, the dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues and has been abusive and manipulative towards both the dad and the author. The mom ended up in a mental institution, and after coming out, she's been causing a lot of trouble in the divorce, even making false accusations against the dad. The dad admits he messed up and wants to move on, while the mom seems to be dragging things out. The author, an 18-year-old about to graduate high school with honors, is caught in the middle. The mom is pressuring her to take her side, even giving her letters to deliver to the dad, while the dad tells her to be respectful but also wants to be done with the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are the dynamics between the parents and how each is treating the child. The dad cheated, which is definitely a bad action, but he's taking responsibility and trying to make amends by offering everything to get the divorce finalized. On the other hand, the mom has a history of mental health issues leading to instability, which might affect her ability to be a balanced parent. Her actions post-divorce seem to be more about revenge or control, as seen by the false accusations and harassment. \n\nThe author is taking the dad's side, possibly because the mom's behavior is more toxic and harmful. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. The dad's infidelity is a negative point, but if the mom is being abusive and manipulative, the child might feel more aligned with the parent who, while flawed, is trying to be responsible and move forward. \n\nIn such situations, it's often considered that a child isn't in the wrong for aligning with the parent who is more stable, honest, and less harmful. Even if one parent made a mistake, the other's malicious behavior can make the child's choice understandable. The dad is taking accountability and seeking to end the conflict, whereas the mom is escalating it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
