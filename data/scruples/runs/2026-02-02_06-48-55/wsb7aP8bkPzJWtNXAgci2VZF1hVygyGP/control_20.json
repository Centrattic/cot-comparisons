My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad cheated with a grad student during a time when the mom was in a mental institution. After the mom was released, he broke off the affair but the mom discovered it and the divorce became contentious. The mom is described as having severe mental health issues, including periods of depression and anger, and she's been harassing the dad post-divorce. The daughter, who's 18, is taking the dad's side because he admitted fault and is trying to move on, while the mom is acting out and trying to control the daughter to take her side.\n\nThe question is whether the daughter is wrong for taking her dad's side. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Taking a parent's side can be tricky. The dad did cheat, which is a major issue. However, the mom's behavior post-divorce seems extreme and possibly abusive. The daughter is caught in the middle, and her dad is advising her to be respectful, while the mom is pressuring her to take her side with harsh letters and demands.\n\nIn typical family dynamics cases, it's often advised not to take sides, especially when one parent is abusive or manipulative. The mom's actions, like involving law enforcement in a harassing way and sending the video to the department head, suggest she might be gaslighting or trying to damage the dad's career. The daughter might be protecting her dad from these harmful behaviors, which could be justified.\n\nHowever, the dad did cheat, so there's a betrayal there. But the daughter's perspective is that the mom is the one acting out and being destructive. The dad is trying to move past the affair and finalize the divorce, while the mom is dragging it out. The daughter's choice to support the dad might be seen as aligning with the parent who is trying to resolve the conflict rather than exacerbating it.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's not uncommon for children in such situations to take the side of the parent who is perceived as the \"villain\" in the relationship, especially if the other parent is being abusive. The daughter's reasoning\u2014that the dad's actions were a result of the mom's toxicity\u2014might be a way to rationalize her support.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, the act of taking a parent's side isn't inherently wrong, but it can create tension. The daughter isn't directly harming the other parent but is expressing her alignment. Since the mom is pressuring her to take her side and being harsh, the daughter's choice to support the dad might be a form of self-preservation or protecting her father from further harm. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the key is whether the daughter is being unfair. The dad cheated, but the mom's behavior is equally problematic. The daughter's position is that the dad is trying to make amends and move forward, which could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong for taking his side given the circumstances. So the answer would be B.\n"
