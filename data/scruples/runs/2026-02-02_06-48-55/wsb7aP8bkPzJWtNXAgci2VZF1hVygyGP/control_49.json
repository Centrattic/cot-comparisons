My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for taking their dad's side during the divorce, even though the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, about to graduate high school. Her parents divorced because the dad cheated. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including severe depression and obesity, and was abusive towards the dad. After the dad cheated, the mom was admitted to a mental institution. The dad ended the affair when the mom was away, but the mom discovered it through his phone, leading to a contentious divorce. The mom is now acting out, involving authorities, sending harmful messages through the daughter. The dad is trying to move on but the mom is resistant. The author is taking the dad's side despite his infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer based on the analysis. \n\nLooking at the details, the dad cheated, which is a major issue. However, the mom has a history of mental health struggles and has been toxic towards the dad. The dad is trying to reconcile and end the divorce amicably, while the mom is being destructive. The daughter is caught in the middle. The dad is honest about his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is using the daughter to harass him. The daughter is responding to the dad's honesty and the mom's behavior.\n\nIn many such cases, people take sides based on who is being more constructive or abusive. The mom's actions seem more harmful, especially since she's using the child to continue conflict. The dad, despite cheating, is trying to be respectful and end the situation. The daughter's allegiance to the parent who is being more reasonable and taking responsibility might be seen as justified. However, the dad's cheating is a significant factor. But given the mom's behavior, the daughter's choice might be understandable.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, the key is whether the daughter is wrong. Since the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to be respectful, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative, taking the dad's side isn't necessarily wrong. The daughter is not responsible for her parents' actions, just reacting to their behaviors. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
