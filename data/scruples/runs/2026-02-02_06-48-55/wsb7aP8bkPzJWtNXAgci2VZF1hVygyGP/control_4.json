My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are both 35, the author is 18, about to graduate high school. The parents had the author when they were teenagers. The dad worked hard to get his PhD and became a professor. The mom has had mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and abusive. The dad cheated on the mom with a younger grad student when the mom was in a mental institution. After the mom was released, the dad tried to reconcile, but the mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, and trying to involve the author in her vendetta. The dad, on the other hand, has asked the author to be respectful to the mom, while the mom is pressuring the author to take her side. The author feels they can't help but take their dad's side.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for taking their dad's side despite his cheating. \n\nFrom what I read, the dad admitted his fault and is trying to move on. The mom is being abusive and manipulative, both emotionally and possibly legally. The author is caught in the middle. The dad has cheated, which is a significant wrongdoing, but the context is that the mom has a history of instability and the dad's actions might have been influenced by that. The mom's behavior post-divorce seems malicious and harmful. \n\nThe author is trying to navigate a difficult situation where both parents have flaws. The dad admitted his mistake, the mom is acting out. The author is being pressured by both sides. Taking the dad's side could be seen as justifiable because of the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's attempt to make amends, even though he cheated. \n\nBut the dad did cheat, which is a major betrayal. However, the context is important. The mom's mental health issues and the dad's possible emotional strain might have contributed. The author isn't taking the side of the cheater without reason; they see the dad's efforts to reconcile and the mom's vindictiveness.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's choice might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. They are trying to support the parent who is more emotionally stable and is making positive gestures, despite the dad's past mistake. The \"asshole\" in the AITA context usually refers to someone who acted selfishly or wrongly without justification. Here, the author's actions are influenced by the mom's manipulative behavior and the dad's efforts to move forward. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
