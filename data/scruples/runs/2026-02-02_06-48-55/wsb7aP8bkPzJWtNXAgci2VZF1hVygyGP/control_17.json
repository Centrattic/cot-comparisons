My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The dad cheated, which is a big deal. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and abusive. She was admitted to a mental institution for severe depression. The dad cheated when the mom was already in the hospital, but he later broke things off. The mom, upon release, is causing a lot of drama, making false accusations, involving the police, and manipulating the daughter. The daughter is being pressured by the mom to take her side, while the dad is asking the daughter to be respectful. The daughter feels she can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether taking the dad's side makes the daughter an asshole, given that he cheated. Cheating is usually seen as a betrayal, but the context here is important. The mom has significant mental health issues and has been abusive. The dad, despite cheating, is trying to resolve things by offering everything to get the divorce done. The mom is dragging things out, being hostile, and even involving the police with false claims. The daughter is caught in the middle, facing pressure from both sides but being manipulated by the mom.\n\nThe daughter's support for her dad isn't because she condones cheating, but because she sees the mom's behavior as worse. The dad acknowledged his mistake and wants to move on. The mom is creating more harm. The daughter might be protecting her dad from the mom's actions, which are more destructive. The key here is whether taking the dad's side is wrong regardless of his cheating. Since the dad has admitted fault and the mom is the one being abusive and manipulative, the daughter's choice might be justified. The dad's cheating is a past action, and the ongoing harm from the mom is more immediate. The daughter isn't defending the cheating; she's responding to the mom's behavior. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the context shows the dad's actions were a mistake but the mom's ongoing behavior is more harmful, and the daughter is reacting to that.\n"
