My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a teenager taking her dad's side in a divorce where he cheated. The dad cheated on her mom, who has mental health issues. The mom is acting out, even calling the police and sending videos to his job. The dad apologized and wants to move on. The author can't help but support the dad. The question is whether she's the asshole for taking his side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad cheated, which is a big deal. However, the mom has a history of mental health problems, which complicates things. The mom's behavior after the affair is extreme\u2014calling the police, harassment. The dad acknowledged his mistake and tried to make amends. The daughter is caught in the middle, with the mom pressuring her to take her side, and the dad asking her to be respectful. \n\nThe daughter is 18, about to graduate high school with honors. She's under a lot of stress here. Taking sides in a divorce is tough for kids. The dad cheated, but the mom's actions are also harmful. The daughter is choosing her dad because he admitted fault and wants to end the toxic situation. The mom is not only unstable but also making things worse with her behavior. \n\nIs the daughter wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, the dad's infidelity is a mistake, but he's taking responsibility. The mom's actions are more harmful, but she's struggling with mental health. The daughter is reacting to the environment she's in. It's not clear if she's being unfair just because her dad cheated. Both parents have issues, and the daughter is trying to navigate this. \n\nThe key points are: the dad cheated but took responsibility, the mom is unstable and abusive, the daughter is pressured from both sides. The daughter choosing her dad isn't necessarily wrong if she sees the dad's side as trying to make things right. The mom's behavior is worse, so the daughter might not be in the wrong for aligning with the dad who's trying to end the conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's caught in a bad situation where both parents have faults, and she's choosing the parent who is more cooperative and trying to improve things, despite his past mistake.\n"
