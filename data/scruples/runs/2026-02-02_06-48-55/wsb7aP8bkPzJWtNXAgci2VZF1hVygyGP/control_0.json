My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The parents had an unstable marriage. The dad got his PhD, became a professor, and the mom had mental health issues, including severe depression and being admitted to a mental institution. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital. After the mom recovers, the dad breaks off the affair but the mom is still upset and the divorce is contentious. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving the police, and trying to get the daughter to take her side. The dad is trying to resolve things and being respectful to the mom, while the mom is abusive towards the daughter.\n\nThe daughter feels torn. Her dad cheated, but the mom is being toxic and abusive. She ends up taking her dad's side because of the mom's behavior. The question is whether the daughter is wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, taking sides in a family conflict is complex. The dad's cheating is definitely a wrong, but the mom's behavior is equally problematic. The daughter is being manipulated by the mom, who is using her mental health issues to push the daughter to take her side. The dad, on the other hand, is acknowledging his mistake and trying to move forward.\n\nThe daughter's decision to take her dad's side could be seen as a way to protect herself from the mom's negativity. Since the mom is the one causing the ongoing conflict and the dad is trying to resolve things, the daughter's choice isn't necessarily wrong. She's not just taking the dad's side for no reason; she's responding to the mom's abusive behavior. So, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole) because the daughter is in a tough situation, and her side is chosen due to the mother's toxic actions, which are the real issue here.\n"
