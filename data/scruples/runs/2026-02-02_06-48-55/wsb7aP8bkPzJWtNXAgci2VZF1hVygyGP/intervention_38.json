My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, despite the dad cheating. The situation is pretty complex. The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal, but there's also a lot of context about the mom's mental health struggles, her treatment of the dad and the child, and her actions post-divorce. \n\nFirst, the dad cheated, so that's a clear wrongdoing. The author knows he messed up and the dad acknowledges it. But the mom has been emotionally abusive and manipulative, even sending the child to deliver harsh letters and making false accusations leading to the dad being handcuffed. The dad is trying to move forward and get the divorce finalized, while the mom is dragging it out, possibly for revenge.\n\nThe author feels torn but ends up taking the dad's side. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the dad cheated, so taking his side might seem to ignore that. On the other, the mom's behavior is toxic and abusive. The author is an 18-year-old adult, so they have the right to choose their side, especially given the context. The dad is taking responsibility and trying to make amends, whereas the mom is being vindictive. The author's decision could be seen as self-preservation, aligning with the parent who is more emotionally stable and trying to move on. \n\nBut is taking the dad's side making the author the asshole? Well, the dad did cheat, but the mom's actions are also harmful. The author isn't shaming the dad for the mistake but is recognizing the mom's ongoing harmful behavior. The key here is that the author isn't ignoring the dad's fault but is considering the broader picture of both parents' actions. Since the author is an adult, their choice to support the parent who is trying to fix things and avoid the toxic parent is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're making a choice based on their lived experience with both parents' behaviors, not just the cheating. The situation is nuanced, and the author's decision is a personal one that doesn't ignore the dad's mistake but balances both parents' actions.\n"
