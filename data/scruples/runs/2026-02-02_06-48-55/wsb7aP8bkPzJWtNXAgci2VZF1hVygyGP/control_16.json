My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, considering the dad cheated but the mom is acting out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital. He then ended the affair and tried to reconcile. The mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is described as having mental health issues, being abusive, and using extreme tactics like involving sheriffs. The dad is remorseful and trying to resolve things amicably. The daughter is being pressured by both sides but ends up taking the dad's side because of his cheating and the mom's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's infidelity and the mom's subsequent actions. Cheating is a significant betrayal, but the mom's response seems to be extreme and possibly abusive. The daughter is caught in the middle, with the dad encouraging respect and the mom forcing her to take sides.\n\nThe question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for siding with the dad. From a moral standpoint, children often take sides based on their perception of fairness. Here, the dad admitted fault and tried to make amends, while the mom is acting out in harmful ways. The daughter's choice isn't just about the affair but the overall behavior of both parents. Since the dad is taking responsibility and the mom is being abusive, the daughter's choice might be justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that taking a side at all could be problematic, but given the context of the mom's actions, it's understandable. The daughter isn't just ignoring the dad's mistake; she's weighing both parents' behaviors. The answer would likely be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
