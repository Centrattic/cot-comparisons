My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, despite him cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues and unstable behavior. The mom was admitted to a mental institution, and after that, the dad had an affair. Now, post-divorce, the mom is acting out, harassing the dad, making false accusations, involving authorities. The dad is trying to make peace, offering everything to finalize the divorce. The author, the daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad tells her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom demands the daughter take her side, giving her mean letters to deliver and making her say hurtful things. The daughter feels she can't help but take her dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' behaviors. The dad cheated, which is a serious issue, but the mom's actions post-divorce are also extreme\u2014harassment, false accusations, involving law enforcement, etc. The daughter is being pressured by both sides. The dad acknowledges his mistake and is trying to resolve things amicably, while the mom is acting out in a way that's harmful and vindictive.\n\nIn such situations, the child's loyalty can be torn. However, taking a parent's side isn't inherently wrong, especially when one parent is being unreasonable or abusive. The daughter isn't excusing the dad's infidelity but is responding to the mom's toxic behavior. The mom's actions might be more harmful in the long run, so the daughter's choice to side with the parent who is trying to de-escalate the situation and move forward could be seen as self-preservation or protecting her father from further harm.\n\nBut does that make her the asshole? The term \"asshole\" implies that she's in the wrong without nuance. However, the daughter's perspective is that her mother is being cruel and manipulating her, while her father is remorseful and trying to make things better. The daughter's bias could be a result of her own experiences and the toxic environment created by the mother. \n\nIn many similar cases, people argue that children aren't responsible for their parents' actions and that taking sides isn't their fault, especially when one parent is acting out. The daughter isn't causing the problem; she's reacting to it. The mother's demands and the dad's reasonable approach might make the daughter's stance more understandable. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
