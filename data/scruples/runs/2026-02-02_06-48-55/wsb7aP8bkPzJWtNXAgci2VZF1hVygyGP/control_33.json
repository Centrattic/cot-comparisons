My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong by taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are both 35, the author is 18. They had the author when they were teenagers. The dad went on to get a PhD and became a professor. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and mistreating the author and the dad. The dad cheated on the mom with a younger grad student when the mom was in the hospital for depression. After the mom was released, the dad ended the affair but the mom found out through his phone and the divorce turned nasty. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving the police, and trying to get the author to take her side. The author feels compelled to take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's admission of fault.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a minor, 18, about to graduate high school. The situation is complex. The dad cheated, which is definitely wrong. However, the mom has a history of mental health issues and is acting out in harmful ways. The author is caught in the middle. The dad has acknowledged his mistake and is trying to resolve things. The mom is being manipulative and abusive, both to the dad and the author.\n\nThe author isn't taking the dad's side purely because he cheated, but because of the overall context\u2014his remorse, the mom's behavior, her manipulation, and the harm she's causing. The author is a teenager, possibly still dependent on both parents, but the mom's actions seem to be more harmful in this scenario. The author is not condoning the affair but is taking into account the entire situation. \n\nIn such cases, taking the side of the parent who is more stable and remorseful isn't necessarily wrong, especially when the other parent is being abusive or manipulative. The author's judgment is influenced by the ongoing mistreatment and the dad's attempts to make amends. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are just trying to navigate a very difficult and toxic situation.\n"
