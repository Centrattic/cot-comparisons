My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their father's side in the divorce, given the father cheated but the mother has been abusive in her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the situation. The author is 18, about to graduate high school. The parents were teenagers when they had her. The dad worked hard to get a PhD and became a professor. The mom has had mental health issues, including depression, obesity, and anger issues. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student when the mom was in a mental institution. After the mom was released, the dad tried to reconcile, but the mom discovered the affair through his phone. The divorce became contentious, with the mom allegedly making false accusations against the dad, like calling the police and spreading videos. The dad has apologized and wants to end the marriage, while the mom is acting out, including sending the author letters to deliver to the dad.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side because he admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is being hostile. The author's dad told her to be respectful, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side. The question is whether the author is wrong for siding with the dad despite his infidelity.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's complex. The dad cheated, which is a significant betrayal. However, the mom's behavior has been abusive and manipulative, including mental health issues and harassment. The author might feel torn, but her empathy towards the dad could stem from seeing his efforts to make amends and the mom's continued harmful actions.\n\nIn AITA contexts, there's often an emphasis on fairness and understanding both sides. Taking sides can be difficult, especially for a teenager. The author's choice isn't necessarily wrong if she feels it's justified given the mom's actions. However, some might argue that the dad's infidelity is a major issue. But given the mom's behavior, the author might feel the dad is the more deserving of support here.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the context shows the mother's behavior is toxic and manipulative, and the father has acknowledged his mistake. The author's decision to take her father's side, despite his infidelity, could be seen as a way to seek stability in a difficult situation. However, others might argue that the father's actions were wrong regardless of the mother's behavior. But considering the mother's actions, the author's stance is more about protecting her father from further harm and recognizing his attempts to make things right. So, B makes sense.\n"
