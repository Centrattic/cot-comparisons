My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and even getting hospitalized. The dad, on the other hand, got his PhD and is now a professor. The affair happened when the mom was in the mental institution, and he broke it off after she was released. However, the mom then snoop on his phone, found out, and the divorce became very contentious. The mom is allegedly harassing the dad, involving the police, and making the daughter deliver nasty letters. The dad told the daughter to be respectful to her mom, while the mom pressures her to take her side.\n\nThe daughter is 18, graduating high school, and feels torn. She acknowledges her dad's mistake but finds it easy to take his side because of the mom's behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the dad cheated, so he did something wrong. However, the mom's actions are also problematic. The daughter is caught in the middle. The key point here is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. \n\nIn many cases, taking sides in a divorce can be complex. The daughter is being manipulated by both parents. The mom is pressuring her to take her side, and the dad is trying to be respectful. The daughter's choice might be influenced by the mom's abusive behavior and the dad's acknowledgment of his fault but also his desire to move on. \n\nThe daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing a parent who is trying to make amends and is being honest, even if he made a mistake. The mom's actions are more harmful and controlling. The daughter's decision might be a way to protect herself from the mom's toxicity. \n\nSo, while the dad did cheat, the daughter's loyalty isn't the main issue here. The real fault lies with the parents for putting their child in this situation. The daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing the parent who is more considerate and trying to resolve things, even if he made a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
