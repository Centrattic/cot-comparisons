My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, being unkind to the dad, and after the affair, she's been acting out, even involving the police in a harassing way. The daughter is caught in the middle. The dad admitted his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is being difficult and aggressive. The daughter feels pulled to take her dad's side because he's the one who cheated but also seems to be the victim of her mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the key points here. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the dad is at fault there. However, the mom's actions post-affair, like involving deputies and harassment, are also problematic. The daughter isn't being disrespectful; she's choosing a parent who acknowledged his mistake and wants reconciliation. The mom is pushing the daughter to take her side and even gives her letters to deliver, which is manipulative. The daughter is in a tough spot, trying to navigate a toxic situation.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, the dad admitted his wrongdoing, and the daughter is reacting to both parents' behaviors. The mom's actions are more aggressive and manipulative, so the daughter isn't necessarily at fault for choosing the parent who's being more cooperative and taking responsibility. The daughter isn't blaming the mom for the cheating; she's just taking into account both sides of the story. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
