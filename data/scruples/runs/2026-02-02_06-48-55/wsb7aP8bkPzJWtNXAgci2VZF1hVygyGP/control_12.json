My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated. The situation is complicated. The dad cheated on the mom, but the mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression, and she's been very difficult, even abusive towards the dad. After the affair, when the mom found out, there was a messy divorce with her harassing the dad, involving the police, and sending the video of his arrest to his department head. The dad apologized and tried to make amends, but the mom is holding a grudge.\n\nThe author is 18, a high school graduate, and has a close relationship with her dad, who supported her through her education. The mom is pushing the daughter to take her side, even giving her letters to deliver. The daughter feels torn but can't help but take her dad's side, given the mom's behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are the dad's infidelity versus the mom's retaliatory and potentially abusive behavior. The daughter is caught in the middle. The question is whether taking the dad's side is justified. The dad cheated, which is a significant wrongdoing, but the mom's actions could be seen as equally harmful. The daughter is in a tough spot, as she's being manipulated by both parents but feels closer to the dad who admitted his mistakes and tried to fix things, while the mom is being vindictive.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the daughter is choosing based on her perception of who is more at fault or who is being more abusive, she might not be in the wrong. The dad's cheating is a clear fault, but the mom's response might be equally problematic. The daughter's support for her dad could be seen as acknowledging his efforts to take responsibility versus the mom's ongoing hostile behavior. So the answer might be B, No, she's not in the wrong because she's reacting to the mom's manipulation and the dad's admission of fault.\n"
