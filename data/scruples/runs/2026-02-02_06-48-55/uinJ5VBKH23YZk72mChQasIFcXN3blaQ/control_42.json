Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy, but some customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2k tip from a big customer, and now the owners are enforcing a stricter policy. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the owner says the author can keep it, but future tips must go into a common fund.\n\nThe author is conflicted about keeping the tip or sharing it. The question is whether they're in the wrong. So, first, the policy was non-tipping, but the owners allowed tips in practice. Now they're changing the policy. The author received a tip before the new policy was enforced. The owner said it's up to them whether to keep it, but future tips must be shared. So, since the author was allowed to keep this particular tip, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, some might argue that since the policy is now changing, even past tips might need to be shared. But the owner specifically said it's up to them. Also, the author is in a tough financial situation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should share because the new policy is about fairness. But the owner didn't require sharing this one. So the author isn't violating the new policy by keeping it. The other waitress reported them, but the owner didn't make them share it. So technically, they can keep it. But morally, some might say it's unfair to keep a large tip when others might have gotten smaller ones. But the question is about being in the wrong. Legally or according to the restaurant's policy, the owner allowed keeping it. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's an ethical angle. Hmm.\n"
