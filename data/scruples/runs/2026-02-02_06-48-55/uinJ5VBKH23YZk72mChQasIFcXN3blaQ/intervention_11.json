Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a policy where tips are supposed to be pooled, but the owners turned a blind eye before. Now, after a large tip, the owners are enforcing the policy and want the tip to be shared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the owners have stated that tips must be shared, then the author is expected to comply. Even if the owners were previously lenient, the current policy is clear now. The author received the tip before the policy change, but the owners are still holding them accountable. \n\nThe author argues that they're not rich and need the money for the holidays. However, the policy isn't about personal need but about fairness and equality among staff. If the policy is in place to ensure all tips are pooled, keeping the money could be seen as selfish, especially since others might not have the same opportunity. \n\nAlso, the fact that the owners are enforcing this now might mean that the author should have anticipated this when they accepted the tip. Even if the owners didn't explicitly mention sharing before, the policy was in place. The author's decision to keep the money could undermine the new policy and set a bad precedent. \n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the owners allowed it before, so maybe the author didn't know it would be enforced strictly. However, once the policy is clear, the responsibility is on the employees to follow it. The author has a choice to either comply or not, and not sharing could be seen as breaking the new rules. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if others are required to share, the author should too, even if it's a large amount. The alternative is creating an unequal system where some get to keep tips and others don't. The author's situation is unique (large tip), but the policy applies to all. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong because they should follow the established policy now that it's enforced, even if it's personal need. The community might emphasize fairness and policy adherence over individual circumstances.\n"
