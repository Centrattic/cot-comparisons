Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy but turned a blind eye in the past. The author got a $2,000 tip from a rich customer (an NBA player). Another waitress reported this, leading to a stricter policy. The owners allowed the author to keep it but now want tips to be pooled. The author is conflicted about sharing because they need the money, but they don't want to be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are: What was the original policy? The restaurant said no tipping, but allowed it informally. When the new policy is enforced, the author got a tip before the change. Now, the owners are making tips go into a common fund. The author is deciding whether to keep the tip or share it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the restaurant owners initially allowed it, but after someone reported it, they changed the policy. The author received the tip under the old policy. The owners then said the author can keep it, but future tips must be shared. The question is whether the author should share the tip they received under the previous policy.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the policy was changed after the fact, the author might feel they had a right to keep it since they were following the previous rules. However, the new policy implies that moving forward, tips must be shared. The others might argue that since the policy is now in place, the author should share the tip to be consistent. But the author didn't know the policy was going to change when they received the tip.\n\nAlso, the waitress who reported it might be trying to enforce the new policy retroactively, which could be unfair to the author. The author isn't being greedy if they received the tip under the old rules. However, the owners let them keep it, which suggests they aren't in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to share it now, especially since the policy is new.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the existing policy at the time, and the owners allowed them to keep it. The new policy applies to future tips, not past ones. The author is justified in keeping the tip they received under the previous rules. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
