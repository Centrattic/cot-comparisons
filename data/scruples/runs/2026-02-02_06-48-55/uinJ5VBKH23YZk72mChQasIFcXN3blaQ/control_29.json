Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2000 tip with their fellow waiters. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye before. The writer got a huge tip from an NBA player, kept it, and now others are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies. The restaurant's official policy is no tipping, but there was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. Then after the incident, the owners became stricter, saying tips must go into a common fund. The writer was told they could decide to keep the existing tip or share it. \n\nSo the question is whether keeping the tip is wrong. The author argues that they're not rich, need the money for the holidays, and the owners didn't enforce the policy before. The other waitresses reported it, leading to a policy change. Now the author is conflicted between keeping the money or sharing it. \n\nLegally and ethically, if the restaurant's policy now requires sharing tips, the author should comply. But the owners allowed them to keep it this time. However, the author might be seen as taking advantage of a loophole. On the other hand, the previous policy was ambiguous. \n\nThe key points: The owners changed the policy after the fact, but the original infraction was when the tip was taken. The author might have acted in good faith before the policy was enforced. Now, with the new policy, they have the choice. If they choose to keep it despite the new rule, they could be seen as defiant. But since the owners let them decide, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that others are upset and the policy was changed because of the incident might mean the author should share to maintain team harmony. But the user is asking if they're \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. Depending on perspective, some might say the author should share because the policy now requires it, while others might empathize with their financial situation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision to keep the tip aligns with the restaurant's new policy. Since the owners gave them the choice, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the policy is now enforced, keeping it could be seen as not following the new rules. But the owners allowed them to keep it. Hmm. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were given the option. Answer B.\n"
