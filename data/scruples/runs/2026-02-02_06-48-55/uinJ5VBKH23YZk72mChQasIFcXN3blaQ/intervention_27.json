Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the person who got a $2000 tip at a non-tipping restaurant should share it with their coworkers. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The user got a huge tip from an NBA player, and after some backlash, the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly. Now, the user is being asked to either turn over the tip or split it, but they're considering keeping it all.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is clear: no tipping. Even though the owners were lax before, they're now enforcing it. The user got a tip when the policy was in place, so according to the new rules, they shouldn't have kept it. However, the owners gave them a choice after the fact. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for keeping the tip instead of splitting it.\n\nThe user argues that they're not rich, live in a studio, and need the money, especially with upcoming holidays. The alternative of splitting would leave them with only $150, which isn't enough. On the other hand, the waitress who reported them caused the situation to escalate, which might make the user feel wronged. But the key point is the policy. If the restaurant owners said it's now a common fund, even if it's not enforced retroactively, the user might be expected to comply. However, the owners allowed them to keep it, so maybe there's a gray area.\n\nEthically, if the policy is that all tips go into a common pool, then keeping it could be seen as selfish. But if the owners gave them a choice, perhaps the user isn't wrong for taking the opportunity. The user might not be in the wrong if the owners didn't enforce it retroactively. However, if the policy is meant to be collective, not sharing could be seen as violating the spirit of the policy, even if the owners didn't explicitly require splitting past tips. There's a balance between personal need and fairness to others. Since the user is in a tough financial situation, maybe the answer leans towards not being in the wrong. But if the policy is meant to be collective, then sharing might be expected, making the user in the wrong.\n"
