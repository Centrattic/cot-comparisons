Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a non-tipping restaurant where the staff is supposed to not accept tips. The author got a $2K tip from a customer, kept it, and now the restaurant is enforcing a new policy where tips have to be shared in a common fund. The author is considering keeping the money instead of sharing it, which would leave them with $150. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye before. The author benefited from that leniency. Now the policy is stricter, and tips must be shared. The author got a significant tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners gave them the choice to keep it or share. The author is choosing to keep it despite the new policy, which might be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency. \n\nThe other waiters are upset, and the reporter is part of the group. The author's argument is that they're not rich and need the money, especially for holidays. However, the restaurant's policy now requires sharing, so maybe the author should comply. \n\nBut wait, the owners said it's up to the author to decide since it was before the new policy. If the policy was changed after the fact, maybe the author isn't obligated to share. However, the previous leniency was part of a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. Now that the policy is strict, maybe the owners expect that any past tips should be shared moving forward, but the author already had the chance to keep it. \n\nThe key points are: the restaurant's policy, the owner's announcement about future tips, and the author's choice regarding the past tip. If the owners allowed past tips to be kept, then technically the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is now being asked to share past tips, they might be in the wrong. But in the scenario, the owners said it's up to the author to keep it, so they might not be obligated. \n\nBut the author is choosing to keep the money despite the new policy, which could be seen as selfish. The new policy is to prevent future tips from being kept, but the author is holding onto a past tip. The other waiters might feel that since the policy is now strict, all tips should be shared, including past ones. But the owners didn't mandate that; they left it to the author's discretion. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author is obligated to share a tip they received under a previous policy. If the owners allowed them to keep it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is now being asked to share it with others, even though the policy was different before, maybe they are. However, the owners didn't enforce sharing for past tips, so the author's decision to keep it might be justified. \n\nAlternatively, the moral argument is about fairness. Even if allowed, the author might feel it's right to share with colleagues who also work hard. But the author argues they need the money. This is a personal choice. If the owners allowed them to keep it, then technically they're not in the wrong. But if the author is choosing to keep it despite the new policy, which could be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency, they might be in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even though the policy changed after the fact, the author is being asked to share the tip now that the policy is stricter. The owners gave them a choice, but the author is choosing to keep it, which might not be fair to colleagues who now can't get such tips. But if the owners said it's up to the author, then maybe they're not in the wrong. This is a bit tricky. The key is the owners' decision. If they allowed the author to keep it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is being asked to share it now, but the owners didn't enforce that, then maybe not. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the owners gave them the choice. But maybe the answer is A because the author is not sharing when the new policy emphasizes fairness. I'm torn. Let me check the original question again. The owners said it's up to the author to keep it or share. So the author isn't obligated. Therefore, the answer is B. Wait, but the author is choosing to keep it despite the new policy, which might be seen as selfish. However, since the owners allowed it, technically they're not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
