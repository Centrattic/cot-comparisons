Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The restaurant is non-tipping but has a high base salary. The owners have a don't ask, don't tell policy about tips. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer, and now the owners are enforcing a strict no-tipping policy. The other waitress reported the author, and the owners said it's up to the author to keep the tip or share it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but they allowed it in practice before. Now they're changing the policy. The author received a tip under the old, more lenient policy. The question is whether the author should share the tip now that the policy is stricter. \n\nThe owners gave the author the choice to keep it, but the author is considering keeping it despite the new policy. The other waiters are upset, and the author is concerned about their own financial situation. \n\nLegally, in some places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff, but the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, which might mean they don't share tips. However, the new policy requires tips to be turned into a common fund. The author received the tip before this new policy was enforced. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because the policy changed after they got the tip. If the policy had been in place before, they wouldn't have kept the tip. Now, the owners are allowing them to keep it, but others might feel it's unfair. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the owners allowed them to keep it, so maybe not. But the author is being asked to share with others, even though the policy changed after the fact. There's also the aspect of fairness\u2014if others follow the new policy and can't keep tips, but the author got an exception. \n\nOn one hand, the author is acting in their own interest. On the other, it might set a bad precedent. The restaurant's previous policy was not clear, which led to this situation. The owner's decision to let the author keep the tip might be their way of resolving it without conflict, but the author is conflicted about being a \"terrible person.\" \n\nI think the answer depends on the owner's decision. Since they allowed the author to keep it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author had to choose between keeping it (which benefits them) or sharing it (which is fair to others), maybe the ethical choice is to share. But the owner's choice might take precedence here. So if the owner says it's okay, then the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the author should share because the new policy says tips go to a common fund, even if it's after the fact. Hmm.\n"
