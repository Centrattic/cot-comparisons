Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2K tip they received in a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, which the owners initially didn't enforce strictly. The author received a tip from a customer, kept it, and now the owners are cracking down. The other waiters found out and there's a new policy where tips must be shared in a common fund. The author is considering keeping the tip they already received, but the others are upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The restaurant's policy was non-tipping, even if the owners were lenient before. 2) The author took the tip without sharing it, which now the policy says can't happen. 3) The author is deciding whether to keep the money or split it now after the policy change.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the tip. Legally, maybe the restaurant's policy was non-binding, but ethically, since the owners and staff are now enforcing sharing, the author is in a position where they should comply. Also, the fact that the owners said it's up to them to keep it but the others are upset complicates things. The author is benefiting from a previous leniency that's now being revoked. So, ethically, sharing the tip might be the fair thing to do, even if the initial policy wasn't clear. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing now that the policy is stricter. Answer A.\n"
