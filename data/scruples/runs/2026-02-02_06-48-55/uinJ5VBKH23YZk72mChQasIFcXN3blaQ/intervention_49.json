Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip with other waiters at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author received a $2k tip from a customer, which the owners allowed them to keep after a meeting. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a stricter policy. Now the author is deciding whether to keep the money or split it, which would leave them with only $150.\n\nI need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the owners officially changed the policy to require tips to be shared, then keeping it would be against the new rules. However, in the meeting, the owners gave the author the choice to keep the existing tip. So maybe they weren't required to share it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the owners allowed the author to keep it suggests that the decision is up to them. But there's a social aspect\u2014other staff might expect sharing since they have a common fund now. However, the author is in a financial bind, living in a studio apartment and needing money for holidays. \n\nThe question is whether keeping the tip makes them the asshole. If the owners allowed it, maybe they're not in the wrong. But maybe the author should still consider sharing as a gesture of goodwill, even if not required. However, the author's financial situation is a valid reason to keep it. \n\nHmm. The key points are: the owners gave permission to keep the existing tip, so the author isn't violating any policy. The author isn't being selfish if they're in financial need. But others might argue that since the policy now requires sharing future tips, the existing one should be shared. But the owners didn't enforce that retroactively. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the owners allowed them to keep it. The author isn't obligated to share it since it was before the new policy was strictly enforced. Plus, the financial need is a factor. The other waitress started the issue by reporting it, which might imply the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
