Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant that has a \"non-tipping\" policy. The base salary is higher than usual, but sometimes customers still leave tips. The restaurant owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy about tips. Then, the author gets a $2000 tip from a customer (an NBA player and friends), but when someone reports this, the owners decide to enforce the no-tipping policy more strictly. The author is now being asked if they should share the tip with the other waiters or keep it, and they're worried about being a bad person if they don't split it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners didn't have a strict policy before, but after this incident, they're changing it. The author was allowed to keep the tip because it was before the new policy. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share it. So legally or by policy, the author isn't forced to share it, since the policy was changed after the fact. But morally, is it right to keep it?\n\nThe restaurant had a higher base salary, which implies that tips might be considered part of their income structure, but the policy was non-tipping. The fact that the owners turned a blind eye before might mean that they expected tips to be kept by the individual server. However, after the incident, they now require any tips to be turned into a common fund. The author received the tip under the old policy, so technically, under the new policy, they might have to share, but the owners gave them the choice.\n\nThe other waitress reported the tip, leading to the policy change. Now, the author is being asked to share. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong if they keep the tip. The key points here are policy changes, fairness among staff, and personal financial need.\n\nIf the author kept the tip under the previous lenient policy, and the owners only changed the policy after the fact, the author might argue that they followed the existing policy at the time. However, the new policy affects future tips, not retroactively. But the author is now being asked to share past tips. If the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong to do so. However, if the restaurant's policy is that tips should be shared, even if not enforced before, the author might be expected to share now.\n\nBut the owners didn't enforce the sharing of past tips except in this case. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting and policy change. The owners gave the author the choice, so if they choose to keep it, they aren't violating any current policy. However, there's a social aspect\u2014should the author share for fairness? If other waiters didn't get tips, but the author did, maybe there's a shared expectation of sharing, even if the policy didn't require it before. But the author isn't obligated by policy to share, so maybe they aren't in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant's culture includes sharing tips (like in some tipping systems), then the author might be expected to share. But the restaurant is non-tipping, so the tip was an exception. The fact that the owner allows the author to keep it suggests that they aren't in the wrong. The author's financial situation is also a factor\u2014they need the money for holidays. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the policy allowed keeping it, and the owner gave permission to do so.\n"
