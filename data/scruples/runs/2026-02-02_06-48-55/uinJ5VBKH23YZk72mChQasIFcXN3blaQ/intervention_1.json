Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant that claims to have a no-tipping policy. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, meaning they don't enforce it strictly. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, which is a significant amount. Now, after being caught, the owners are cracking down and the author has to decide whether to keep the money or share it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners turned a blind eye before, but now they're making it clear that tips have to be turned into a common fund if given. The author was given the option to keep the existing tip but not to accept any more. The other waitress reported them, which led to this situation. \n\nThe key points here are the policy and fairness. If the restaurant's policy is that tips should be shared, then keeping the $2000 without splitting it would be against that policy. However, the owners didn't enforce it before, and the author wasn't explicitly told to share it until after the fact. The author is now in a dilemma because the policy has changed, and they're being asked to share the money they already received.\n\nBut here's the thing: the policy was unclear for a while. The owners allowed tips to be kept as long as they weren't reported. Now, with the policy being enforced, the author is in a bind. They might argue that they didn't know the new rules when they received the tip. However, the owners didn't specify that existing tips would be shared. The new waitress reported the tip, which led to the meeting and the new policy. \n\nThe author is now being asked to share the tip, but the owners said it's up to them. So technically, they have the choice. But is it fair to keep the entire amount when the new policy is to share? If the restaurant starts enforcing sharing, maybe the author should comply even for past tips. However, the owners didn't make that clear. They only mentioned future tips would be in a common fund. The author might feel they were in the dark about the policy and the new waitress's report was the trigger for the change.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the restaurant had a strict policy from the start, the author would be wrong for keeping it. But since the policy was murky and only became strict after the tip was given, maybe it's a bit of a gray area. The author is in a tough spot financially, so keeping the money could be seen as understandable. However, the other waiters might argue that they should share it since the policy now requires it. \n\nAnother angle: the owners allowed tips to be kept before, so the author might think they were acting within the established norms. Now that the policy is changing, the author is left to decide. If the owners allowed it before, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. But the new waitress's report led to the policy change, which complicates things. The author could be seen as taking advantage of a loophole that's now closed. \n\nIn summary, the author is in a tricky situation. The policy was unclear, and the owners didn't enforce it until after the fact. The waitress who reported them might have had good intentions in enforcing the policy, but the author is now being asked to comply with a new rule. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the restaurant's new policy applies retroactively. If it does, then the author should share. If not, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. Since the owners said it's up to the author to keep it, maybe they aren't obligated to share. However, ethically, sharing could be the fairer choice even if the owners don't force it. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about doing the right thing ethically. So if the policy doesn't require it, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the policy now requires sharing, even past tips, then they are. But the owners didn't explicitly say that. So it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the policy was ambiguous, but there's an argument for A if the new policy applies retroactively. However, the owners didn't make that clear. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were following the previous, unspoken policy.\n"
