Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a restaurant that's supposed to be non-tipping, but sometimes customers leave tips anyway. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they ignore it as long as no one brings it up. The author got a $2K tip from a customer (an NBA player and friends, total bill $8K), and now the owners are enforcing a strict no-tipping policy, requiring any tips to be shared with the staff.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the actions of the waitstaff. The restaurant's base salary is higher than normal, so maybe they're compensating for the lack of tips. The new waitress reported the tip, leading to the policy change. Now the author has to decide whether to keep the $2K or share it, which would leave them with $150. The question is whether they're in the wrong by choosing to keep it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy was non-tipping, but they allowed tips discreetly before. The owners are now changing the policy, possibly because the new waitress brought it up. The author didn't know if the policy was going to be enforced this strictly until the meeting. The owners said it's the author's choice whether to keep the tip or share it, but the common fund idea is that if a customer insists on leaving a tip, it should go into a shared fund. However, the author already received the $2K tip before the policy change was announced. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is obligated to share tips they already received, even though the policy was previously unenforced. If the owners didn't mention that past tips need to be shared in the new policy, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The waitress who reported the tip might have a point if the policy was supposed to be enforced retroactively, but the owners didn't explicitly say that. The author could argue they were following the previous unspoken rules. However, there's also the aspect of fairness to other staff members, especially if the new policy is meant to distribute tips more evenly. \n\nBut the problem is, the new policy is about future tips, not past ones. The owners didn't state that they want to collect back tips; they just announced future tips must go into a common fund. So the $2K tip was given under the old policy, which was more lenient. The author didn't do anything wrong before the policy change. Now, the waitress is asking about it, perhaps expecting the author to share it now. However, the owners allowed the author to choose whether to keep it or not. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they received before the new rules. The owners made a decision, and the author was given the option. The new waitress's complaint might be about the inconsistency, but the author followed what was allowed at the time. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
