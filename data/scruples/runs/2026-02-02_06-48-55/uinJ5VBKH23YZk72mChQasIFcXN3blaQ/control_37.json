Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for keeping the tip they received. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe restaurant is high-end and has a no-tipping policy. The staff has a higher base salary, which is common in some places where tips are supposed to be included in the meal cost. However, occasionally, customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye, so it's kind of an informal don't-ask-don't-tell situation. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer (part of an NBA player's $10K tip on an $8K bill). Another waitress reported this, leading to a meeting where the owners now enforce a strict policy of not accepting tips, and any tips must go into a common fund. The author is being asked if they should share the tip they already received with others, which would leave them with only $150. The author is conflicted, wanting to keep it for personal reasons but not wanting to be seen as a bad person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Initially, there was a lenient approach, so maybe the staff was aware that they could keep tips if they weren't caught. Now, the policy is changing, and moving forward, tips must be shared. However, the author already received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it. So the question is whether keeping it now is wrong.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, if the policy was enforced after the fact, the author might be in a gray area. The owners allowed the previous leniency, so the author didn't know they had to share it. But now that the policy is stricter, the author is being asked to share. However, the owners gave them the choice. If the policy was not clear before, maybe the author isn't at fault for keeping it. On the other hand, if the staff is expected to share tips when possible, then keeping it might be considered selfish.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of tip pooling. In many restaurants, especially those with a no-tipping policy, tips are pooled and distributed among staff. If the new policy enforces this, then the author should share. However, since they were allowed to keep the tip previously, and the new policy isn't retroactive, maybe they are within their rights to keep it. The owners left it up to them, so it's a personal choice rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the financial situation: the author is not rich, lives in a studio apartment, and needs the money for the upcoming holidays. If the policy change is retroactive, the author might be unfairly penalized for past actions. But the owners didn't say to return the tip, they just said future tips must be shared. So the author is in a position where they can choose to keep it. \n\nPotential arguments against the author: They should have known that tips should be shared, even if the policy wasn't strict before. The new policy is fair, and if others share, the author should too. The author is being selfish by not sharing when others might need it.\n\nArguments for the author: The policy wasn't clear before, and they followed the existing leniency. The owners allowed them to keep it, so there's no obligation to share now. They are in a difficult financial situation, and the money is important to them.\n\nIn many cases, tips are considered the property of the server who receives them unless the establishment has a policy in place that requires sharing. However, in this case, the new policy changes that. But since the tip was received before the policy was announced, and the owners allowed the author to keep it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The owners might have handled this by requiring the tip to be shared, but they gave the author a choice. So it's a matter of personal ethics. If the author chooses to keep it, they aren't in the wrong because they were allowed to do so by the owners. However, if the author knew that sharing was expected, even in the past, then they might be in the wrong. But the story suggests that the previous policy was lenient.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
