Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but there's a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. The author got a tip from a customer, which ended up being $2k. When the owner found out, they said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share, but future tips must go into a common fund. The author is now conflicted between keeping the money for their own needs or sharing it with others.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The restaurant's policy was to not accept tips, but the owners were turning a blind eye before. Now they're enforcing it, and the author was given a choice. The owner didn't force them to share, just mentioned they can't do it in the future. So the author isn't breaking any current rules by keeping it. However, the previous employees might expect a certain distribution of tips, but the author didn't know that before. Also, the author is in a tight financial situation. \n\nBut maybe there's an unspoken expectation among waiters to split tips. However, the owners didn't enforce it, and it's now up to the author. If the author kept it without prior agreement, maybe others feel it's unfair. But the owner's statement allows them to keep it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if there's a common practice of splitting tips even when the restaurant doesn't enforce it, then the author might be wrong. But given the information, the owner gave them the choice, so the author's decision to keep it is within the owner's allowance. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
