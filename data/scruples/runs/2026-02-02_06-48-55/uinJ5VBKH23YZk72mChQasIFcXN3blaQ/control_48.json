Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received in a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there's a history where tips were sometimes given, and the management turned a blind eye. The author received a $2,000 tip from a customer, which is a significant sum. After being reported, the management now enforces a stricter policy, and the author is told they can choose to keep the tip or share it with others, but future tips must go into a common fund.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the management's response. Initially, the policy was informally ignored, but now they're enforcing it strictly. When the issue came up, the owners gave the author a choice. The author is considering keeping the tip, which is allowed under the decision made by the owners. \n\nHowever, there's a question about fairness. Even though the management said it's up to the author, there might be an unspoken expectation in the work environment to share tips in some contexts. But since the owners explicitly said it's up to the author, and the policy was changed after the tip was received, the author isn't necessarily violating any rules. They're in a situation where the policy changed, and they're given discretion. \n\nAlso, considering the financial situation mentioned (not being rich, living in a studio apartment, holidays coming up), the author's decision to keep the money for personal use could be seen as understandable. However, the other workers might feel that tips should be shared, especially in a service industry where tips can supplement income. But since the management didn't enforce sharing in this case, and the author was allowed to keep it, there's no explicit rule requiring sharing. \n\nSo, the main factors are the management's decision to let the author keep it and the lack of a formal policy requiring sharing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong based on the given information.\n"
