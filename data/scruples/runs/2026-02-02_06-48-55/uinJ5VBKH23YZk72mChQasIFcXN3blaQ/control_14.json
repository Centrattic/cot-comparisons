Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. The situation is a bit complex. The restaurant is supposed to be non-tipping, but there's a don't ask, don't tell policy, especially for celebrities. The author got a $2k tip from an NBA player, which they kept. The owners now want to enforce the no-tipping policy strictly, and the author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it. The question is whether not sharing is wrong.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping. The owners had a lenient approach before but are now enforcing it. The author didn't know if they had to share, but the owners said it's up to them. So, the author is in a gray area. The key points are the policy, the owner's current stance, and the social dynamics among the staff.\n\nThe author argues they're not rich and need the money for holidays. But the other waiters are upset, and the reporter brought it up. The question is about fairness. If the policy is now strict, and the tip was given under the previous leniency, does the author have to share? If the owner says they can keep it, maybe they aren't obligated. However, in a team setting like a restaurant, tips are often shared, so there might be an unspoken expectation. But the owner's new policy might negate that. It's a bit of a moral dilemma. Legally, if the owner allows them to keep it, they might be in the right. But socially, others might see it as selfish. The answer hinges on whether the owner's statement absolves the author of any obligation to share. If the owner says it's up to them, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
