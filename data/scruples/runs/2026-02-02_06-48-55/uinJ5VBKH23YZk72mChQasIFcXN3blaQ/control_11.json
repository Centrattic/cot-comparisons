Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a waiter who received a $2000 tip from a customer at a restaurant that officially has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant had a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, but now after someone reported the tip, the owners are cracking down. The author is being asked if they should share the tip with the other waiters, which would leave them with only $150.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though it's a \"non-tipping\" restaurant, the owners were previously okay with tips as long as they weren't questioned. Now, after the incident, they've decided to enforce the policy more strictly. The owner told the author they can choose to keep the tip, but future tips must go into a common fund. So the author is in a tricky spot because the policy is changing, and the question is whether they should share the existing tip.\n\nThe author argues that they're not rich, live in a studio apartment, and need the money for the holidays. They feel it's unfair to have to share it now when the policy was more lenient before. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to the new policy. The author is caught between their personal financial needs and the potential for being seen as selfish or a bad coworker.\n\nLegally, in many places, tips belong to the employee unless there's a clear policy stating otherwise. However, the restaurant's new policy now says that future tips must be shared, but the author received this tip before the policy change. The owner gave them the option to keep it. So if the owner allows them to keep the tip, maybe the author isn't obligated to share it. However, the owner might expect fairness, even if the policy is new.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Even if the author can legally or technically keep the tip, the other waiters might feel it's unfair. The author is in a position where they could set a precedent. If others find out they kept the tip, there might be resentment, especially if others are expected to share future tips. The owner's statement that it's up to the author implies that there's no strict rule for past tips, but maybe the author should still share out of fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know the policy was going to change. They were following the previous, unofficial policy. The owner is now applying a new rule retroactively, which might be unfair to the author. The author might not be in the wrong because they were following the existing policy at the time. Plus, the owner allowed them to keep it, so maybe it's their decision.\n\nBut maybe the author should consider the team aspect. Even if they can keep it, sharing could prevent future issues and show good faith. The author might be seen as a bad coworker if they keep it, even if they aren't technically in the wrong. The question is about whether they are \"in the wrong,\" which is more about social and moral judgment, not just legalities.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the owner allowed them to keep the tip and the policy changed after the fact. Alternatively, it could be A (in the wrong) because sharing the tip might be the fair thing to do to maintain team harmony, even if it's not required. The key point is the owner's discretion and the author's right to keep it. If the owner says it's okay, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the moral aspect is trickier. The author might be seen as selfish, but legally or according to the owner's policy, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
