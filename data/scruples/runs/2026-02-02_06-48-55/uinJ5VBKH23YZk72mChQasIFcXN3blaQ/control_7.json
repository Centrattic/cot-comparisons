Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a restaurant that has a non-tipping policy. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider several factors.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end with a non-tipping policy. The base salary for waitstaff is higher than usual, which might be part of the compensation structure. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding tips, meaning they turn a blind eye if customers leave tips. However, recently, some new waitresses have complained, leading the owners to enforce the policy more strictly. The author received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer, and when this was discovered, there was a meeting where the owners stated that future tips must be turned into a common fund. The author is now deciding whether to keep the $2k or share it with others.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is obligated to share the tip. The owners didn't enforce the policy before, so there was a sort of informal agreement. But now, after the incident, the owners have clarified the policy. They allowed the author to keep the tip but said that future tips must be pooled. The author is conflicted because keeping the money would mean they profit from a situation that's now changing, while sharing would leave them with significantly less, which is a big hit for them personally.\n\nLegally, in some places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff, but if the establishment has a non-tipping policy and the owner allowed the tip to be kept in this case, that might override the usual rules. The author might not be in the wrong if the owner gave them discretion. However, there's a moral aspect too. The waitress who reported the tip might feel that the policy should be enforced retroactively, but the owners didn't hold the author to that. Since the author was given the choice, they might have the right to keep it. But others might argue that fairness requires sharing, especially if others had similar situations before.\n\nThe answer hinges on the policy the owner presented. Since the owner allowed the author to keep it and changed the policy going forward, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing past tips. The new policy affects future tips, not past ones. So the author's decision to keep the $2k, given the owner's statement, is within their rights. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
