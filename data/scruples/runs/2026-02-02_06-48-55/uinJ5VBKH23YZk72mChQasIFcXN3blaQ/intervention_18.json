Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. So when the author gets a $2000 tip from a customer, it's not part of the official policy. The owners then decide to enforce the policy more strictly after someone reports it. They mention that any future tips must be shared, but for past ones, it's up to the individual to decide whether to keep or share.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they're not rich and need the money, especially with holidays coming up. The question is whether it's wrong to keep the tip.\n\nI need to consider the restaurant's policy. Since the owners previously had a don't-ask-don't-tell policy, but now they're enforcing a strict no-tipping rule, maybe they didn't have a clear system for existing tips. The author argues that they weren't told to share past tips, so they kept it. However, the waitress who reported them is now pushing for sharing.\n\nIn some places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff, especially in non-tipping situations where the service charge is pooled. But in this case, the restaurant is high-end with higher base salaries, and the policy was ambiguous. The key point is that the owners said it's up to the individual whether to keep the tip. So technically, the author isn't violating any new policy by keeping it.\n\nBut there's a social aspect. The other waiters might feel it's unfair since the policy is now changing, and the author got to keep a large amount while others might have past tips that could also be claimed. However, the owners didn't enforce sharing for everyone, just saying the author can decide.\n\nThe author is in a vulnerable position, living in a studio apartment and needing the money. The owners gave them the choice, so maybe it's not technically wrong. But there's an ethical consideration about fairness. However, since the owners allowed it, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
