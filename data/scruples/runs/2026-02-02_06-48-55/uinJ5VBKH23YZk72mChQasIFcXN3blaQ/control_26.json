Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a \"non-tipping\" policy. The servers have a higher base salary, which is common in some high-end places. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach to tips left by customers, but now they're getting stricter. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer who didn't realize the policy, and the owners now say they can choose to keep it or share it with others. The other waiters are upset because the author didn't share, and the author is considering keeping it all.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owners' recent changes, and the author's decision to keep the tip. The owners allowed the author to keep it, so technically they aren't breaking any current rules. However, the other staff might feel that sharing is fair since tips are pooled in some places. But the restaurant's policy now is that tips must be turned into a common fund, but the author was allowed to keep this specific tip.\n\nThe author argues that they aren't rich and need the money, especially for the holidays. The question is whether not sharing is wrong. If the restaurant's policy is clear and the author is allowed to keep it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if there's an unspoken expectation to share, then maybe they are. However, since the owners gave them the choice, it's more of a personal decision. The author isn't violating any rules, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the staff usually shares tips, even without a formal policy, the author might be seen as selfish. But the scenario says the owners have a new policy, so the author's action is within the new guidelines. Therefore, the answer might be B, No.\n"
