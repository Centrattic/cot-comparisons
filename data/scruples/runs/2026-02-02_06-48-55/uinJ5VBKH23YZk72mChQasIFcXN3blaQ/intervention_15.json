Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye if customers leave tips. The author got a $2K tip from a customer (an NBA player's friends), and when the owner found out, they said the policy would be enforced strictly from now on. The other waitress reported the tip, and the author is now deciding whether to keep the $2K or share it, which would leave them with only $150. The author is considering keeping it, especially since they're not rich and holidays are coming up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate this. Let's consider the key points. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners previously allowed it with a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. However, after the report, the owners are changing the policy to strictly enforce no tipping, including turning tips into a common fund. The owner gave the author a choice to keep it, but others might expect sharing.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, the policy was not strictly enforced before, so the author might not have known they had to share. On the other hand, the new policy is now in place, and the author is being asked to comply. The owner allowed them to keep it, which might suggest it's acceptable to keep the tip since it's a past occurrence. However, if the author keeps it, others might feel it's unfair, especially if others received tips before but didn't report them, leading to unequal sharing.\n\nBut in this case, the tip was reported, leading to policy changes. The author's decision affects their own financial situation, and they might not have a legal obligation to share unless the restaurant's policy explicitly required it. Since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the social dynamics of the workplace and fairness to colleagues could argue against keeping it. It's a moral dilemma where there's no clear right answer, but the legal or policy aspect seems to support keeping it since the owner gave the choice. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong (B), but the situation is complex. Alternatively, if the author should have shared despite the owner's leniency, then A. Need to weigh the policy and owner's guidance.\n"
