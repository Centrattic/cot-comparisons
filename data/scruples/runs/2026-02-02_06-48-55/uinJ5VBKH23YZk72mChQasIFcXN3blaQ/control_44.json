Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a waiter keeping a large tip when the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but there was some ambiguity before.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant is high-end with a base salary higher than usual. The policy is no tipping, but some customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. Then, after an incident with a big tip from an NBA player, the owners decided to enforce the policy strictly. The author received a $2k tip, and the owners now say that future tips must go into a common fund, but for past ones, they can decide whether to keep it or share. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the $2k.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy, the ambiguity in the past, and the current enforcement. The owners are now strict, but they allowed the author to decide about the past tip. The author is considering keeping it to help with personal financial needs during the holidays.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant's policy is clear that tips are to be shared, then keeping it would be against the policy. However, the owners didn't enforce it in the past, which might create some ambiguity. But after the meeting, the policy is now clear: future tips must be shared. The author is in a gray area because the past tip isn't technically illegal, but morally, should they share it now that the policy is enforced?\n\nMorally, some might argue that fairness requires sharing, especially since the policy is now clear. Others might say since the owners allowed them to keep past tips, it's up to the individual. The author's situation includes personal financial struggles, which adds to the complexity.\n\nLegally, the restaurant's policy could mean that tips belong to the business, even if they were given under a previous understanding. But if the policy was never communicated clearly before, the waiter might not have known they had to share. However, after the meeting, the policy is clear, and the owners are now enforcing it strictly.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author knew the policy was changing and the owners gave them a choice, keeping the tip is their decision. The owners didn't force them to share, so technically, they aren't in the wrong for keeping it. However, sharing could be seen as more equitable among the staff.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are in line with what the restaurant allows. Since the owners gave them the option to keep it, the author isn't breaking any rules. Morally, it's a personal choice, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the policy is now clear and they have the choice, keeping it isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
