Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, which is enforced with a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The staff has a higher base salary, which is common in non-tipping places. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player's $10,000 total (since the bill was $8,000 and tip was $2,000). The owner let them decide whether to keep it or share it, but the author is considering keeping it all. The other waiters are upset, and the policy is now being enforced more strictly.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The owner allowed them to keep it, but the author is choosing not to share. The key here is the restaurant's policy and the social dynamics among the staff. \n\nThe restaurant's policy is non-tipping, so tips are supposed to be turned into a common fund. The owner might have a point in saying that in the future, tips must be shared, but in this specific case, they gave the author a choice. The author's decision to keep the tip is a personal one, but others might feel it's unfair since the policy is now being enforced more strictly, and the author might be seen as taking advantage of the old policy.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the owner allowed the author to keep the tip, but others are now being told that future tips must be shared, the author might be seen as benefiting from a loophole. However, the owner explicitly gave them the choice. The author's argument is that they need the money, especially during the holidays. \n\nEthically, if the restaurant has a policy where tips are shared, even if it was previously lax, then the author is within their rights if the owner allowed it. But if the staff expects a more communal approach, the author might be seen as selfish. However, the owner's words are key here. Since they said it's up to the author to decide, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the staff might feel betrayed, which complicates things.\n\nI think the answer depends on the restaurant's policy and the owner's instructions. Since the owner gave the author the choice, and the policy is now stricter moving forward, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the author might be considered in the wrong if the staff collective felt that tips should be shared regardless, even if the owner allowed it. But the owner's decision to let the author keep it suggests it's acceptable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
