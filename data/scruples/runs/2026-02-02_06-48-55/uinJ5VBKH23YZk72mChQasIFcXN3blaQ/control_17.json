Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a tip in a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy, but sometimes customers leave tips anyway. The owner has a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. The author gets a $2000 tip from a customer, but another waitress reports it. The owners then enforce the policy strictly from now on. The author is now deciding whether to keep the tip or share it, with the owners saying it's up to them but future tips must be pooled.\n\nSo the key points here are: the existing policy, the owner's past tolerance vs. new strictness, and the author's decision to keep the money. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping it.\n\nI need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the policy was never explicitly enforced before, and the owner turned a blind eye, then the author might not have known they had to share. Now that the policy is being enforced, the owners are making a new rule. But for past actions, the owner gave the author discretion. \n\nThe author argues they're not rich, need the money for holidays, and the others are getting strict. The other waitress reported the tip, which led to the strict policy. The author is being asked to share, but if they didn't know the policy was going to change, is it fair to expect them to share now?\n\nAlso, the owner said it's up to the author whether to keep the previous tip. So legally or by the new policy, the author could keep it. But morally, is the author in the wrong for not sharing? \n\nMaybe the author is in the right because the policy changed after the fact. If the restaurant only now decided to enforce the policy, the author didn't have prior knowledge. Also, the owner gave them the choice. So keeping it might not be wrong. On the flip side, others might argue that since the policy was in place, the author should have shared from the start, even if it wasn't enforced before. But since the owner allowed it before, maybe the author isn't wrong now.\n\nAnother angle: the author worked the shift and received the tip. If the tip wasn't part of the restaurant's policy, and the customer gave it directly to the author, maybe it's their to keep unless specified otherwise. However, the new common fund suggests that future tips are pooled, but past ones are grandfathered. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the policy was not enforced previously, and the owners gave them the choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
