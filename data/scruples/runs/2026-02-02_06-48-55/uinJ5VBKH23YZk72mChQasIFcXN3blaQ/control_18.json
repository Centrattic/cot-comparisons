Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a policy against tipping, but the owners turned a blind eye before. The author got a $2,000 tip from a wealthy customer, and now the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The other workers are upset, and the author is considering keeping the tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners have a strict no-tipping policy now, but in the past, they allowed tips to be kept. The author received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners told the author they can keep it, but future tips will be shared. So the key point here is whether the author is bound by a new policy that was implemented after the tip was already given.\n\nThen, the question of fairness. The other waiters were upset because they didn't get the tip. But the author received the tip under the previous, more lenient policy. The owners' response was that it's up to the author to keep it. So, if the policy changed after the fact, the author isn't obligated to share it now. However, some might argue that since the restaurant is a team, sharing tips is standard practice, even if it wasn't enforced before.\n\nAlso, the author mentions financial struggles. Keeping the tip could help with upcoming holidays, which adds context. But others might say that in a restaurant setting, tips are traditionally shared among staff, especially if the policy is a communal fund. However, the previous policy allowed keeping tips, so the author might feel justified.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal aspect. If the restaurant has a policy that tips are shared, then legally, the author might have to share. But if the policy was non-existent or lenient before, and the owners allowed it, the author could argue it's their money. The owners' statement that they can keep it supports that.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they kept the tip under the old policy. The new policy doesn't retroactively apply to past tips. Plus, the owners gave them the choice to keep it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
