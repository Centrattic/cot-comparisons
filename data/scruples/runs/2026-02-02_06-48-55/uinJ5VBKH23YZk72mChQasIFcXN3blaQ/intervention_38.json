Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The person works at a non-tipping restaurant where the policy is to not accept tips, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The person received a $2000 tip from a customer, kept it, and now the owners are enforcing a stricter policy. The question is whether they are in the wrong for keeping the tip instead of sharing it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The restaurant claims it's non-tipping, but the owners previously allowed tips as a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. However, after the incident, the owners changed the policy to require tips to be turned into a common fund. In this case, the person was told they could keep the tip they already had, but future tips would be pooled. The other waiters argued for splitting the existing tip, but the person chose not to.\n\nThe key points here are: the restaurant's policy, the owners' enforcement, and the person's decision. The owners didn't require sharing the tip, they just said future tips would be pooled. So technically, the person was given the choice to keep it. However, other waiters might feel it's unfair since they weren't getting a chance to share in the existing tips. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, even if the policy was changed, the existing tip was received under the old policy. The owners allowed the person to keep it, so maybe there's no obligation to share. On the other hand, the person might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if others are expecting a share. But the owners didn't enforce sharing, so maybe the person isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the person was obligated to share. Since the owners didn't make it mandatory, and the policy was changed after the fact, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, from a moral standpoint, sharing could be seen as the right thing. But legally or according to the restaurant's rules, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
