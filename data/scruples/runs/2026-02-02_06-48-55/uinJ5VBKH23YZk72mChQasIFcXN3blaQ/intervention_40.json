Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip with their fellow waiters. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but there's been a sort of unofficial understanding where the management doesn't enforce it strictly. The writer received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer, and after the policy was enforced more strictly, they're being asked to share the money or face criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, but after the new waitresses complained, they changed the policy to strictly no tipping. The writer now has to decide whether to keep the tip they already received or share it. The owners said it's up to them, but the writer is considering keeping it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant's policy is clear and they've changed it to require tips to be pooled, the writer might be in a bind. However, since the policy was recently enforced, and the tip was given before the new rules, there's ambiguity. The owners allowed the previous practice but now are changing the rules. The writer's situation is a bit of a gray area because they didn't know the new policy at the time they received the tip.\n\nEthically, if the restaurant is now enforcing a policy where tips must be shared, the writer could be expected to comply, even with retroactive application. But if the previous policy was not enforced, there's an argument that the writer wasn't aware they had to share it. The writer is in a tough spot because they're being asked to share money they received under old rules.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they're not rich, live in a studio apartment, and need the money for the holidays. They also don't want to be a \"terrible person.\" The key issue is whether the new policy applies retroactively. If the owners are now enforcing the rule, even for past tips, the writer is in a morally ambiguous position. However, if the policy change is only for the future, and the tip was received before the new rule, then keeping it might be justified.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the community looks at both the letter of the law and the spirit. The restaurant's owners made a sudden policy change after complaints from other staff, which might reflect poorly on them. The writer might feel unfairly targeted since the policy wasn't clear before. On the other hand, the writer could be seen as benefiting from a situation where the rules were unclear and now refusing to share when the policy is enforced.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the writer is expected to share the tip they received under the old, more lenient policy. If the new policy is applied retroactively, the writer might be in the wrong for not sharing. If not, they might not be. However, given that the owners allowed the previous practice and now are enforcing a strict rule, but still let the writer keep the tip, it's more of a \"nope\" scenario because the writer isn't obligated to share under the old rules. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
