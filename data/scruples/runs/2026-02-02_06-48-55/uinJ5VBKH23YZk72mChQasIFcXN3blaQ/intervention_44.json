Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for keeping a $2000 tip instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye in the past. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, which they kept. Now, the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly, and there's a discussion about sharing tips if someone gets one.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy and the expectations of the staff. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the tip, but others might expect sharing since the previous policy was a \"don't ask, don't tell.\" However, the owners are now strict, which might mean that any future tips will be split, but the past one is a gray area.\n\nThe author argues they are not rich and need the money, especially with upcoming holidays. They don't want to be a terrible person. The question is about their moral obligation versus the policy.\n\nLegally, if the policy is clear and tips are supposed to be pooled, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the previous policy allowed keeping tips, it's more of a gray area. However, since the owners now say they can choose to keep it, maybe there's a loophole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, fairness is a factor. If the staff expects shared tips, keeping it could be seen as unfair. However, if the previous policy allowed it, maybe it's not the author's fault. The fact that the owner allowed them to keep it now but wants stricter enforcement in the future complicates things.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the existing policy at the time of receiving the tip allowed keeping it. If the owners said it's up to them, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the previous understanding was that tips would be shared, then they are. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I think considering the new policy and the owners' statement, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, the fact that others might expect sharing in a group setting where tips are pooled could tip it towards AITA. But the owners' permission to keep it might absolve them. Hmm.\n"
