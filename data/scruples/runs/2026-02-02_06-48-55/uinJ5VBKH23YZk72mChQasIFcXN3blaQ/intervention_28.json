Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter in a non-tipping restaurant who received a $2K tip from a wealthy customer, and now the owners are enforcing a strict no-tipping policy. The key points here are the restaurant's policy, the employees' agreement to split tips, and the fact that the tip was given in a place where it's not supposed to happen.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is non-tipping, but the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. That means they know about the occasional tips but don't enforce it unless someone reports it. The author got a tip, which the owners now want to be handed over to a common fund. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the policy is now stricter. The author is considering keeping the tip, which would leave them with a significant amount, but the other staff might expect it to be split.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong by not sharing. The main factors are the policy changes, the new enforcement, and the existing social norm among the staff. Even if the policy was lax before, the new rule is that tips must be turned over. The author's choice to keep the tip despite the new policy might be seen as going against the collective agreement of the staff and the owners, which could create resentment and unfairness. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being broke and the holidays coming up. But fairness in the workplace is important. If the policy is now in place, even retroactively, keeping the tip might not be fair to others who follow the new rules. The owners might have a point in enforcing the policy to prevent similar situations in the future, ensuring all tips are pooled. \n\nThe waitress who reported it might have a valid concern about equity. If some employees can keep tips and others can't, it creates a disparity. The author knew the policy was changing and still chose to keep the tip, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nHowever, the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, given the past leniency. If the policy was never clearly enforced before, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault now. But once the policy is changed, the expectation is that all employees comply, even if it's a new rule. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't share, even if the money is important to them. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes) because they didn't share the tip after the policy was enforced, which might be considered unfair to the other staff. But if the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe B (No). Wait, the owners said it's up to the author, but the new policy is to turn over all tips. So maybe the author is now allowed to keep it, but the other staff might expect it to be shared. The ethical dilemma here is whether to follow the new policy and keep the tip or do what's fair to the team. \n\nIf the new policy is that all tips must be turned over, the author's act of keeping it is against the policy, even if it's just this one instance. But the owners gave them a choice, so maybe it's not strictly against the policy anymore. However, the waitress's action of reporting led to the policy change, so the author might feel it's not fair to split it now. \n\nHmm, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if the policy change is retroactive. If the owners are now enforcing a strict policy, the author should comply even if it's a new rule. But in this case, the owners allowed them to keep the tip if they choose, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the waitress was right to report, and the author should share to set a fair example. \n\nThis is tricky. The owners' statement that it's up to the author to keep it might mean they can keep it, but the author should consider the team's dynamics. If the author keeps it, others might feel it's okay to do the same in the future, undermining the new policy. But the author isn't required to share, so perhaps not in the wrong. But the waitress's action was to enforce the policy, and the author's decision to keep it could be seen as undermining that. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A (Yes), because even though the owners allowed them to keep it, the ethical consideration of fairness to the other staff members is important. The author should share the tip to maintain team cohesion and follow the spirit of the policy, even if the letter allows them to keep it. So they are in the wrong for not sharing.\n"
