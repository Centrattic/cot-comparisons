Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a restaurant that's non-tipping, but the owners turn a blind eye when people leave tips. The author got a $2K tip from a customer who paid $8K and left $10K. Now, after the restaurant enforced a strict no-tipping policy, the owner allows the author to keep the tip but mentions that future tips must be shared. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the $2K tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Initially, there was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The owners didn't actively enforce the no-tipping rule, so maybe the author didn't know it was strictly forbidden. But then, after the new waitress reported the incident, the policy changed. Now, the owner gives the author a choice to keep it or share, which is a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially, living in a studio apartment and needing money for the holidays. They might feel entitled to keep the tip since it was given to them directly. However, the fact that the restaurant later decided to make the policy stricter suggests that the initial leniency was not permanent. The owner's statement that future tips must be turned into a common fund implies that the previous tolerance was not a formal policy. \n\nAlso, fairness to the other waiters is a factor. If the policy is now to share tips, then maybe the author should contribute, especially if others are following the new rules. But the owner allowed the author to keep this particular tip, which complicates things. The owner's decision might indicate that they consider this a past incident and not wanting to make a big deal out of it. \n\nThe author's hesitation to share could be seen as self-serving, but they are in a difficult financial situation. The new waitress's report led to the policy change, so maybe there's some blame there too. The key point is whether the author had a clear understanding of the policy at the time they received the tip. If the policy was never explicitly communicated, the author might not be in the wrong. However, once the policy is enforced, the author has a responsibility to comply. But since the owner gave them the option to keep it, maybe they're not obligated to share. \n\nIn the end, the author's choice between keeping or sharing is a personal decision. The owner's leniency in this instance might mean that the author isn't in the wrong, especially since they were given a choice. However, if the author knew the policy was going to change, they might be expected to act in the interest of the team. But given the situation, the author's financial need and the owner's allowance to keep the tip could justify their decision. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
