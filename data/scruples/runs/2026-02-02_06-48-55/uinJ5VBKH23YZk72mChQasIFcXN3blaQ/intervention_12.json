Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing a $2000 tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. The restaurant has a high base salary, and the policy is no tips, but some customers still leave them. The owners sort of ignored it before, but now they're enforcing a stricter policy. The person got a huge tip from an NBA player, and when others found out, the owners said they could keep it, but future tips would be pooled. The question is whether keeping the $2000 is wrong.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners allowed it before. Now they're changing the policy, which is their prerogative. The person in question received the tip before the policy change was enforced. The owners told them they could keep it. So legally, maybe they have a right to keep it. But ethically, it's a gray area. The other waiters might feel it's unfair if the policy was supposed to be enforced retroactively. However, the owners didn't make that clear until after the fact. The person didn't know they had to share it at the time they received it. They were following the previous \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. \n\nThe person is in a tough spot financially and might not be able to share. But others might argue that since the policy is now strict, everyone should share future tips. But this was a past tip. The owners didn't make it clear that past tips needed to be pooled. So maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they were following the old policy. But if the new policy applies retroactively, maybe they should share. However, the owners didn't explicitly say that. They just said they could keep it but future ones would be pooled. So the person has a choice. \n\nEthically, if others found out and the new policy is about sharing, maybe the person should share for the sake of team harmony. But legally or by company policy, they might not have to. The answer might depend on whether the company's policy was clear. Since the owners allowed it before and now are changing, the person might be in the right to keep it. Alternatively, if the new policy applies retroactively, they should share. But the owners didn't specify that. So the person is not in the wrong for keeping it. Answer B.\n"
