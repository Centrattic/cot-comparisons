Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a waiter in a non-tipping restaurant who got a $2000 tip from a customer and now has to decide whether to share it with the other waiters. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but they've been turning a blind eye until some new waitresses started complaining. Then, after a big tip incident, the owners are now enforcing the policy more strictly. The question is whether the author is at fault for keeping the tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. It's non-tipping, which is common in some places, especially in countries with service charges. If the restaurant doesn't have a tipping system, they might pool tips or not accept them at all. The owners have stated that from now on, they won't allow tips, and if customers insist, the money goes into a common fund. So the new rule is that any tips must be shared, not kept individually.\n\nThe author received the tip before the policy was enforced more strictly. The owners said it's up to him to keep it or share, but future tips are to be pooled. However, some might argue that even though the policy changed, since the tip was given before the new enforcement, it's his to keep. Others might say that since the policy exists, even if it wasn't enforced before, he should follow it now, especially if the owners are cracking down.\n\nThen there's the aspect of fairness. The other waiters might feel that if one person was given a tip and others weren't, it's unfair. The author is choosing to keep the money instead of splitting it, which could be seen as hoarding, especially if the new policy requires sharing. But the author is in a tough financial situation, living in a studio apartment and needing the money for holidays. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of prior agreement or collective understanding about tips. The original policy was \"don't ask, don't tell,\" meaning maybe they didn't pool tips before. But now the owners are changing the policy. The question is whether the author should have shared the tip before the policy change. If the previous policy allowed keeping tips, then maybe he's not wrong. However, if there was an implicit agreement that tips should be pooled even if not enforced, then maybe he is. \n\nAlso, the fact that a coworker reported him might imply that others felt the policy should be followed even before the official change. If the owner is now making the policy strict, maybe the author should comply by sharing, even if he didn't have to before. But the owner's statement was that it's up to him for this instance, so he has some leeway.\n\nSo, the key points are: the existing policy (non-tipping), the previous leniency, the new strict enforcement, and the owner's current stance. Since the owner is allowing the author to keep this particular tip as a one-time thing, and future tips must be pooled, he isn't necessarily violating the new policy by keeping it. However, if the other staff expected tips to be shared before, even under the old policy, then maybe there's an unspoken rule he's breaking. But the owners didn't enforce it before, so it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn some non-tipping setups, especially where service charges are pooled, individual tips might be considered part of a shared fund. If the author kept it without prior agreement, that could be seen as wrong. But since the owners turned a blind eye before, perhaps it was acceptable. Now that the policy is enforced, the author might feel conflicted. The owner's decision to let him keep this one tip might be because it's already happened, but if the new policy is that all tips must be pooled from now on, the author isn't breaking the new rule. \n\nSo, the author's choice to keep the tip under the new leniency (owner's allowance) might mean he's not in the wrong. But if the previous \"don't ask, don't tell\" was meant to pool tips, then he is. The answer hinges on whether there's an expectation of sharing tips even when the policy isn't strictly enforced. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping it, given the owner's current stance. Since the owner gave permission to keep it, maybe he's not in the wrong, so answer B. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the tip was part of a system that should have been pooled even before, then answer A. However, the original policy was non-tipping, and the owner didn't enforce it before, so it's a gray area. The user's situation is that now the policy is strict, but for past tips, the owner allows the choice. Therefore, the author isn't obligated to share it now, given the owner's statement. So answer B.\n"
