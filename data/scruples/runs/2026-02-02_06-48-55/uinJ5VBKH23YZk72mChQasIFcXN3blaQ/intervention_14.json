Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye in the past. The author got a $2k tip from a high-profile customer, which the owners now say they have to report to the common fund if someone insists. But in this case, the owners told the author they can keep it, but future tips have to be pooled. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the policy was enforced more strictly.\n\nThe author is conflicted: they want to keep the money for their own needs (like holidays) but feel guilty about not sharing. The question is whether they are in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owner's stance post-incident, and the social contract with coworkers. The owners allowed the author to keep this specific tip, but future ones must be pooled. However, the other waitress reported it, which led to the policy being enforced. The author might feel that since they were given the option to keep this one, they are within their rights. But others might argue that the policy is now strict, and the author should follow it to be fair. Also, there's an ethical angle about sharing with colleagues, especially if the policy is meant to be fair. But the author is in a financial hardship, so personal responsibility comes into play.\n\nThe owner's statement says it's up to the author to keep it, but the author is aware that others are upset. If the author keeps it, are they violating the spirit of the policy? The policy was changed to prevent future tips from being kept, but this one was an exception. The author might be in a gray area. However, the owner gave them the choice, so legally or according to the new policy, maybe they can keep it. Ethically, if the rest of the staff is supposed to share, but they were allowed to keep this one, maybe it's not their fault. But maybe the author should have shared it as a gesture of goodwill despite the owner's permission.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. The owner's words are crucial. If the owner allowed them to keep it, then technically, they aren't breaking any rules. However, the social aspect of keeping the tip might make others feel unfair. But the author's situation is tough. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the owner permitted it. But if the author should have shared even if not required, then A.\n"
