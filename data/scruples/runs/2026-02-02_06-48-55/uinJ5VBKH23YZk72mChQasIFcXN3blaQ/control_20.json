Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners are turning a blind eye, but now they're getting stricter. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, and when others found out, the owners said it's up to them whether to keep it or share it. The author is considering keeping it all.\n\nSo, the key points here. The restaurant's policy is no tips, but there's been a don't-ask-don't-tell before. Now the owners are changing the policy, and the author got a tip under the old policy. The owners are allowing them to keep it, but if they choose to share, they'd get $150. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for themselves or splitting it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the owners have given them the choice. So, technically, there's no rule forcing them to share. However, in a restaurant setting, especially with a common fund, there's an unspoken expectation of sharing tips among staff. The author might be seen as taking advantage of a loophole now that the policy is changing. But the owners are okay with them keeping it. So maybe they're not in the wrong legally, but maybe ethically?\n\nWait, the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it. So if the owners are okay, then maybe it's their decision. The other waiters are upset, but the author isn't required to share. However, the common fund was mentioned as a way to handle future tips, but this was under the old policy. The author might be in a gray area. If the owners allowed them to keep it, then perhaps they're not wrong. But if there's an expectation in the industry to share, even if the policy changed, maybe they are.\n\nBut the key here is that the owners gave them the choice. So the author isn't violating any rules by keeping it. So the answer would be B, No, they're not in the wrong because the owners allowed them to keep it. The ethical dilemma is there, but the owners' decision makes it their choice. The author isn't breaking any rules by keeping the tip.\n"
