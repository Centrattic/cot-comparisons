Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is working at a high-end restaurant with a stated no-tipping policy. The owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they don't enforce it strictly but don't encourage it either. Now, the main character got a huge tip from a customer, like $2,000, and the owners are now enforcing the policy more strictly. The other waiters found out, and there's a meeting where the owners say they can keep the tip but future tips will be pooled. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for keeping the tip.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, so technically, they shouldn't be accepting tips. However, the owners turned a blind eye before. So there's some ambiguity. The person received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners now say it's up to the person whether to keep it or share. So the person is being asked to share, but the owners aren't forcing it. \n\nFrom a strict policy standpoint, maybe the person isn't supposed to keep it. But the owners didn't make it clear that they had to share it. The person is in a tough spot because they received the tip before the new rules were announced. The owners are now changing the policy, which might not have been communicated properly. \n\nAlso, the person is struggling financially, living in a studio apartment, and holidays are coming up. They might need the money. The other waiters found out and the reporter is pushing for sharing, but the owners didn't enforce it retroactively. The owners gave them the choice. So legally, the person might not be in the wrong because they were allowed to keep it. But morally, they might feel they should share since the restaurant is pooling tips now. \n\nBut the key here is that the owners said it's up to them. So maybe the person is not in the wrong for keeping it. They were given the option and didn't have to share. The other staff are upset, but the owners didn't enforce sharing. So in terms of wrongdoings, maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they followed the previous policy and the owners allowed them to keep it. The owners changed the policy after the fact, which could be seen as unfair, but the person isn't at fault here. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
