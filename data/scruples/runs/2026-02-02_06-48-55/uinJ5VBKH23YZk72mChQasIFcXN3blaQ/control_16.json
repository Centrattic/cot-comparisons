Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with their fellow waiters. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy. The owners are aware of occasional tips but have a sort of don't ask, don't tell policy. Then, the author receives a tip from an NBA player, which is reported by a coworker. The owners then enforce a stricter policy, and the author is told they can keep the tip but others might not be allowed to keep future tips. Now, the author is considering keeping the money, but the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the restaurant's policy, the owners' stance, and the author's decision. The policy is against tipping, but in the past, there was leniency. Now, the owners are cracking down. The author was given the choice to keep the tip because it happened before the new policy was enforced. \n\nThe other waiters are upset, but the author is in a tight financial situation. The question is about fairness and the restaurant's rules. The owners didn't force the author to share it, so technically, the author isn't violating any new rules by keeping it. However, there's a social expectation or a sense of fairness among the staff. \n\nBut the owners made it clear that in this specific instance, the author can keep the tip. Since the new policy is for future tips, the $2,000 is from before the policy change. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the owners allowed them to keep it. Also, the author mentions their financial struggles, which adds context about their need for the money.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the money should be shared since tips in a restaurant are traditionally for service, and splitting them is customary. However, this is a \"non-tipping\" place, and the policy wasn't clear until after the tip was given. The author wasn't informed of a policy requiring sharing the tip at the time it was received.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't violating any explicit rules set by the owners after the fact. The owners gave them the choice, so keeping it isn't wrong under the new policy. The moral aspect is subjective, but the question is about being in the wrong, which relates more to rules and fairness. The author isn't breaking any rules, so the answer would be B.\n"
