Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about tips in a restaurant where the policy is non-tipping, but there's been some ambiguity. The author received a $2000 tip, and now the owners are enforcing a strict policy. The question is whether the author should keep the tip or share it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is non-tipping, so the base salary is higher. That's a common setup where tips are either prohibited or pooled. The owner's policy was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, but now it's stricter. The author got the tip before the policy change, but the owners are now asking whether to share it. \n\nThe key points here are the existing policy and the owner's new stance. If the owner said it's up to the author to decide whether to keep it, but the new policy is that future tips must be shared, the author is in a gray area. They received the tip before the policy was enforced, but now the owners are asking them to comply with the new rules. \n\nThe author is struggling because keeping the entire tip would mean not sharing with others, which could be seen as unfair if others are also affected. But the author is also in a tough financial situation. However, the owners' new policy requires that future tips go into a common fund. If the author keeps the tip, they're essentially benefiting from the old, lax policy, which might not be fair to others who followed the new rules. \n\nEven though the owner allows the author to keep it, there's an ethical question about whether they should. The waitress who reported it was following the new policy, so maybe the author should share the tip as a goodwill gesture, especially since the owner is now strict about it. But the owner's statement that it's up to the author might mean they don't want to penalize them for past actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the restaurant's policy is that tips should be pooled, then keeping the tip goes against that, even if it's allowed now. However, the owner's decision to let them decide might mean they aren't in the wrong. It's a bit of a tricky situation. \n\nI think the ethical stance here is that since the policy is for tips to be shared, even if received before the enforcement, it's better to comply. The author is in a position to choose to share, which would be more morally correct, even if they're not legally obligated. So, the author might be in the wrong if they keep it, but the owner's leniency complicates that.\n"
