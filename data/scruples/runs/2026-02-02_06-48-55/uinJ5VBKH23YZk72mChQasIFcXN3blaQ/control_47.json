Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. Now, the owners are cracking down and there's a new policy that any tips must go into a common fund. The author got a $2k tip, and the other waiters want to split it, but the author is considering keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but they've allowed it informally before. Now the policy is changing, and the owners are enforcing it. The author received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, but they won't accept tips in the future. The other waiters are upset because they want to share the tip, but the author is thinking of keeping it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the policy was non-tipping, but the owners didn't enforce it strictly before. The author didn't know the policy was going to change. The tip was given before the new policy was announced. The owners allowed the author to keep it, so technically, there's no rule broken. However, the other waiters are now expected to pool tips. But the author's tip was before the policy change. The owners didn't force the author to share it; they just announced the new policy. The author is in a position where they can choose to keep the tip or share. Since they were allowed to keep it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the owner's statement that it's up to the author might create a precedent where others might keep tips too, which could lead to unfairness. But the author's actions were in compliance with the previous informal policy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The owners allowed them to keep the tip, and the new policy affects future tips, not past ones. The author's decision to keep it is within the bounds of the previous understanding, even if it's unfair to others. But maybe there's a moral obligation to share, but the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about policy violation. Since the owners didn't enforce sharing in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
