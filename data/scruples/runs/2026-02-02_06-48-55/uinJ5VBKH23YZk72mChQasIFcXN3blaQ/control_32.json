Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing the tip. The scenario is that the restaurant is a non-tipping place, but there's been a sort of unofficial policy where tips are allowed sometimes. The author got a $2000 tip, and now the owners are cracking down. The other waiters want the tip shared, but the author is considering keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the established rules. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners were turning a blind eye before. Now they've decided to enforce the policy strictly. The author's situation happened before this change. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the tip or share it. \n\nThe key points here are the company's policy and the employees' expectations. Since the policy was non-tipping, any tips given should technically go to the restaurant or a shared fund. However, the previous policy was more lenient, so maybe the author thought it was okay. But now that the policy is being enforced, the author is being asked to share the tip. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they need the money for holidays, but the others feel it's unfair they didn't share. The owners allowed the author to keep it, but the author is conflicted.\n\nI think the wrongness here depends on the company's policy. Since the restaurant explicitly stated a no-tipping policy, even if it was loosely enforced, the tips should be for the restaurant or a common fund. The author took the tip before the policy changed, but the owners now say it's their choice. However, in a non-tipping restaurant, tips aren't part of the employees' earnings, so keeping it might be against the policy. The fact that others are upset because they didn't get the same opportunity suggests that sharing is expected. So the author might be in the wrong for keeping it, as the policy is clear, even if the enforcement changed. Alternatively, since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the main point is the policy existed, so the tip should be considered the restaurant's money. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not sharing it.\n"
