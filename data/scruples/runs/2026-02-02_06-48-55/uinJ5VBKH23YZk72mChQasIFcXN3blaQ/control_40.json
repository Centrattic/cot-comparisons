Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a waiter in a non-tipping restaurant who got a $2,000 tip from a customer. The restaurant has a policy against tipping, but they've been turning a blind eye. Now the owner is cracking down, and the waiter has to decide whether to keep the tip or share it with others.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but they allowed it before. The owners are now making it clear that tips have to go into a common fund. The person in question got a tip before the policy change, but after the meeting, they have to decide if they should share it now that the rules are stricter.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The restaurant's existing policy, 2) Whether the tip was given under the previous \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, and 3) The new rule requiring tips to be pooled. The person got the tip when the policy was still somewhat flexible. Now that the policy is being enforced strictly, they have to decide whether to keep the tip they already received.\n\nThe owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share. But the author is considering keeping it because they need the money, especially for upcoming holidays. The other waiters are upset because they were told about it and want the tip shared. The question is if the author is in the wrong by not sharing.\n\nLegally, if the tip was given before the policy changed, maybe the author has a right to keep it. But ethically, since the new policy requires future tips to be pooled, maybe the existing tip should be shared as part of the common fund. However, the owners didn't make it mandatory; they left it up to the author. So if the author chooses to keep it, they might not be in the wrong because the owners allowed it. On the other hand, if the new policy is meant to ensure fairness, then keeping the tip might be seen as selfish.\n\nBut the restaurant's stance was \"don't ask, don't tell\" before. The author didn't know it was against the rules to accept it, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The new policy is about future tips, not past ones. So the author might argue that the tip was given under the old policy and they're not obligated to share it now. However, the other staff might feel it's unfair that one person got to keep a large tip while others have to share. But since the owners didn't force the author to share, maybe it's their decision. \n\nSo the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the owners didn't make sharing mandatory, and the tip was given under the previous policy. But there's also an argument for A (in the wrong) if the new policy implies that all tips should be pooled retroactively. However, the owners didn't explicitly say that. They said it's up to the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong if they choose to keep it, as per the owners' discretion.\n"
