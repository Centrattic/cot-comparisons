Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but sometimes customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2K tip from an NBA player, and after the owners decided to enforce the policy strictly, the author was given a choice to keep it or share it with others. They're considering keeping it, but others are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is non-tipping, and the owners said tips should go into a common fund. The author kept the tip despite the new rules. Even though the owners didn't enforce it before, they now have a strict policy. The author's decision to keep the tip might be seen as going against the restaurant's rules, especially since they were given a clear directive after the meeting.\n\nAlso, the other waiters are upset, and the author is choosing to not share, which could be seen as selfish. But the author argues they're not rich and need the money. However, the original policy was that tips should be shared, so even if the owner said it's up to them, maybe there's an expectation of fairness. The fact that the owner is allowing the author to keep it now but not in the future might complicate things. The author might feel they have a right to it since they were allowed to keep it this one time, but the others might feel it's unfair because they follow the rules and don't get such tips.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner's statement that it's up to the author whether to keep it or not suggests some discretion. If the owner is giving them the choice, maybe the author isn't technically in the wrong. However, the owner's policy is to enforce sharing in the future, so keeping the past tip might still be seen as taking advantage of the old system. The question is whether the author is being fair or selfish. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the restaurant's policy is now clear that tips must be shared, then keeping it could be seen as not respecting the new policy. But if the owner allowed it this time, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the other staff might feel they were treated unfairly. It's a tricky situation. \n\nI think the key points are the restaurant's policy, the owner's instructions, and the fairness to other employees. Since the owner is now enforcing sharing, and the author was given the option to keep it, but others might argue that the author should have shared from the start, especially since the policy was not clear before. However, the owner's leniency in this case might mean the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the author might still have a moral obligation to share, even if the owner allows it. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the policy now is clear, and keeping the tip despite knowing the new rules could be seen as taking advantage. The other staff might feel they were not treated equally, especially if the author benefits from the ambiguity. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
