Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2000 tip with the other waiters in a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is non-tipping, and the owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author received a large tip from a customer, which they kept until the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly. Now, they're being asked to share the tip or keep it, but keeping it would mean not sharing with others.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they're not wealthy and need the money, especially with the holidays coming. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the policy was enforced. The owners said the author can keep it, but the question is whether they should share it.\n\nI need to consider the restaurant's policy. Since the restaurant is non-tipping, even if the owners were lenient before, the new policy is to collect tips into a common fund. The author got the tip before this policy was strictly enforced. The owners allowed them to keep it, which implies some leeway. However, the other waiters are upset because now they have to share any future tips, but the author received a large one-time tip.\n\nIs it fair for the author to keep it? Well, the policy was not clear before, and the owners let it slide. The author didn't know they had to share it when they received it. Also, the waitress who reported it started the whole issue. The author is being asked to share now, but the policy change came after the fact. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe the author should share, but the owners gave them a choice. If the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the policy is now to share any future tips, but the past is grandfathered, then the author isn't obligated. \n\nThe user is conflicted between personal need and fairness. The key points are the policy's ambiguity, the owners' leniency, and the sudden enforcement. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted under the previous understanding. But if the new policy applies retroactively, then maybe they should share. However, the owners didn't enforce it retroactively; they just said it's up to the author. So the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it.\n"
