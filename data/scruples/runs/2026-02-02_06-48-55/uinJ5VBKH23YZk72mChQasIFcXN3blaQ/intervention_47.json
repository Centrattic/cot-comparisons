Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant where tipping isn't supposed to happen, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2k tip from a big customer, and now the owners are cracking down. The other waiters are upset because the author kept the tip instead of sharing it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy about tips, which means they probably didn't enforce sharing tips but now they changed their policy to be stricter. So maybe when the author kept the tip, the new policy was just announced. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share it, but in the future, tips must be shared. \n\nNow, the author is choosing to keep the money. The others are upset because they feel it's unfair. But the owners didn't force the author to share it, so maybe they have the right to keep it. However, the author's decision to keep the tip might be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency, especially since the new system involves a shared fund. \n\nThe author is not in a great financial situation, so keeping the tip helps them during the holidays. On the other hand, the other waiters might feel that if tips are supposed to be shared now, past tips should also be shared. But the owners allowed the author to keep it, so maybe there's no obligation. \n\nI think the key point is the restaurant's policy. If the owners allowed the author to keep it, then technically they're not in the wrong. However, the social aspect of the workplace might mean that the author is seen as a bad person for not sharing. But legally or by policy, they're not in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
