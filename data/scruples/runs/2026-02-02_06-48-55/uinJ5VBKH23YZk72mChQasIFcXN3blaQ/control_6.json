Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, and the staff has a higher base salary. Tips are supposed to be left, but the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author got a big tip from an NBA player, which is reported, leading to a meeting where the owners decide to enforce the no-tipping policy strictly. The owner allows the author to keep the tip they already received but says future tips must be split. The author is considering keeping the $2000 instead of sharing.\n\nNow, the key points here: The restaurant's policy is no tips, but previously, owners turned a blind eye. When the author got the tip, it was under this existing, albeit unofficial, policy. Now that the policy is being enforced, the author has the chance to keep the tip they already received. The other waiters are upset, and the reporter is pushing for sharing.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the owners made it clear that future tips must be split, but they gave the author the choice on this particular tip. Since it's up to them, maybe they aren't obligated to share. But there's an argument about fairness. The other waiters might feel they should share in the tip since it's part of their common fund. However, the author is in a financial hardship and the tip was given under the previous lenient policy.\n\nAlso, the fact that the owners are now changing the policy might mean that the author didn't expect to have to share past tips. The owner's statement that it's up to the author to keep it suggests that there's no obligation. But there's also a social aspect\u2014keeping the tip might be seen as selfish, especially if others are now under stricter rules.\n\nBut legally, if the owner allows them to keep it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, though, maybe they should consider sharing. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which could be a mix of legal and moral. Since the owners gave them the choice, perhaps the author isn't technically in the wrong, but socially, it's a gray area. The answer might be B, No, because the owner gave them the option.\n"
