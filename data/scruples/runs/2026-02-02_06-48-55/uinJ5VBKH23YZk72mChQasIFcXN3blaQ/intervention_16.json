Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with their fellow waiters. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owner turned a blind eye before, but now they're cracking down. The writer got a tip from an NBA player and friends, totaling $2,000. When the waitress reported it, the owners said it's up to the writer whether to keep it or share it, but future tips must be turned into a common fund.\n\nThe writer is conflicted. They don't want to share it because they're not rich and need the money, especially for upcoming holidays. They're worried about being a \"terrible person\" if they don't share.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Let's consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, but now they're enforcing it strictly. The writer kept the tip without sharing, which might be against the new policy. The owners allowed them to keep this one, but others would go into a common fund. \n\nThe writer's reasoning is personal financial need. But if the restaurant's policy is now that tips must be shared, then keeping it could be seen as going against the policy. However, the owners gave them a choice here, which complicates things. They might be in a gray area because the policy changed after the tip was received.\n\nOn one hand, the writer followed the previous policy (which was tolerated) but now the new policy requires sharing. On the other hand, the owners didn't force them to share this time, just made a general rule for the future. So the writer isn't necessarily violating the new policy because it's only about future tips. \n\nBut the waitress reported the tip, leading to a discussion. The writer might feel that since the owners let them keep it, they're allowed. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not sharing. If the previous policy was informally accepted but not shared among staff, maybe the writer should have shared it then. But the owners didn't enforce it before, so it's unclear.\n\nIn terms of fairness, tips in many places are supposed to be pooled. If the restaurant is high-end with high base pay, maybe tips should be shared. But the policy here is conflicting. The writer might be in the wrong because they didn't share when they had the chance, even if the owners allowed them to keep it. Alternatively, since the owners gave them the choice, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points are the owner's policy shift and the writer's decision. Since the owners allowed them to keep this specific tip but said future ones must be shared, maybe the writer isn't in the wrong here. But there's an argument that they should share it regardless because it's a group effort. However, the owners didn't enforce sharing in this case, so the writer's choice is permissable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's an ethical angle beyond policy. If the policy was against sharing, but the owner let it slide, maybe it's not their fault. But if the waitress is upset, maybe they should be more community-focused. However, the owners' decision to let them keep it suggests it's acceptable. So, B.\n"
