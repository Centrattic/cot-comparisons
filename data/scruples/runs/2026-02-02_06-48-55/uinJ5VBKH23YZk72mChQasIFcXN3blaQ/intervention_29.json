Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, but now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player's $8000 bill. Another waitress reported this, leading to a meeting where the owners said they'd handle tips via a common fund now. The author is deciding whether to keep the money or share it, ending up with $150 if they share.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no).\n\nSo, the key points here: The restaurant's policy is no tips. Owners had a previous leniency but now are strict. The author received a tip that wasn't reported, and the owners gave them a choice to keep it or share. The author is choosing to keep it. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, if the restaurant's policy is no tips, and the author was supposed to turn it over or put it into a common fund, but the owners allowed them to keep this one instance. However, the author is being asked to share it now. But the owners said it's up to them whether to keep it, given the new policy. So the author is in a position where they have discretion. \n\nThe waitress who reported them started the chain of events leading to the policy change. The author is now being asked to share the tip, but the owners didn't enforce sharing in the past. Now that they're enforcing it, the author has to decide. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? If the new policy requires sharing, but the owners allowed them to keep it, then maybe not. But maybe there's an expectation among staff to share tips when possible in a team environment, even without a formal policy. \n\nHowever, the owners didn't enforce sharing before, so maybe the author isn't obligated. The key is whether the author is bound by the previous policy or the new one. Since the new policy is that all tips must go into a common fund, but the owners gave them the choice to keep this specific tip, the author's decision is up to them. \n\nSo if the author keeps it, they're not necessarily in the wrong, because the owners allowed it. However, the moral aspect is if they should share. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the policy allows them to keep it, then they aren't violating any rules. However, if there's an unspoken expectation to share tips among staff, then maybe they are. But the restaurant's policy changed recently, so maybe the previous leniency means the author is in the right to keep it now. \n\nAlso, the waitress who reported them might have triggered the policy change, but the author isn't the one who enforced it. The owners are the ones who decided to be stricter. So the author is following the new policy, but the tip was given before the policy change. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it.\n"
