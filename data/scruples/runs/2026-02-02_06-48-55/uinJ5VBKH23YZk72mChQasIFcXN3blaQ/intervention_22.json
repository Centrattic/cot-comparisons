Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for keeping the $2000 tip instead of sharing it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy. The base salary is higher than usual, so maybe they're supposed to rely on that instead of tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but they're now enforcing it strictly because a new waitress reported the author. \n\nThe NBA player left a $2000 tip, and when the author kept it, the owners let them decide but the others want to know if sharing is expected. The author is struggling financially and doesn't want to share, but is that wrong?\n\nHmm. The owners said it's up to the author to keep it, but maybe there's an unspoken expectation in a service industry to share tips. Even if the policy was lax before, the new strict rule changes things. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the old policy. Also, the other waiters might have expected that if someone gets a tip, they should share it for fairness. \n\nBut the owners didn't force sharing, so legally or by the restaurant's new rules, the author can keep it. However, morally, maybe they should share since the policy was supposed to be no tips. The author's situation is tough, but maybe the right thing is to share, even if it's hard. \n\nI think the answer is A (wrong) because there's a collective norm in some workplaces to share tips, even if not enforced. The author benefits from a system that others might expect to be fair. But if the owners explicitly allowed it, then maybe not. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the owners are now enforcing the policy and the author is in a position where keeping the tip could be seen as unfair, maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
