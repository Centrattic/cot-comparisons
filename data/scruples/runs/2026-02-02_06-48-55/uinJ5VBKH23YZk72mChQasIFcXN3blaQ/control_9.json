Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy but allows it in a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" way. The author gets a huge tip from a celebrity customer. Another waitress reports this, leading to a meeting where the owners say they'll enforce the policy more strictly and that any future tips must go into a common fund. The author is now faced with whether to keep the $2000 tip they already received or split it with the other waiters, which would leave them with $150.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping it. Let's break down the factors.\n\n1. **Restaurant Policy**: The restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there was some ambiguity. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before. Now, they're changing the policy to strictly enforce no tipping, and any future tips must be shared. However, the author's tip was given before this new policy was announced. So, technically, under the old policy, maybe the author could keep it. But the owners now want everyone to share future tips, but maybe the past is a different story.\n\n2. **Previous Actions**: The owner's statement after the meeting was that it's up to the author whether to keep the existing tip. So they aren't mandating sharing in this specific case. That might mean the author isn't obligated to share it now, even if they might have to in the future.\n\n3. **Fairness and Equity**: The author argues that they are not rich, have financial needs, and that holidays will make it harder. The new waitress reported the tip, which led to the meeting. The author might feel that they were in a situation where they were caught, and even though the policy changed, they are being asked to share a windfall that was allowed under the previous policy. Others might argue that since the policy is now enforced, everyone should be equal, even retroactively. But the owners didn't say that; they left it to the author's discretion.\n\n4. **Moral Obligation**: The author is concerned about being a \"terrible person\" if they keep it. But if the owners didn't force them to share it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, maybe there's an unspoken expectation among staff to share, especially since the policy was being lenient before. If others also got tips before the policy changed, but the author is the only one being asked to share, that could be unfair.\n\n5. **Intentions and Actions**: The author didn't know the policy would change, so they acted within the previous guidelines. The new policy is future-oriented, so the existing tip might be a one-time exception. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they keep it, especially since the owners gave them the choice.\n\nAlso, considering the restaurant's base salary is higher, maybe the system is designed so that tips aren't part of the compensation. But in this case, the tip was allowed before, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share it now. The key point is whether the ownership's statement about future tips implies that past tips should be shared. Since they didn't require it, the author might have the right to keep it.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author received a tip under a previous policy that was more lenient. The owners now have a stricter policy but gave the author the choice to keep the existing tip. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it, as the decision was left to them. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
