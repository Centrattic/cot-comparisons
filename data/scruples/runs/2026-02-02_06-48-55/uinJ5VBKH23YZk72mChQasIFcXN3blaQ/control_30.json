Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip with their coworkers.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The staff was previously allowed to keep tips if given, but now the owners are enforcing a strict policy where tips must be pooled. The author received a $2,000 tip from an NBA player's group. After being confronted by management and a coworker who reported them, they're being asked to share the tip, but the author is considering keeping it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few angles. The restaurant's policy was unclear initially\u2014owners turned a blind eye before. Now they're changing the policy. The author didn't know they had to share it before, but now the new rule is in place. However, management told them they can keep it, but future tips must be pooled. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author is bound by the old policy or the new one. Since the owners gave them the choice to keep the existing tip, maybe they weren't required to share it. But the question is about whether keeping it makes them the asshole. \n\nOn one hand, the author was following the previous implicit policy. On the other, they benefited from a loophole that's now closed. The coworker who reported them might feel unfair if they keep the tip while others have to share future ones. However, the management is allowing the author to keep this one instance. \n\nBut the author is keeping the tip despite the new policy, which might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. But since the management said it's up to them, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Also, the tip is from a one-time situation under the old policy. The author is in a tough spot financially, which adds context. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the new policy requires sharing future tips, but the past one didn't, the author might not be obligated to share the past tip. However, the coworker who reported them is now upset, which complicates things. But the owners allowed the author to keep it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they followed the policy as it existed at the time, and management gave them the option to keep it. The real issue might be the restaurant's policy change and how it's being applied retroactively, but the author isn't to blame for that. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
