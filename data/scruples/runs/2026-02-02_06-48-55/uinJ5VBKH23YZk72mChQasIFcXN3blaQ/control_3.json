Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received in a restaurant that has a non-tipping policy but previously turned a blind eye to tips. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners didn't enforce it strictly before. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, which is a significant amount. Then, after someone reported it, the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly, making all tips go into a common fund. Now the author is considering keeping the money they already received, even though future tips will be shared.\n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to share past tips now. Since the policy changed after the tip was received, the author might argue that it's their money because the rule didn't apply at the time. However, the restaurant is trying to enforce a new policy, and the author is being asked to comply retroactively. \n\nThe key points here are the timing of the policy change and the enforcement. The original tip was given before the new rules were in place. The owners didn't mention sharing past tips, only future ones. The author might be within their rights to keep it, especially since the policy was lax before. But there's a social expectation in some workplaces to share tips, even if the policy doesn't explicitly require it. \n\nHowever, since the policy was non-existent or non-enforced before, the author could argue they were following the previous unspoken agreement. The other waiters might feel it's unfair if the author keeps the money now that the policy has changed. But the owners didn't ask the author to return it, just to comply moving forward. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping the tip they got under the old rules. The new policy affects future tips, not past ones. The owners didn't retroactively claim the money. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
