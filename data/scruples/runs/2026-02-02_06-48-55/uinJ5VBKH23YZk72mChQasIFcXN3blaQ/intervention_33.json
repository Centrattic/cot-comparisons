Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye in the past. The author got a $2K tip from a wealthy customer, but when the policy changed, the owner allowed them to keep it. The other waitress reported the tip, and the owner said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share it, but future tips will be pooled. The author is considering keeping the $2K.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the restaurant's policy and the actions taken by the author. Initially, the policy was non-tipping, but there was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. Now, the policy is stricter, and the owner gave the author the choice to keep the existing tip. The author is choosing to keep it, which the owner has allowed. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the money. The owner said it's up to them, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The other waitress reported it, but the owner didn't enforce sharing in this case. The author is in a tough spot financially, so keeping the tip might be justified. However, maybe there's an unspoken expectation to share tips in some service industries, but the restaurant's new policy allows keeping it. \n\nI think the owner's decision to let the author keep it means they aren't obligated to share. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden rule or expectation beyond what the owner stated. Since the policy now says future tips go to a common fund, but the owner allowed the author to keep this specific tip, the author isn't violating any current rules. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
