Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person works at a high-end restaurant where tipping isn't allowed. The base salary is higher than usual, and there's a don't-ask-don't-tell policy about tips. But recently, a customer left a $2000 tip, which the writer kept. Now the owners are enforcing the no-tipping policy more strictly, and there's a debate about whether to share the tip or not. The writer is considering keeping it but feels conflicted because they don't want to be a bad person. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, meaning they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule actively. However, after the incident, they're changing the policy to require all tips to be turned in. The key point here is whether the previous policy allowed waiters to keep tips if they were given. If the owners were turning a blind eye, maybe the staff assumed they could keep tips. But now, with the new policy, it's clear that tips must be shared.\n\nThe writer got a tip when the policy was still loose. Now that the policy is stricter, the owners are saying that future tips must be shared, but what about past tips? The owners told the writer they can keep the existing $2000. So the writer is deciding whether to share it now or keep it. The issue is whether there's an obligation to share past tips that were allowed under the old policy.\n\nThe other waiters are upset, and the reporter is pushing for sharing. But if the old policy didn't require sharing, maybe the writer isn't obligated. However, maybe the new policy applies retroactively. The owners might consider all tips, past and present, to be part of the new rule. But the owners explicitly said it's up to the writer whether to keep the existing tip, implying they can keep it. In that case, the writer isn't in the wrong for keeping it. However, if the new policy now requires sharing all tips, including past ones, the writer might be expected to share. But the owners didn't enforce sharing in the past, so the writer might not be obligated now.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is in a financial hardship, living in a studio apartment and needing money for holidays. The amount they'd get if shared is $150, which is a small fraction of $2000. But keeping the tip might be seen as unfair to others who don't get tips. However, the policy was lenient before, so maybe the writer isn't at fault for taking advantage of that. But now that the policy is changing, maybe the writer should share to set a good example, even if it's not required.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the previous policy allowed keeping tips, the writer isn't in the wrong. However, if the new policy now requires sharing, but the owners allowed the writer to keep it, then the writer isn't in the wrong. Since the owners said it's up to the writer to keep it, they're not forcing sharing. So the writer isn't in the wrong for keeping it. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
