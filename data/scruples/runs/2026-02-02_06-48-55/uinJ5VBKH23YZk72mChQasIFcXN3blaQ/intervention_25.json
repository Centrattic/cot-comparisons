Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a waiter who received a $2,000 tip in a non-tipping restaurant and is considering keeping it instead of sharing with colleagues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye, allowing occasional tips. However, after the NBA player left a tip, the owner's stance changed, and they now want all tips to go into a common fund. The waitress reported the incident, leading to a meeting. The owner told the waiter he could keep the tip, but future tips must be shared.\n\nThe author is now debating whether to keep the $2,000 or split it. The question is if keeping it makes the author in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation. So, what's the reasoning here? Well, the owners have clarified the policy now\u2014tips must be pooled. But in this specific case, the owner allowed the tip to be kept. However, the author is being asked whether they should share it despite the owner's leniency.\n\nEthically, if the policy is now to pool tips, even retroactively, the author might be expected to comply. However, the owner gave them the choice. If the owner said it's up to them, then technically, they aren't violating any rules. But morally, the author is choosing not to share when others might expect it, especially since the waitress reported the tip and the policy is now stricter. The author's reasoning is about personal financial need, but others might argue fairness among staff is more important.\n\nBut the owner didn't enforce sharing in this case. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a question. However, since the owner allowed them to keep it, the author isn't violating company policy. The user's own stance is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a nuance here. The answer could be A or B depending on the angle. If the focus is on company policy as set by the owner, then B. If focusing on fairness among staff despite policy leniency, then A. But the owner's decision to let them keep it might mean the author isn't wrong. Hmm.\n"
