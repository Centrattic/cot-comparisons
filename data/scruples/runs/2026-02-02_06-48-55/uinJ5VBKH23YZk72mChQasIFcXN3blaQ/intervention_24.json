Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for keeping a $2,000 tip that they received when their restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but now they're enforcing the policy strictly. The author got a tip from a celebrity customer, and after being called out, the owners said it's up to the author to keep it or share it with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though the owners previously turned a blind eye, they've now changed their stance. The new rule is that all tips must go into a common fund. The author's decision to keep the tip might conflict with the new policy's intent to distribute tips equally. \n\nBut the owners explicitly told the author it's up to them whether to keep it or not. That complicates things. If the owners gave them the option, maybe the author isn't technically violating a rule by keeping it. However, the new policy is to enforce the common fund, which suggests that future tips should be pooled. The existing tip was before the new policy, so maybe the author is within their rights to keep it since the owners allowed them to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant expects all tips to be shared now, the author might be seen as exploiting a loophole. The other waiters might feel it's unfair that the author keeps the tip when others would have to share. The author's argument is about personal financial need, especially with holidays coming. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about fairness.\n\nThe key points are: the owners allowed the author to decide, the policy changed after the fact, and the author is choosing based on personal circumstances. If the owners gave the author the choice, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping it. However, morally, sharing could be seen as the right thing to do given the new policy and collective agreement. But legally or by the restaurant's rules, since they allowed the choice, the author isn't violating any rule. So the answer might hinge on whether it's a moral wrong or a policy violation. Since the owners gave them the option, the author isn't in the wrong per the rules, even if some might argue it's unfair to others.\n"
