Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing the tip with other waiters. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but now they're becoming stricter. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, but other waiters found out and the management is now enforcing a rule where tips have to be pooled. The author is considering keeping the tip but is worried about being seen as a terrible person.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are: the policy was unclear before, but now it's being enforced strictly. The management said they're going to collect tips into a common fund, but about the existing tip from the author, they said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share. The author is thinking of keeping it, but others are upset.\n\nIs the author wrong for keeping it? Well, the management is now enforcing the policy, so maybe the author should comply. But since the tip was already given before the new policy, the author has a choice. However, in many restaurant settings, tips are supposed to be split among staff, especially when there's a pooling policy. Even if the policy was not enforced before, the new policy is in place now, so keeping the tip might be seen as not following the new rules. Also, the other waiters reported the situation, so there's a sense of fairness expected here. If the author keeps the money, they might be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency and not sharing with others who also work there. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the author didn't know the new policy was coming, and the management allowed them to keep it. However, the author's decision might set a bad precedent. If everyone keeps their tips, the policy can't be enforced. So maybe the author should share the tip to maintain fairness and follow the new rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a financial bind and might need the money. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about personal financial needs. In a professional setting, especially in hospitality, sharing tips is often part of the unspoken agreement among staff. So the author might be in the wrong for not sharing, even though they're not legally required to. The management's policy now is clear, and the author's choice to keep it could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. They should have shared the tip to be fair to their coworkers and adhere to the new policy. Even though the management gave them a choice, the ethical thing would be to split it.\n"
