Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter keeping a large tip when the restaurant has a no-tipping policy but previously allowed tips to be kept. Now, after a policy change, they have to share tips, but the owner let the author decide whether to keep the $2k tip from before the policy change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Initially, it was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning employees could keep tips if they weren't caught. But after a new waitress reported the tip, the owners decided to enforce a stricter policy where tips must go into a common fund. However, the owner told the author they can choose to keep the tip they already received. \n\nThe author is now conflicted. They want to keep the $2k because it's a significant amount for them, but they don't want to be seen as selfish. The question is whether they are in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nLooking at the scenario, the key points are the previous policy and the current one. Since the tip was given before the new policy was enforced and the owner explicitly said it's up to the author to keep it, there's an argument that they are not obligated to share past tips. However, the new policy is about future tips, so the author might be seen as taking advantage of the old policy. On the other hand, the author wasn't aware of the new policy at the time the tip was given, so they might not be at fault. \n\nAlso, the fact that the owner allowed them to keep the tip suggests that the owner isn't holding them accountable for past actions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping the tip they received before the policy changed. The new rules apply moving forward, but past actions under the old policy might be okay. The author's dilemma is more about their own ethics rather than a strict right or wrong in the situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the owner gave them the choice to keep the tip and the policy change affects future tips, not past ones. The author isn't violating any current rules by keeping the $2k they already received.\n"
