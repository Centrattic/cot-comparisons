Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter who got a large tip at a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy but turned a blind eye in the past. Now, after a new waitress reported the tip, the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The author kept the $2000 tip and is wondering if they're in the wrong for not sharing it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners previously allowed it as a \"don't ask, don't tell\" thing. However, after a new waitress reported a tip, the owners decided to enforce the policy strictly. Now, the author was given a choice: keep the tip or share it. The author chose to keep it, but others might think they should split it.\n\nSo, the main question is about the ethics of keeping the tip versus sharing it. The restaurant's policy is against tipping, but the previous practice allowed it. The owners now want to enforce the policy, but they gave the author a choice. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for personal reasons and not wanting to be seen as a bad person.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the restaurant. If the policy was enforced after the tip was given, does that mean the author was in violation, or was the previous leniency enough to make it okay? The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, but they didn't explicitly say it was against the rules before. However, they are now changing the policy, which might mean that the author's action is now against the current policy. But since the owners allowed it in the past and only now are changing the rules, there's some ambiguity.\n\nAlso, the author is in a difficult financial situation. They live in a studio apartment and need the money for the holidays. The waitress who reported them might have a different perspective, but the owners gave the author a choice. The author isn't being forced to share it, so keeping it might be a personal decision based on their circumstances.\n\nEthically, if the restaurant's policy was not enforced before and now they're changing it, the author might not be in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the previous understanding. However, others might argue that since the policy is now strict, they should comply and share the tip now. But the owners said it's up to the author, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is fairness. If other waiters are now supposed to share tips, but the author is allowed to keep their previous tip, does that create inconsistency? But the owners made it a one-time decision for the author, not a general rule. Maybe the author is not obligated to share it because the policy changed after the fact.\n\nIn terms of being a \"terrible person,\" the author is not stealing from the restaurant but using a tip that was given under a previous policy. The waitress who reported them might be trying to enforce a new rule, but the owners gave discretion. The author's decision to keep it isn't against the new policy since it was already given before the policy change.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they followed the previous lenient policy and the owners allowed them to keep it. The new policy doesn't apply retroactively to their specific case. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
