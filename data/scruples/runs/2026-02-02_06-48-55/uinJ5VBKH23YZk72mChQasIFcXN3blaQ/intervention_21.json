Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter who got a $2000 tip from a customer at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, but now they're enforcing a strict no-tipping rule, and the author is considering keeping the tip instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policies. The owners initially turned a blind eye but are now strict. They told the author they can keep the tip but not accept future ones. The key here is whether there was an explicit agreement or policy about splitting tips even before the new rules. If the previous \"don't ask, don't tell\" implies that tips were supposed to be shared among staff, then keeping it might be wrong. But if there was no such agreement, maybe it's up to the individual.\n\nAnother angle: the other waiters found out and the author is being asked to share. The author argues they need the money for holidays. But in the restaurant industry, especially in places where tips are pooled, it's common to share. Even if the policy wasn't clear, the fact that the owners are now enforcing a common fund suggests that tips should be shared. The author's refusal to share could be seen as selfish, especially since the money came from a customer who might not have known the policy. However, the owners allowed the author to keep it, which complicates things. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If the restaurant's new policy requires sharing, but the owners gave a pass, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the previous policy implied sharing, then not sharing is wrong. Since the owners said they can keep it, maybe they're taking responsibility for the past, so the author isn't in the wrong. But the community might expect sharing. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a case for both sides. However, in typical AITA scenarios, not sharing when others are affected might be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
