Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners are turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer who was insistent, maybe because they're from a different country where tipping isn't standard, or just being generous. The owners then changed the policy to be stricter, and now the author is being asked to share the tip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the $2000 instead of splitting it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and what the owners have decided. Initially, the policy was don't ask, don't tell, but after someone reported a tip, the owners made it clear that future tips must go into a common fund. But for the past instance, they said it's up to the author whether to keep it. So the author is trying to decide between keeping the money or sharing it now that the policy is changing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. The restaurant's policy wasn't clear initially. The owners allowed a certain amount of flexibility before, so maybe the author isn't legally or ethically obligated to share it. However, once the policy was made stricter, maybe the author should comply moving forward. But the question is about the past tip, not future ones.\n\nAnother angle: if the policy was strict from the start, but the owners allowed some leeway, but now they're enforcing it, the author might be in a gray area. The fact that the owners left it up to the author suggests that there's no strict rule about past tips. The author could argue that since the policy wasn't enforced before, they had a reasonable expectation that keeping the tip was acceptable.\n\nHowever, the other waiters are upset, and there's a sense of fairness if everyone is supposed to share tips. But in many service jobs, especially in places where tips are part of wages, the law requires that tips be shared among staff. But the restaurant here is non-tipping, so maybe the tipping laws don't apply in the same way. The owner's new policy says tips must be turned into a common fund, but for the past instance, they said it's up to the author. So maybe the author isn't legally bound to share it, but there's a social expectation to do so.\n\nAlso, the author mentions financial hardship, which adds empathy. They need money for the holidays and aren't well-off. The amount they'd get if shared is only $150, which is a small fraction of the $2000. So from a financial standpoint, keeping the money helps them more, but from a fairness standpoint, if others are expected to share, the author might feel they should too.\n\nBut the owners didn't explicitly say that past tips must be shared. They only mandated future tips. So maybe the author isn't technically in the wrong, but morally, if the new policy is about fairness, they might feel conflicted. It's a tough call between personal need and collective fairness.\n\nIn many cases, if a restaurant has a no-tipping policy but allows tips, the staff usually splits them. However, since the owners here allowed the leeway and now the author is being asked to share, but the owners didn't enforce it before, the author might have a point in keeping it. But if the policy was meant to be a common fund from the start, even if not enforced, then maybe the author should share. The owners' response that it's up to the author suggests that there's no strict rule, so the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
