Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2000 tip with their fellow waiters. The restaurant is a high-end place with a no-tipping policy, but some customers sometimes leave tips anyway. The owners have been turning a blind eye, but after the author got a big tip from an NBA player, the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly. Now, the author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it with others, but they're considering keeping it all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Initially, the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, which suggests they weren't enforcing the no-tipping rule actively. However, after the incident, they changed their policy and now require that any tips be turned into a common fund. The author received the tip before the new policy was in effect, so the owners gave them the option to keep it or share it. But the author is choosing to keep the entire amount, which the other waiters are upset about.\n\nLegally, in some places, tips are considered the property of the employee unless there's a specific policy that requires sharing. If the restaurant didn't have a formal policy before, the author might be within their rights to keep the tip. However, the owners now want to enforce a common fund, which might mean that any tips after the policy change go to the group. But this situation is about a tip received before the policy change. The owners allowed the author to keep it, but other staff are upset because they feel it's unfair.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. If the previous policy was informal and the owner allowed individual keep, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the new policy is about future tips, so the author's decision might be seen as taking advantage of the old, informal policy to keep the money when others are now being told that's not possible. The waitress who reported the tip might feel that the author should share because the new policy is meant to be fair, but the author received the tip before the policy was enforced. \n\nAnother angle is the social contract among the staff. Even if the owner allowed the author to keep it, the other staff might feel it's unfair that only the author benefits from the old policy, especially if they had to follow the stricter rules after. The author is in a tough spot financially, which adds to the complexity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the owner explicitly said it's up to the author to keep the tip, then legally they might not be. But ethically, if the staff collectively expects that tips should be shared, then the author might be seen as selfish. The answer depends on whether the policy was clear and how the owner's statement is interpreted. Since the owner allowed the author to keep it, but other staff are upset, there's a conflict between individual rights and group fairness. \n\nIn tip-sharing scenarios, especially in restaurants, it's common for all tips to go into a pool and distributed among staff. If the previous policy was unclear but the owner allowed individual keep, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the new policy changes that, and the author's decision might be seen as taking advantage of the loophole. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) if the owner's statement is considered part of the new policy, or B (not in the wrong) if the owner's allowance was a one-time exception. The key is whether the owner's statement was a formal exception or just a personal choice. Since the owner allowed it, but others are upset, the author's decision is morally questionable even if legally okay. So the answer is likely A.\n"
