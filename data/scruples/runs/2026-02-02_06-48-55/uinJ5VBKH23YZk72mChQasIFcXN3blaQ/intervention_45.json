Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye to customers leaving tips. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer who paid a $8000 bill, which is a significant amount. The owners then decided to enforce the policy more strictly and introduced a common fund system. The author is now being asked if they should share that $2000 with the other waiters, but they're reluctant because they need the money.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owners' initial leniency, and the new enforcement. The author's argument is that they didn't know there was a policy against it until the meeting, and now they're being asked to share, but they feel it's unfair since they're not rich and need the money.\n\nBut wait, the owners said after the meeting that it's up to the author to keep the tip, but future tips must go into a common fund. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the restaurant has a policy that tips are supposed to be shared (like in many restaurants), then the author might be wrong for keeping it. But in this case, the restaurant is non-tipping, so perhaps tips weren't expected to be shared. However, the owners are now enforcing a policy where future tips go into a common fund. The author received the tip before this policy was enforced. \n\nThe owners allowed the tip to be kept, but the author is being asked to share it now. The problem is that the author didn't know the policy before, and the owners didn't enforce it until after the tip was received. The owner's response was that the author could keep it, but future tips must be shared. That seems to suggest that the author isn't obligated to share the existing tip. However, the waitress who reported them might have expected sharing if the policy was in place. \n\nBut the owners didn't enforce the policy until after the tip was given. So the author might have a point if they followed the previous leniency. However, the new policy affects future tips, not retroactive. So the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the old policy. \n\nOn the other hand, the waitress who reported them might argue that all tips should be shared, which is a common practice in some restaurants. But since the restaurant was non-tipping, maybe tips weren't supposed to be shared in the first place. The owners' initial policy was a don't ask, don't tell, so the author might not have known they were supposed to share. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether the author knew or should have known that tips needed to be shared. If the restaurant's policy was clear that even if tips were received, they should be pooled, then the author is in the wrong. But if the policy was only recently enforced and wasn't clear before, then the author isn't at fault. \n\nSince the owners allowed the tip to be kept initially and only changed the policy after the fact, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. The key is whether the author had prior knowledge that tips should be shared. If the policy wasn't clearly communicated before, then the author can't be blamed for keeping it. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they followed the previous leniency and the new policy doesn't apply retroactively. The owners allowed them to keep the tip after the fact, so sharing isn't required now.\n"
