Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter in a high-end restaurant where tipping is not allowed, but occasionally customers still leave tips. The owner's policy is a \"don't ask, don't tell\" one, meaning they ignore it unless someone reports it. The author got a $2K tip from an NBA player, which a coworker reported, leading to a new policy to collect tips in a common fund. Now the author is deciding whether to keep the tip or share it.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the restaurant is in a state where tips are legally allowed. In some places, like California, tips are supposed to go to the employee. If the restaurant is in California, then the policy of taking the tips might be against the law. But the user didn't specify the location, but mentioned it's in LA, which is in California. So maybe the author is legally allowed to keep the tip. \n\nThen, the original policy was that the owners were turning a blind eye. So even though there was a rule against tipping, it wasn't enforced before. Now, after the report, the policy is changing to collect tips. But the author already got a tip before this new policy was strictly enforced. The owners told them it's up to their discretion whether to keep it, but the coworker is pressuring them to share. \n\nThe author is struggling because they need the money, especially for the holidays. But the other wait staff are upset. The question is if the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the tip was left before the policy changed, and the owner's new policy applies only to the future, the author might not be in the wrong. They could argue that the tip was earned under the previous, unenforced policy. However, from a moral perspective, if the policy was supposed to be a shared fund and the author knew that, even if not enforced before, then keeping the tip could be seen as unfair to the others. \n\nAlso, the coworker reported the tip, which led to the policy change. The author might feel that the coworker is now trying to get the money after reporting them, which could be a point of contention. \n\nSo, the key factors are the legal rights in California, the original policy's enforceability, and the social contract among the staff. If the tip was left before the new policy was in effect, and the author was allowed to keep it, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the policy was always supposed to be in place, even if unenforced, then the author might be expected to share. \n\nI think the answer would depend on whether the restaurant's policy was legally binding or just an internal guideline. Since in California, tips are property of the employee unless the employer has a valid tip pooling arrangement, the author might be in the right legally. But socially, if the others are upset, there might be a conflict. However, the original policy was not enforced, so the author could argue they followed the previous understanding. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
