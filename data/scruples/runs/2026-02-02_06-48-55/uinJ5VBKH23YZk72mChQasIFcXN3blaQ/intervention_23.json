Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter who received a $2000 tip at a non-tipping restaurant and is considering keeping it instead of sharing it with fellow waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy, but the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. However, after a complaint from a new waitress, the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly. Now, any tips must be put into a common fund. The author received a large tip before this policy change and is now being asked to share it or keep it.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy, the change in policy after the complaint, and the author's decision to keep the tip. The owners told the author it's up to them whether to keep the tip, but the author is conflicted. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the previous policy allowed tips to be kept by the individual server, then the author might be within their rights. However, the new policy requires sharing tips, but this applies going forward, not retroactively. The author received the tip under the old policy. The issue is whether the author should share the tip from a past transaction under a previous, more lenient policy.\n\nLegally, if the restaurant didn't have a formal policy that tips should be pooled, then the author might not be obligated to share. However, in many places, especially in the US, tips are considered the property of the employee unless there's a formal tip pooling agreement. But this depends on local labor laws. Since the restaurant is in LA, California labor laws might apply. California allows tip pooling only if all employees participate and it's voluntary. If the restaurant now wants to enforce pooling, they might need to adjust their policies.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they are entitled to the tip since they served the customers directly. However, if the restaurant's new policy affects all future tips, but the author is being asked to comply retroactively, that could be unfair. The waitress who reported the tip might be acting in the interest of fairness, but the author might not be in the wrong for keeping a tip earned under previous conditions.\n\nAnother angle is the restaurant's policy change. If the owners allowed tips in the past without sharing, the author might not have reason to share now. However, the new policy aims to prevent individual servers from keeping tips, which could lead to inconsistencies. The author is in a tricky spot because the policy changed after they received the tip.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because the tip was given under the previous policy, and the new policy doesn't apply retroactively. However, the ethical stance depends on whether the restaurant had an informal agreement to share tips even before the new policy. If there was no such agreement, the author is within their rights to keep it. If there was an unspoken expectation of sharing, then they might be wrong. But given the information, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B).\n"
