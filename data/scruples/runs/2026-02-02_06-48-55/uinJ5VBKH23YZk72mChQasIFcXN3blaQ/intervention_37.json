Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing the tip. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe restaurant is non-tipping, but the owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author got a $2,000 tip from a customer, but now the owners are making the policy stricter. After the group meeting, the owners said it's up to the author to keep the tip or share it. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to the meeting. The author is considering keeping the money because they're not rich and need the extra for holidays, but they're also worried about being seen as a terrible person.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and the author's actions. The policy is non-tipping, but the owners previously allowed tips if they weren't reported. Now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author got a tip before the new policy was enforced. The question is whether they should share it now.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, since the owners are now stricter, the previous leniency is over. The author received the tip under the old policy, but now the new rule is that tips must be turned into a common fund. However, the owners gave the author a choice to keep it. So, is the author obligated to share it now?\n\nThe author argues they're in a tough financial situation and need the extra money. But others might say that since the policy exists and the previous leniency is gone, the author should comply with the new rules, which include sharing the tips. The fact that the owner allowed the author to keep it but others might not is a bit confusing. It seems like the owner is giving the author a choice, but maybe the author is taking advantage of that choice.\n\nAlso, the waitress who reported the tip is part of the new staff upset about the policy. The author might feel it's unfair to share with people who were complaining about the policy before the NBA incident. But then again, the new policy affects everyone moving forward.\n\nThe ethical angle is tricky. If the owner is allowing the author to keep the tip, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the previous leniency is now being replaced with a strict policy where all tips go into a common fund, then the author might be in the wrong by not sharing with others who were part of the same system. However, since the owner gave the author a choice, maybe the author isn't obligated to share it.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the owner gave them the choice to keep the tip. The owner's words were that it's up to them, so the author isn't forced to share. However, if the author had known the policy before receiving the tip, they might have acted differently. But since the policy changed after the fact, the author might be in a position where they can keep the money as a one-time exception.\n\nBut wait, the owner's statement about future tips needing to be turned into a common fund doesn't necessarily apply to past tips. So if the author got the tip before the new policy was in place, they might not have to share it. However, the author is now part of a system where the owner is enforcing a new policy, so maybe they should share it to set a precedent. But the owner didn't make it mandatory, just a choice.\n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were given the choice. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the previous leniency was a loophole they shouldn't take advantage of now that the policy is strict. However, since the owner gave them the option to keep it, they aren't technically violating the new policy. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
