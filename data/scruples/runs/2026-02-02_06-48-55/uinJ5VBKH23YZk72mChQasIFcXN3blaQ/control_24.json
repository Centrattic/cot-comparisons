Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but they allowed tips in the past. Now there's a new policy where tips have to be turned into a common fund. The person received a $2k tip from a famous NBA player, and the management is now enforcing the policy. They're being asked if they should share the tip with the other waiters, which would leave them with only $150. They're wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) for keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The restaurant previously had a don't ask, don't tell policy regarding tips, but now they're enforcing a strict no-tipping rule. The employees are expected to turn tips into a common fund if customers insist. However, the author received the tip before this new policy was announced. The owners told them they can decide whether to keep it or share it, but the other waiters are upset, and the author is conflicted.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the policy was already in place, but they were lenient. The author kept the tip before the new rules were strictly enforced. The key here is whether the author is expected to share past tips that were allowed under the old policy. The owners didn't make it mandatory for the author to share; they left it up to them. However, the other waiters are now complaining, which might create tension. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might feel they earned the tip, especially since it was under the previous policy. But there's an expectation now that tips go into a common fund. However, the owners didn't force them to share the past tip, so it's a personal choice. The author is not necessarily in the wrong because the owners gave them the option to keep it. The main issue is whether the author's decision to keep it is considered selfish, but legally or ethically, since the owners allowed it, they might not be wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the restaurant's policy shifts, it's possible that the owners are trying to enforce a new rule, but the author's situation is a gray area. The author might argue that they followed the previous policy and that the new rules don't apply retroactively. On the other hand, fairness among the staff could be a concern. But since the owners didn't mandate sharing the existing tip, the author's choice to keep it isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
