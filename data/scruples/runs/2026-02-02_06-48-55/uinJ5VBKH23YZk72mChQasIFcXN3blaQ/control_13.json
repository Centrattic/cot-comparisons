Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip with fellow waiters. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owner turned a blind eye. The author got a $2k tip from a customer, and now the owner wants to enforce the policy, making tips go into a common fund. The author is deciding whether to keep the tip or share it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though the owner was lenient before, they've now changed the policy. So the author is technically supposed to follow the new rules. The owner allowed the author to keep it, but the author is supposed to share it with others now. However, the author is in a personal financial situation where keeping the tip is more beneficial.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know the policy was going to change, so maybe they didn't have a chance to share it. Also, the owner gave them the option to keep it. If the owner allowed it, maybe it's okay. However, in a professional setting, sharing tips is common in many places, so maybe the author should share. But the amount is significant, and the author is in a tough spot financially. The other waiters might expect it since the policy now requires sharing, but the author was given the choice.\n\nHmm. The key points are: the policy changed, the owner allowed the author to keep it, but others might feel it should be split. But the author's financial situation is bad. It's a bit of a moral dilemma. Legally or by policy, maybe the author isn't wrong because the owner permitted keeping it. But ethically, maybe they should share if that's the new policy. But since the owner allowed the author to keep it, maybe it's okay. So the answer could be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
