Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for keeping a $2000 tip when the restaurant has a no-tipping policy but previously turned a blind eye. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there's a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. The author got a tip from a high-profile customer, and now after a meeting, the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The key point is that the owners gave the author a choice to keep the tip they already received, but future tips must be shared. \n\nSo the author is deciding whether to keep the $2k or split it. The other waitresses are upset because maybe they think tips should be shared, but the previous policy wasn't enforced. Now the owners are changing the policy, and the author is caught in the middle.\n\nThe user is asking if keeping the tip makes them the asshole. The author's reasoning is that they're not rich, the money would help, and they didn't expect to have to share it. The owners allowed them to keep it, but maybe there's an unspoken expectation now to share because of the new policy. \n\nBut the owners explicitly said it's up to them to keep it. So technically, they might not be in the wrong since the owners gave them the option. However, maybe there's an implied sense of fairness or camaraderie among the staff. If others are following the new rule and the author keeps the money, they might be seen as unfair. But since the owners allowed it, maybe it's okay. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't breaking the current rules because the owners let them keep it. But if the previous policy was to share, then maybe they should have shared. But the story says the owners had a don't-ask-don't-tell before, so maybe the author didn't know they had to share. Now the policy is changing. Since the owners gave them the choice, keeping it might be acceptable. \n\nSo the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong because the owners allowed them to keep it. But some might argue that in a team environment, sharing is expected. However, the owners didn't enforce sharing before, only now. So it's a bit tricky, but the answer leans towards B.\n"
