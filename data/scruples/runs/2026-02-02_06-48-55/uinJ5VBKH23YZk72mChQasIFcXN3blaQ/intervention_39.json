Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners have been turning a blind eye before but now want to enforce it strictly after the new waitresses complained. The NBA player left a $2k tip, and the author kept it. The owners gave them the option to keep it, but the author is considering whether to split it. \n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy and the group's reaction. The owners have now decided that tips must be shared in a common fund. However, the owner allowed the author to keep this particular tip, maybe to avoid conflict. The author is now faced with a choice: keep the money or share it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're not rich, need the money for holidays, and don't want to be a \"terrible person.\" But they're reluctant to share because the amount would be split among others, leaving them with only $150. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe there's no legal obligation. But morally, the group dynamic is important. The restaurant is trying to enforce a shared policy now, so keeping the tip might set a bad precedent. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since others are following the new rules. \n\nHowever, the author is in a difficult financial situation. They might not have the means to share, which complicates the moral judgment. The question is whether they have a moral obligation to share despite personal need. \n\nIn many service industries, tips can be pooled and split among staff. Even if the policy was previously ignored, the new policy requires sharing. The author received the tip under the previous leniency but now the rules have changed. The owner's decision to let them keep it might be an exception, but if others are sharing, it could create inequality. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between personal gain and fairness to the team. Not sharing could be seen as unfair, especially if others are adhering to the new policy. But since the owner permitted it, there's a gray area. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even though they were allowed to keep the tip, the new policy emphasizes sharing. By keeping it, they might be undermining the new rules and not being fair to their colleagues. The fact that the owner gave them a choice might mean the author has the responsibility to do the right thing, even if it's hard financially.\n"
