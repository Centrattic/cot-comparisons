Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for keeping a $2000 tip when their restaurant has a no-tipping policy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant owner has a no-tipping policy, but there was a sort of unspoken understanding where some customers might still leave tips. The author didn't know there was a strict policy until after a new waitress reported them. The owners then clarified that they want to enforce the policy strictly, and tips should be turned into a common fund. However, in this specific case, the author received a $2000 tip, and the owners allowed them to keep it, even though they said future tips must be shared. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for their own needs versus sharing it with colleagues.\n\nSo the key points here are: the policy was unclear until recently, the owner allowed the author to keep this particular tip, and the author is struggling with whether to do so. If the owner explicitly said it's up to the author to keep it, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the policy now requires sharing, even past tips, then the author might be wrong to keep it. However, the owner's statement was that future tips must go into the common fund, but for this instance, it's up to the author. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because the owner gave them discretion. \n\nAlso, the author is in a tough financial situation, which adds to the moral dilemma. The question is whether keeping the tip is selfish or justified given the owner's leniency on this one occasion. Since the policy changed after the tip was already received, the owner didn't expect the author to share it retroactively. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. But maybe there's an expectation of fairness among staff, even if the policy changed. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the owner allowed them to keep it, and the policy change applies moving forward. The author isn't required to share past tips that were kept under the old, more lenient policy. So the decision to keep it is their own, and the owner acknowledged that.\n"
