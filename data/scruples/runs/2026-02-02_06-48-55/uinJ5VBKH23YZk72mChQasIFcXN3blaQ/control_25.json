Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter keeping a large tip from an NBA player instead of sharing it with fellow waiters after the restaurant's policy changed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is non-tipping but has a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. Now, after a high-profile tip, the owners are enforcing a stricter policy where any tips must go into a common fund. The author received a $2k tip and is deciding whether to keep it or share it, but sharing would leave them with only $150. They're conflicted because they're not wealthy and need the money for holidays.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy, the collective agreement among staff, and the financial situation of the author. The owners allowed the author to keep the existing tip, but future tips must be pooled. The author is considering keeping the money despite the new policy's implications for others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the restaurant's policy is clear now that they must pool tips. However, in this specific case, the tip was given before the policy change was enforced. The owner's response was that it's up to the author whether to keep it. But other waiters might expect that since the policy is now strict, past tips should be shared. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency, which could be unfair to others who didn't get similar opportunities. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is facing financial difficulties and the money is a significant amount for them. The question is whether keeping the tip, even if it's a one-time thing, is wrong when the policy now requires sharing. The owners didn't explicitly make the author share it, but the author might feel pressured by the new policy's spirit. \n\nIn some work environments, tips are considered communal, especially in service industries where tips are part of the income. If the restaurant changed the policy to enforce sharing, then even past tips might be expected to be pooled for fairness. The author's decision to keep it could be seen as undermining the new policy and fairness among staff. \n\nBut if the owners allowed the author to keep it, maybe it's within their discretion. However, the other waiters might feel it's unfair that some can keep tips while others can't. The author might be creating a precedent by keeping it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the policy change affects past incidents. If the owners said it's up to the author, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the policy implies that all tips should be shared moving forward and the author is using that leniency to keep a large sum, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author is choosing to keep a significant amount that others might expect to be shared, even though the owners gave them the choice, there's an argument that it's unfair to the others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But if the owners explicitly allowed them to keep it, then perhaps not. The answer might be A (yes) because the author is keeping money that others might expect to be shared under the new policy, even if they had the choice. Alternatively, if the owner's decision to let them keep it was final, then B (no). \n\nThe key is that the author's decision could set a bad example and undermine the new policy's fairness. So, maybe the answer is A. But if the owner allowed it, then perhaps B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not sharing when the policy now requires it. Since the author had the choice, but the policy is about future tips, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the fact that other staff might have expected to share, even if the author didn't have to, could make them wrong. \n\nHmm, tricky. I think the consensus would lean towards A because in a work environment where tips are communal, keeping a large tip after a policy change enforcing sharing, even if given the choice, could be seen as not being a team player. So, answer A.\n"
