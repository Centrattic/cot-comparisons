Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. The situation is at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant where the policy is no tips, but the owners are turning a blind eye. The writer got a $2k tip from an NBA player and his friends. The owners now want to enforce the no-tipping policy, and there's a discussion about whether the writer should keep the tip or share it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is clear: no tips. The owners had a don't-ask-don't-tell approach before, but now they're being stricter. When the writer got the tip, the owners said it's up to them whether to keep it, but future tips would be shared. The writer is considering keeping the $2k, which could leave others with $150 each if split. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and the agreement among the staff. Even though the owners didn't explicitly enforce the policy in the past, they've now clarified that tips must be shared. The writer was given the choice to keep this particular tip, but the implication is that future tips are to be pooled. However, the writer is choosing to keep the tip despite the new policy and the fact that others might be expecting to share. \n\nThe writer's argument is that they are not rich and need the money for holidays. But the other waiters might feel it's unfair if the tip isn't shared, especially if the new policy is to have a common fund. The owners allowed the writer to keep the tip, but maybe the writer should consider sharing it to maintain good relations with colleagues and uphold the spirit of the new policy, even if it's not enforced retroactively. \n\nAlternatively, since the owners gave the writer the option to keep it, maybe the writer isn't technically in the wrong. But ethically, if the policy is to share, and the writer is in a position where keeping the tip could set a bad precedent or cause resentment, they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the agreement with the owners was explicit. If the owners allowed them to keep the tip in this case, then technically the writer isn't violating any rules. However, morally, if the new policy is to share future tips, keeping this one might be seen as inconsistent or unfair to others who might have expected the same leniency. But since the owners specifically allowed this one, maybe it's not the writer's fault. However, considering the social dynamics and fairness, the writer might be seen as in the wrong for not sharing, especially if others contributed to enforcing the new policy. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here.\n"
