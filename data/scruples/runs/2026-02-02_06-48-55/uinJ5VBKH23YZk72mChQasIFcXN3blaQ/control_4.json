Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a restaurant where tipping is officially not allowed, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer, kept it, and now there's a new policy where tips have to be shared. The other waiters are upset because of the new policy and the author not sharing the tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners said they don't allow tips, but before, they didn't enforce it strictly. Now they're enforcing it more. The author got the tip before the new policy was announced. The owners told the author they could keep it, but future tips would be pooled. \n\nSo the key points here are: the tip was given before the policy changed, the owners allowed the author to keep it, and the author is now being asked to share it with others. But the author didn't know the money would have to be shared at the time they received it. Also, the policy change is in response to the new waitresses complaining, which might indicate that the previous leniency wasn't uniform.\n\nThe author's argument is that they kept the tip because they weren't aware of the new sharing policy when they received it. The owners allowed them to keep it, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share it now. On the other hand, the new policy is supposed to prevent individual waiters from keeping tips, but since it's a new rule, it might not apply retroactively. \n\nHowever, there's a question of fairness. The other waiters might feel that since the policy is now in place, the past tip should be shared. But the author wasn't in the wrong when they took the tip because the policy wasn't enforced before. The owners' decision to let the author keep it suggests they don't want the author to be punished for past actions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the owners said it's okay to keep the tip, then the author isn't at fault. The new policy applies to future tips, not past ones. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the $2000.\n"
