Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe restaurant is a high-end place with a \"non-tipping\" policy. The staff has a higher base salary, but sometimes customers still leave tips. The owners used to not enforce this strictly, like a don't ask, don't tell policy. Then the author got a big tip from an NBA player and friends\u2014$2,000. Another waitress found out and reported it, leading to the owners enforcing a stricter policy now. The author is now being asked if they should share that tip with the other waiters, but they're thinking about keeping it because they're not doing well financially.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for keeping the tip? The user thinks yes, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy. The owners said not to accept tips, and now they're enforcing that. But the author had the tip before the enforcement. The owners told the author they can choose to keep it or turn it in. So legally, maybe the author isn't breaking any laws, but ethically?\n\nThe owners' policy is non-tipping, so if they're supposed to share tips, the author might be violating that policy. But the policy wasn't enforced before. The new waitress reported it, causing the policy change. The author got the tip before the policy was strictly enforced. The owners gave them the choice to keep it. So maybe the author is in a tricky spot. \n\nEthically, if the policy is meant to be fair and ensure everyone splits tips, keeping the money might be seen as selfish. But the author is in a tough financial situation. On the other hand, the waitress who reported it might have done so to enforce fairness, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nBut the owners have now said that future tips must be split, but the author's tip was before that. The owners let the author keep it, but the author is being pressured to share. If the author keeps it, they might be seen as not following the new policy, but they weren't aware of the new policy when they got the tip. However, the new policy applies to future tips, not past ones. So maybe the author isn't obligated to share the past tip. \n\nBut the community might think that once a new policy is in place, everyone should comply, even if it affects past actions. However, the owners didn't require the author to share the existing tip. They gave them the choice. So technically, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. But maybe morally, they should share it because the policy is about fairness.\n\nHmm. The key points are: the tip was before the new policy, the owners allowed the author to keep it, and the author is being asked to share it now. The author's financial situation is a factor, but the waitress's action was to enforce the new policy. The owners' decision to let the author keep it might mean they aren't in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the policy exists for a reason, and even though it's past, sharing it is fair. However, since the owners gave them the choice, the author isn't forced. So I think the answer is B.\n"
