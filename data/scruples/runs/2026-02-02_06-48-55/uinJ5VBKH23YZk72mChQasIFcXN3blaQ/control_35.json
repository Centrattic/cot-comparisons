Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter who received a $2000 tip in a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but now they're getting stricter. The waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the owner said the person can choose to keep it, but future tips must be shared. Now the author is conflicted about keeping the money or sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is non-tipping, and the owners have now clarified that tips must be shared in a common fund. The author received a tip before this policy was strictly enforced. The owners gave them the choice to keep it or share. So legally and according to the new policy, the author isn't forced to share. But there's a moral aspect here.\n\nThe key points are: the restaurant's policy, the employees' expectations, and the social dynamics. The author isn't stealing; they received the tip before the policy changed and were given the option to keep it. However, the other waiters might feel it's unfair since tips are supposed to be shared now. The author is in a difficult position, especially if they're struggling financially. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip when others might expect sharing.\n\nIn many restaurants, even if there's a no-tipping policy, if a customer slips a tip directly to a server, it's sometimes kept by the server. But in this case, the restaurant now requires sharing. However, the author was told they can keep it. The moral dilemma is whether to keep the money for personal use or share with others. Since the owners have given the choice, the author isn't violating any rules by keeping it. But if others argue that tips should have been shared from the start, then there's a case for sharing. However, the policy wasn't enforced before, so the author might not be at fault. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is following the owners' directive and the tip was received under the old, more lenient policy. The author isn't forced to share, so it's not wrong for them to keep it, even if it's seen as greedy by others.\n"
