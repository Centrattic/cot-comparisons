Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the restaurant is supposed to be a non-tipping place, but sometimes customers still leave tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they don't enforce it unless someone brings it up. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, but when the new waitress reported it, the owners had a meeting and said they'll be stricter now. The author is now being asked to either keep the tip or turn it over to a common fund, which would mean sharing with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though it's non-tipping, the owners have historically allowed it without enforcing it. The author's actions were within that existing policy before the meeting. But after the meeting, the policy is changing. The author has to decide now whether to comply by sharing the tip or keeping it. However, the owners said it's up to the author to decide for this instance since it's a past event. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. From a fairness standpoint, if the policy is now that tips must be shared, maybe the author should contribute to the common fund. But since the author didn't know about the policy change beforehand and the owners are giving them a choice for this one case, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the moral aspect: the waitress reported it, which might have caused the policy to change. If the author keeps the tip, is that being selfish? But the author is in a tight financial situation, and the tip is a significant amount. They might not have expected to have to share it, especially since the policy wasn't enforced before. \n\nI think it's about the restaurant's policy and the owner's instruction. Since the owners allowed it in the past and now are saying it's up to the author, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the new policy is meant to be fair among all staff, then keeping the tip might be seen as not following the new spirit of the policy. However, the key point is that the owners are giving the author a choice here. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it, especially since they're not a bad person and the situation was ambiguous before. But there's a potential for others to feel it's unfair. I'm a bit torn, but since the owners allowed it and the author was following the previous policy, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
