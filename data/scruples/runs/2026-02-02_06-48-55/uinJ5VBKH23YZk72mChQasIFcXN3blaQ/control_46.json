Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant doesn't allow tipping, but sometimes customers still leave tips. The owners had a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author got a $2000 tip from a big customer, and when others found out, the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it or share. The author is considering keeping it because they're not rich and need the money, especially with holidays coming up. They're worried about being a \"terrible person.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is non-tipping, which is unusual because typically tips go to the staff. But here, the base salary is higher. The owners previously turned a blind eye, but now they're strict. The author received the tip before the new policy was enforced, and the owners left it up to them. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there was prior tacit acceptance.\n2. The author got a tip before the new enforcement.\n3. Owners are now strict, but for past incidents, they're allowing individual discretion.\n4. The author is deciding whether to keep the tip or split it with others.\n\nIs there a formal policy that tips must be shared? The previous policy was \"don't ask, don't tell,\" which implies that while the policy exists, it wasn't enforced strictly before. Now, the new policy requires tips to be turned into a common fund if customers insist. However, for the author's case, the owners allowed them to decide. \n\nSo, legally and by policy, since the owners are allowing the author to keep it, there's no obligation to share. The author isn't violating any current policy by keeping it. The other waitress reported the incident, leading to the new policy, but the author's decision is up to them. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The staff might expect tips to be shared in some way, but the previous policy didn't enforce that. The author is in a financial bind, and the owners gave them the choice. Since there's no rule forcing them to share, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. They're following the owners' current directive. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
