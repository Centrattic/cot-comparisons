Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners previously turned a blind eye but are now enforcing the policy more strictly. The author got a $2k tip from a big customer, and there's a debate about whether they should share it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, even if it wasn't strictly enforced before, the new policy now requires that any tips go into a common fund. The author was given a choice to keep the tip they already received but to not accept any in the future. So the key here is whether the author is being asked to share past tips that were already given under the old, more lenient policy.\n\nThe author argues that they don't want to share because they're not rich and need the money for the holidays. The waitress who reported them might feel that since the policy is now in place, all tips should be shared. But the owners didn't force the author to share the existing tip, only to comply with the new policy moving forward. So the author is in a gray area here. They weren't explicitly told to share the past tip, but maybe there's an unspoken expectation among the staff that tips should be pooled. \n\nBut if the owners allowed them to keep the tip, then technically they aren't violating the new policy by keeping it. The question is about moral obligation. If the author is being selfish by not sharing when others might be affected, but the policy change was recent, and the tip was received before the policy was enforced. The waitress who reported them might feel that if one person can keep a tip, others might too, leading to unfairness. However, the author wasn't asked to share it, just to stop accepting tips in the future. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the owners didn't require sharing of past tips. However, if the common practice among the staff was to pool tips even before the policy, then the author might be seen as being unfair. But since the owners didn't enforce it before and now are only enforcing it going forward, the author's choice to keep the existing tip might be justified. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the owners allowed them to keep it, and the policy change is about future tips. However, if there's an expectation of sharing among the staff, then the author is in the wrong. But the scenario doesn't mention any prior agreement about sharing tips. The waitress reported the author, but the owners didn't mandate sharing the existing tip. So the author is not in the wrong by the policy's terms, but maybe morally questionable. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be A or B. Given the owners gave the author the choice, the answer is B.\n"
