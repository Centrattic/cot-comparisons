Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a waiter who received a $2,000 tip from a customer at a restaurant that officially doesn't allow tipping. The restaurant's policy was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach until the new waitress reported the incident, leading to a stricter policy. Now, the author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it with others, which would leave them with only $150. They're conflicted and asking if they're in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a lenient policy before, but after the new waitress reported the tip, they changed it to a strict policy. The key point here is whether the waiter knew about the policy and the implications of accepting tips. Since the policy was informal and not strictly enforced until now, the waiter might not have considered it a formal rule they had to follow.\n\nNext, the ownership's response: they allowed the waiter to decide whether to keep the tip but mentioned that future tips must be put into a common fund. The question is whether the waiter is obligated to share the previous tip now. Since the owners didn't enforce the policy before, and the new policy is only for the future, there's an argument that the $2,000 was received under the old, more lenient policy. Therefore, the waiter might not have a moral obligation to share it.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of fairness among the staff. Other waiters might feel it's unfair that someone kept a large tip when the new policy requires sharing. But since the tip happened before the new policy was enforced, the waiter isn't violating the current rules. The owners didn't explicitly state that past tips need to be shared, so the waiter might not be in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nAlso, the personal circumstances are important. The waiter is not wealthy, and the holidays will be hard. The tip is a significant amount for them. If sharing would leave them with just $150, keeping it makes sense for their own financial planning.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the restaurant is a non-tipping establishment, tips should inherently go to the staff pool. But the previous policy allowed for tips to be kept, and the ownership didn't enforce it before. The change in policy is a new rule, but the existing tip was under the old rules. So, the waiter might not have a duty to comply with the new policy retroactively for past earnings.\n\nIn conclusion, the waiter isn't necessarily in the wrong because the tip was received under the previous policy, and the new policy doesn't retroactively apply to past incidents. The decision to keep the tip is personal and based on their financial needs, and the ownership didn't explicitly require sharing it.\n"
