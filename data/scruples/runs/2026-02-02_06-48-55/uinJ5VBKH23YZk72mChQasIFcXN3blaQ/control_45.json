Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The staff, including the author, is supposed to ignore tips, but sometimes customers still leave them. The owners have been turning a blind eye until now. The author got a huge tip from a well-known customer, kept it, and now the other waiters are upset because they found out and want it split. The question is whether keeping the tip makes the author the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners said not to accept tips under any circumstances, but in the past, they sort of allowed it as long as it was under the radar. The author kept the tip because the owners told them they could keep it for that instance, but they're now enforcing a strict policy moving forward. The other waitress reported the author, leading to the meeting. The owners are now saying that future tips must go into a common fund, but the author's recent tip is a past event.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author had a right to keep the tip they received before the new policy. Since the policy changed after the fact, the author might argue that they were following the previous understanding. However, the owners might have expected that any tips received after the rule was established should be turned in, but the author's tip was before the rule was enforced. The owners gave them the choice to keep it, so there's some ambiguity.\n\nAlso, the author's argument is that they're not rich and need the money, especially around the holidays. The other waiters might feel unfair because if tips are to be shared, but the author kept it, it sets a bad precedent. However, the owners' statement said it's up to the author to decide. So if the owners allowed it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the owners expect all tips to be shared retroactively, the author could be in the wrong for not complying with the new policy, even if it was applied after the fact.\n\nAnother angle is fairness. If the new policy requires sharing tips, but the author kept their previous tip, others might see it as unfair. However, the owners didn't explicitly say to share past tips, only future ones. So the author's decision to keep it might be justified based on the owners' statement. But maybe there's an unspoken expectation of fairness among the staff, regardless of the owners' policy.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the owners' statement about past tips allows the author to keep it. If the owners said it's up to them, then the author isn't wrong. However, if the new policy implies that all tips should be shared, but the author kept one they received under the old policy, that's a gray area. The answer might hinge on the owners' explicit permission versus the staff's expectations of fairness.\n"
