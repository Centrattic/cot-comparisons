Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye, allowing tips to be kept by the individual server. Now, after a large tip incident, the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The author received a $2k tip from an NBA player, which was reported by a coworker, leading to a meeting where it's decided that future tips must go into a common fund. However, the author is allowed to keep this particular tip. The question is whether they should share it with the other waiters.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the restaurant's policy, the owners' previous leniency, the new strict policy, and the author's decision to keep the tip. The author is wondering if they're a \"tit for tat\" (AITA) for not sharing.\n\nIn traditional tipping scenarios, especially in places where tips are pooled or shared, it's common to distribute tips among the staff. However, in this case, the restaurant explicitly states a no-tipping policy, but there was a period where they allowed individual tips. Now, the policy is changing. The author received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners are giving them the choice to keep it, but the other waiters are upset because they now expect a share.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they worked hard for the tip, it's a significant amount for them, and they're not in a position to share it, especially with upcoming holidays. They don't want to be seen as a bad person, though.\n\nLegally, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners allowed exceptions. Now, they are enforcing the policy, but the author's case is grandfathered in. The ethical question is whether they should share it now, given that others might expect it, even if the policy is changing.\n\nIn many restaurants, especially those that claim not to tip, the expectation is that tips go into a pool for all staff. However, in this case, the owners previously allowed individual tips, so there's a bit of a gray area. The author might argue that since the tip was allowed under the previous policy, it's their right to keep it. Others might argue that even though the policy changed, the large tip should be shared because it's against the restaurant's stated policy, and fairness among staff matters.\n\nAnother angle is the social contract among coworkers. If others are upset because they didn't get a share, the author might be seen as selfish. However, the author also has personal financial struggles, which adds to their justification.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the outcome often depends on the intent and the context. If the restaurant's policy is clear that tips belong to the staff as a whole, then the author would be in the wrong. But here, the policy was ambiguous. The owners allowed tips before, and now they're enforcing it strictly, but in this case, they're allowing the author to keep it. So, the restaurant's inconsistency might be part of the issue.\n\nThe key is that the author is being asked to share a windfall they received under a previous policy. If the other waiters didn't get tips, maybe they feel it's unfair. However, the author might not be obligated to share it if the policy allowed them to keep it. The owners' decision to let the author keep it might imply that it's acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. The restaurant's policy is unclear, and the owners have been inconsistent. The author's decision to keep the tip isn't necessarily wrong, especially since the owners allowed it. However, sharing could be seen as the more ethical choice to maintain good relations with coworkers. But since the owners are giving them the choice, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it.\n"
