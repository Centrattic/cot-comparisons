Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing their tip with the other waiters in a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but sometimes customers leave tips anyway. The owners have been turning a blind eye in the past, but after a recent incident where someone reported a tip, they've decided to enforce the policy more strictly. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, and now the management is saying they can choose to keep it, but if they do, they might be expected to share it with others in the future. The author is considering keeping the tip but is conflicted because they don't want to be seen as a bad person.\n\nSo, the key points are: the restaurant's policy, the employees' expectations, and the management's new ruling. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the tip.\n\nFrom the management's perspective, they had a policy against tipping, but now they're enforcing it. They told the author that they can keep the tip in this case but implied that future tips should be shared. The author might be in a gray area because the policy wasn't clearly enforced before. However, since the management has now set a rule, the author is following the current instruction to keep this tip but might need to comply with future sharing. The other waiters might feel it's unfair that the author keeps it while they might have to share in the future. \n\nBut the management's response was that it's up to the author to keep it, so maybe they're not obligated to share. However, the employee's decision could affect team dynamics. If others feel it's unfair, the author might be seen as selfish. But the management's policy might not require sharing this time. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the policy. If management allowed keeping past tips and now are saying future ones must be shared, the author is following the current rule. However, the other employees might feel that since the policy is now enforced, all tips should be shared, including past ones. But management didn't say to share the $2000; they just said it's up to the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong legally or per management's policy, but there's a moral aspect where others might feel it's unfair. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're following management's directive, but the user might think A (in the wrong) because of fairness to the team. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so I need to consider that. But according to the situation, the management allowed keeping it, so maybe the author isn't wrong.\n"
