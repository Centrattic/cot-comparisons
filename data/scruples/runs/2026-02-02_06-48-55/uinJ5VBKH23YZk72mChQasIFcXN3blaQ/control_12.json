Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a waiter who got a $2000 tip from a customer at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before. Now, after someone reported this instance, the owners are enforcing a stricter policy and the author is debating whether to keep the tip or share it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had been turning a blind eye before, so maybe the employees thought it was okay to keep tips individually. However, now they've changed the policy to require tips to go into a common fund. The author received this tip before the policy change, so the owners told them it's up to them whether to keep it or not. The key here is that the author's previous actions were based on an informal understanding, but now things have changed.\n\nThe author is being asked to split the tip with others, but keeping it would mean keeping most of it for themselves. The other waitresses were upset, especially the one who reported it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the restaurant had a common fund policy in place now, even retroactively, the author might be expected to comply. However, since the tip was given before the policy changed, and the owners allowed the author to decide, maybe they have a right to keep it. But there's a social expectation in some work environments to share tips, especially if it's a common practice even if not officially enforced.\n\nThe author argues that they're not rich and need the money for holidays. On the other hand, not sharing could be seen as selfish. However, since the owners didn't require sharing in the past and allowed the author to keep it now, maybe it's not the author's fault. The policy change is new, but the tip was received under the old policy.\n\nI think the main point is whether the author should be held to the new policy retroactively. If the owners allowed the tip to be kept, then the author isn't in the wrong. The other waitresses might be upset, but the decision was made by the owners to let the author decide. So the author isn't obligated to split it now. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
