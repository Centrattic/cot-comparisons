Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but occasionally customers leave tips anyway. The owners have been turning a blind eye, but now they're enforcing the policy strictly after new staff complained. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, and when the owner asks if they should keep it or share, the author is considering keeping it but feels conflicted about being a \"terrible person.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the policy is that tips are to be shared among the staff or turned over to a common fund, then the author might be in the wrong by keeping it. However, the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, given the past leniency. The new policy is now strict, so maybe the author should comply with the new rules moving forward, but the tip in question happened before the policy change. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're not rich and need the money for the holidays. But the other waiters might also need it, especially if the policy is about sharing. The question is whether the author should follow the existing policy or the new one. Since the owners gave discretion, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. However, the fact that others might expect to share could make them in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are the restaurant's policy and the discretion given by the owners. Since the owners allowed keeping the tip, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe they should consider splitting it to maintain good relations. But the question is if they are in the wrong, not what they should do. The answer is probably A (yes) if the policy requires sharing, but if the owners allowed discretion, then B (no). The owners said it's up to the author, so maybe B is correct.\n"
