Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye to it in the past. The person received a $2,000 tip from a customer, and now after the policy was enforced, they're being asked if they'll share it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners have now made it clear that tips must be turned into a common fund, but in this case, they gave the person an out to keep the tip. So technically, the person isn't violating any new rules by keeping it. The previous practice was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which might imply that even before, the tips weren't supposed to be kept, but the owners didn't enforce it. Now, the new policy is strict, but the owners allowed this specific instance to be an exception.\n\nThe person is in a tight financial situation, living in a studio apartment and working hard. The tip is a significant amount for them, especially with holidays coming up. The other waitress reported them, but the owners didn't punish them, just advised to turn in tips in the future. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for keeping the tip now when the policy has changed.\n\nLegally, if the restaurant's policy is that all tips go into a common fund, then keeping the tip could be against the policy. But the owners gave them a choice in this specific case. Ethically, it's more about fairness. If other staff are expected to turn in their tips, and this person is also a waiter, maybe there's an expectation of sharing. However, the owners allowed them to keep this one because it was before the policy change. The key here is that the owners didn't force them to share, so maybe the person isn't in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The tip was given in a situation where the policy wasn't strictly enforced before. The person might not have known that tips were supposed to be shared. Now that the policy is strict, but in this case, they were allowed to keep it. The person is choosing not to share out of personal need, which is understandable. The other waitress's complaint might be based on a new policy that wasn't in place when the tip was given. So, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because the policy was ambiguous before, and the owners gave them discretion in this case.\n\nAlso, the amount is $2,000, which is a lot, but if they were to share it, they'd only keep $150. That's a big difference, and the person is in a tough spot financially. The owners' response seems lenient, so the person isn't breaking any current rules by keeping it. Ethically, maybe there's a case for sharing, but legally or policy-wise, they're allowed to keep it. Therefore, the answer would be that they aren't in the wrong.\n"
