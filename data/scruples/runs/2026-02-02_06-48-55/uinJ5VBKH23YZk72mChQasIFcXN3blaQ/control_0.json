Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong (AITA) for not sharing a $2000 tip with their fellow waiters. The restaurant has a \"non-tipping\" policy but the owner turned a blind eye, allowing tips but not officially. The situation came up when an NBA player left a $2000 tip, and the author kept it after the owner said it's up to them whether to share it. Now the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy was non-tipping, but the owner allowed tips unofficially. Then, after an incident, they decided to enforce the policy strictly, making it so any tips must go into a common fund. The author received a tip before this policy was enforced and now the owner is giving them a choice to keep it or share. The author is considering keeping it but feels bad about it.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the owner's response. The tip was given before the new policy was enforced. The owner's statement that it's up to the author suggests there's no obligation to share. However, the author is part of a team, and others might feel the tip should be shared because it's part of the service. But since the owner allowed the tip to be kept, the author isn't breaking the new rule by holding onto it. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because the owner explicitly said it's their choice. The new policy applies to future tips, not past ones. The author's decision is personal and within the owner's discretion. The other waiters might be upset, but the owner's words make it clear the author isn't obligated to share. So the answer is B (No).\n"
