Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a base salary and a policy against tipping, but they turned a blind eye sometimes. The author got a huge tip from an NBA player, kept it, and now other waiters are upset and the management is enforcing the no-tipping policy strictly now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners previously had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach but are now enforcing the policy. The author was allowed to keep the tip in this instance, but future tips must go into a common fund. So the key here is whether the author is obligated to share the tip they already received.\n\nThe other waiters might feel it's unfair because they followed the policy when the author didn't. However, the management didn't require the author to share the tip, even though they're now changing the rules. The author's decision to keep the money could be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency. But the management explicitly said it's up to the author to decide. \n\nEthically, if the policy is now being strictly enforced and the author benefited under the old rules, sharing might be expected to maintain fairness. However, the management didn't enforce sharing in this case, so the author isn't legally or strictly obligated. The user is struggling with being a \"terrible person\" but also needing the money. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the policy change is new and the tip was allowed to be kept, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the community expects sharing even under the old policy, then they might be. The answer hinges on the explicit permission from management and the existing policy. Since management allowed them to keep it, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
