Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end and has a non-tipping policy. The base salary for waiters is higher than usual, so maybe the owners expect that the service is good enough that they don't need tips. However, some customers still leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. But now they've decided to enforce the policy strictly, especially after someone reported a large tip.\n\nThe author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player after a big bill. When the owner found out, they said it's up to the author whether to keep it or not, but future tips would go into a common fund. The other waitress who reported it is now asking about sharing it. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for their own needs and not wanting to be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, the main points here are the restaurant's policy and the fairness among the staff. The owners allowed the tip in the past but are now changing the rules. If the author is given the choice to keep it, maybe the owners are acknowledging that the new policy won't apply retroactively. But the other waiters are upset, so there's a social aspect too.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant had a no-tipping policy, any tips should go to the restaurant, but since the owners turned a blind eye before, maybe there's an implied agreement. Now they're tightening the policy, but the author received the tip before the policy was enforced. If the owners say it's up to the author, maybe they're allowing them to keep it. \n\nBut the author is considering keeping the tip. Is that wrong? From a fairness perspective among coworkers, if other waiters are following the new policy, but the author got a large tip before the policy changed, maybe they should share it. But the owners didn't force them to. The author's situation is that they're not rich and need the money. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if the owners didn't require sharing. However, there's a moral obligation to share if the staff expects tips to be split. But the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the restaurant's policy was clear from the start that all tips are shared, then the author would be wrong. But in this case, the policy was relaxed before, and the owners are now changing it. The author might not be at fault for keeping the tip if the owners allowed it. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that the owners are now enforcing a policy might mean that past tips should also be shared, but the owners gave the author the choice. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to keep it. The key is whether the restaurant's policy was consistently applied. Since the owners allowed it before and now are making a new rule, the author's action might be justified. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the owners allowed the tip previously and now gave them the choice to keep it.\n"
