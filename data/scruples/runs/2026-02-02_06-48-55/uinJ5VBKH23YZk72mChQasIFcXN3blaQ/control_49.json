Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owner's policy was previously a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, but now they're enforcing it strictly. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer, which is against the policy. The owners told them it's up to them whether to keep it or share it, but the author is considering keeping the whole amount.\n\nNow, considering the scenario: The restaurant's policy is clear now, and the author was part of a system where tips were sometimes allowed in the past. The key points here are the establishment's policy and the potential for unfairness among staff. Since the restaurant is non-tipping and the author kept the tip without sharing, others might feel it's unfair, especially since the new policy now requires sharing. The author's decision might be seen as taking advantage of the old policy loopholes, which could be considered wrong in the context of the new rules and fairness to colleagues.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the author wasn't explicitly told to share it. The owners left the decision to them. However, the fact that the new policy is about sharing tips and the author is benefiting from a previous exception might make them complicit in undermining the new policy. It's a bit of a gray area, but the consensus often leans towards sharing if the policy now requires it, even if it's not enforced retroactively. The author's financial situation is a personal hardship, but the issue is about fairness to others and adherence to the new policy. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they should share the tip to maintain fairness and respect the new policy, even if it's not enforced retroactively.\n"
