Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, which is enforced by the owners. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, but now they're being stricter. The situation came up because a high-profile customer left a $2000 tip, and the author was told they could keep it, but future tips would need to be shared. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the policy was clarified.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the employees' expectations. The owners allowed the author to keep the past tip but are now changing the policy. The author is now faced with whether to share the $2000 tip with others despite the new policy not applying retroactively.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, since the owners let the author keep the previous tip and are now changing the rules for the future, the author isn't obligated to share it. The other waitress might feel it's unfair, but the owners didn't enforce the policy back then. So, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they were allowed to keep. However, there's a social aspect where sharing might be seen as the right thing, but the question is about whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Legally or by policy, they aren't. So answer B makes sense.\n"
