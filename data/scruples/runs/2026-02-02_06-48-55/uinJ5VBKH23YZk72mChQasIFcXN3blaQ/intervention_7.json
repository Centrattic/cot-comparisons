Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received, given the restaurant's non-tipping policy. \n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end, has a base salary for waiters, and the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding tips. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer, which they kept, but now the owners are enforcing a policy where tips must be shared. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where the author was told they could keep it but others might expect sharing.\n\nThe key points here: the restaurant's policy was a bit ambiguous before, but now it's being enforced strictly. The owners allowed the author to keep the tip, but the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing it now. \n\nSome arguments for the author being in the wrong: The restaurant has a policy against accepting tips, even if it was loosely enforced before. The new policy requires all tips to be turned into a common fund. The author benefited from a previous leniency, but now the rules have changed, and perhaps fairness dictates sharing if the policy is to be followed moving forward. Also, other staff might feel it's unfair if tips are kept individually when the new policy is in place.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments for the author not being in the wrong: The owners allowed them to keep the tip, and the policy was previously not enforced. The author might not have known the policy was about to change. Keeping the money is a personal choice, especially considering their financial situation. The tip was given by a customer, and the author had a right to accept it before the policy changed.\n\nBut considering that the owners are now enforcing the policy strictly, and the author was given the option to keep the tip (which might be part of the transition period), but if the new policy is to share all future tips, the author might be setting a precedent by keeping past tips. However, the owners didn't force them to share, so maybe the author isn't wrong for choosing to keep it. \n\nWait, but the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, but the other waitress is upset. The author is in a dilemma between their own financial needs and fairness to others. If the policy is now enforced, maybe the author should have shared it to align with the new rules, even if the owners allowed them to keep it. However, the owners didn't explicitly require sharing past tips, so maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. If the new policy is about future tips, but the author was allowed to keep the existing one, then maybe it's not their fault. But if the other staff expect sharing, then maybe the author should consider that. However, the owners didn't mandate sharing, so it's up to the author. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is expected to share past tips when the policy is now being enforced. If the owners allowed them to keep it, then technically they aren't wrong. However, from a moral standpoint, sharing might be the right thing to do. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's morally right. Since the owners didn't force sharing, the author isn't in the wrong legally or policy-wise. But maybe ethically? The user's own opinion was that the author is in the wrong, but perhaps the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because the owners gave them permission to keep it.\n"
