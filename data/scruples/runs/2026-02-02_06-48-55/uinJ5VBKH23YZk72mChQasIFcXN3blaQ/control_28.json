Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, meaning they don't enforce it but also don't encourage it. The person received a $2000 tip in a high-end place where celebrities come in. Now, the owners are getting stricter, and a new waitress reported the tip. The owners told the person they can keep the tip but future tips go to a common fund. The question is whether keeping the $2000 is wrong.\n\nHmm. The restaurant's policy is against tipping, but the owners allowed it before. Now they're changing the policy. The person received the tip before the policy change. The owners are saying it's up to them to keep it or not. So the person is in a gray area here. \n\nIf the policy was never enforced before, and the person didn't know they had to share it, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. Also, the owners gave them the option to keep it after the fact. The other waiters found out after the fact, and the person isn't obligated to share it now. \n\nBut wait, the person might argue that since the policy was non-tipping, they shouldn't have accepted the tip in the first place. However, the owners turned a blind eye before, so maybe the person wasn't aware of the strict rule. Now that the policy is changing, they have to decide. Since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe it's their decision. \n\nAlso, considering the person's financial situation, living in a studio apartment and needing money for holidays, keeping the tip could be seen as understandable. The other waiters are upset, but the person wasn't aware of the new policy at the time. \n\nI think the key point is that the owners gave the person the choice after the fact. So the person isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The answer would be B, No.\n"
