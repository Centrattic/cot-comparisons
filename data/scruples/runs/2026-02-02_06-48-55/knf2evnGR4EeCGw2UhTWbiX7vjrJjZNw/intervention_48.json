When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a sibling who asked their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister is older, and the author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying that caused the self-harm. The sister got upset when the author mentioned it.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intent and the sister's reaction. The author didn't mean to hurt their sister but mentioned it casually, leading to her crying. The author is worried about being selfish. On one hand, the author's feelings are valid\u2014seeing scars can be distressing, especially if they're linked to past trauma. On the other hand, the sister's autonomy is important. She might feel that her scars are a part of her history that she's okay with, or she might not want to be reminded of the trauma. \n\nThe author's approach was to mention it casually, which might not have been the best way to address their discomfort. Maybe a more supportive way would be to express their feelings without directly asking the sister to cover up. The sister's reaction shows that the mention was hurtful, even if unintended. The author might have overstepped by focusing on their own discomfort rather than supporting their sister's comfort with her own body. \n\nAlso, the sister is in recovery, so the author's comment could trigger her again. Even though the author's intention was to avoid the painful reminder, they need to balance their feelings with the sister's emotional state. The fact that the author feels bad about it afterward suggests they care, but the method of addressing it was problematic. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with enough sensitivity to their sister's feelings and autonomy.\n"
