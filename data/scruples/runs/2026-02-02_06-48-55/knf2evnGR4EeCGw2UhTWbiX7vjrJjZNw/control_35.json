When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author feels upset seeing the scars, even though they acknowledge it's not about them. The sister got upset after the author mentioned the scars.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems to be to avoid triggering sadness, not to judge or criticize their sister. They admit they're not in a position to tell her what to do and are concerned for her well-being. However, bringing up the scars might inadvertently make the sister feel self-conscious or like her past is being brought up. The author's emotional reaction is valid, but the way they approached the sister might not have been the best.\n\nThe key points are: the sister is an adult, the author didn't confront her about the scars but mentioned them casually, leading to the sister's distress. The author is in a tough spot because they care but are struggling with their feelings. The sister might feel that the author is prying or that her past is being judged, even if that's not the case. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to communicate their feelings honestly, but they need a better approach. However, since the sister was hurt by the comment, the author might have overstepped by bringing it up, even if unintentionally. So, the answer could be A (author is wrong) because they didn't handle it sensitively, leading to the sister's upset. Alternatively, B (not wrong) because they're trying to express their feelings but need a better method. I think the correct answer is A because the author's action, though well-intentioned, hurt the sister's feelings. They should have considered the emotional impact first.\n"
