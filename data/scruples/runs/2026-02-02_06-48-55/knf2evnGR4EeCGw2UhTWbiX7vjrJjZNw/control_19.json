When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their sister to cover self-harm scars, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying. The author mentioned this casually, and the sister got upset. The author is now questioning their actions.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's intentions. The author acknowledges that the sister has come a long way and isn't trying to judge her. They also realize they might be being selfish and that it's not about them. However, the sister's reaction was negative, which makes the author feel guilty.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the sister's scars are a result of past trauma. The author's reaction is based on their own emotions, which might not consider the sister's current feelings about the scars. The sister might view her scars as private or a reminder of her struggle, and the author's comment could be seen as intrusive, even if made casually. The sister's emotional response indicates that the comment was hurtful.\n\nThe author's intention wasn't to criticize but to express discomfort. However, the impact of their words caused distress. In such cases, the focus is usually on the impact rather than the intent. The author's statement might have made the sister feel judged or that her past is a topic that shouldn't be mentioned. The sister's right to feel comfortable with her body and her healing process is important. The author's reaction might not consider the sister's perspective fully, leading to the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the author's action, though not malicious, was probably inconsiderate of the sister's feelings. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they brought up a sensitive topic without considering how it might affect their sister, leading to emotional harm.\n"
