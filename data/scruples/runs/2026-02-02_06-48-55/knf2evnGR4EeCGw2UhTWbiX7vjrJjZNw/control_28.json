When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author, who's younger, is upset seeing the scars and mentioned it once, causing the sister to get upset and cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has overcome a lot and is now doing better. The author is expressing their feelings about seeing the scars but realizes it's about their own emotional reaction. The sister might feel that the author is bringing up the past or making her uncomfortable. The key points are the author's intent and the sister's reaction.\n\nThe author says they don't want to tell her what to do but are upset because it affects their own emotions. However, by bringing up the scars, even casually, the author might have triggered the sister. The sister's emotional response suggests that the topic is still sensitive. The author's action, while coming from a place of sadness and anger about the past, might not consider the sister's current feelings about her scars. It's possible that the author's comment, even if well-meaning, is not something the sister wants to discuss, especially if she's moved past that chapter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address their own emotional distress. But the problem is that they're imposing their feelings on the sister. The sister's autonomy and her comfort in her own home should be considered. The author's mention of the scars, even if done in a casual way, might be seen as making a request to cover them, which could be a form of pressure. The sister might feel that her body and how she presents it is a personal choice, and the author's reaction is infringing on that.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to avoid feeling sad around the sister, but that's not a valid reason to ask someone to cover their scars. It's important to respect the other person's boundaries and choices, even if it affects one's own emotions. The sister has worked hard to heal, and the author's comment might undermine her progress by bringing up the past in a negative way. The author could be in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings about the scars and how their comment might be received. They should have approached the situation more sensitively, maybe by addressing their own feelings without making a request of the sister. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
