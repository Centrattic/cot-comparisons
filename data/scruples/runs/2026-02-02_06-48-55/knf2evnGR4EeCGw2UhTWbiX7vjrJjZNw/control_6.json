When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author, a younger sibling, is upset by their older sister's visible self-harm scars. The sister is living at home, and the author mentions that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad, leading to a strained relationship after a conversation about the scars.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Self-harm is a serious issue, and the sister went through a lot with bullying and therapy. The author acknowledges not being in the right position to tell her what to do, which shows some self-awareness. However, they still expressed discomfort, which upset the sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent and impact. The author's intention wasn't to hurt their sister, but their words did cause emotional pain. The sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the comment was hurtful. Even if the author meant to express concern or their own feelings, the way it was communicated might have been inappropriate. The author also admits to feeling selfish, which suggests they recognize the other person's autonomy and the fact that the scars are part of their sister's history.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the action (mentioning the scars) was unkind or overstepped boundaries. While the author's feelings are valid, the sister has the right to her body and how she presents herself. The author's reaction might stem from their own emotions rather than respecting their sister's current comfort level. However, the author didn't force the sister to cover the scars; they just expressed their feelings, which led to a negative reaction. \n\nBut the sister's well-being and autonomy are important. If the author's comments caused distress, even if unintended, then there's a case for the author being in the wrong. The sister might feel re-traumatized by the comment, especially if the scars are a sensitive topic for her. The author should focus on managing their own emotions and perhaps find ways to support their sister without making her feel judged, rather than asking her to cover the scars. \n\nSo, considering the impact on the sister and the fact that the author's comment was unkind and caused pain, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A). However, there's also the aspect of the author struggling with their own feelings. But in terms of right or wrong, the wrong here is in how the author handled their feelings in a way that hurt someone else.\n"
