When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying, and the author feels upset seeing them, which affects their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's been through a lot, and the scars are a part of her history. The author admits they've never experienced self-harm and don't want to tell her what to do. But bringing up the scars, even casually, made the sister cry. That suggests the scars are a sensitive topic for her. \n\nThe author's intention was to express their discomfort but maybe didn't realize how triggering it could be for their sister. However, the sister's emotional reaction shows that the scars are still a painful reminder. The author might be in a tough spot because they care about their sister but are struggling with their own feelings of sadness and anger when they see the scars.\n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author overstep by mentioning the scars? The sister got upset, so maybe the author didn't handle it well. The author says they don't want to be selfish, but bringing it up could have been seen as making it about their feelings rather than respecting her boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it's affecting their relationship. But in this case, the sister's well-being is important. The author might not understand the trauma associated with the scars. So, even if the intention was to address their own feelings, the approach could have been wrong. The sister's right to have her space and not be made uncomfortable by her sibling's request is crucial here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to communicate their feelings. But maybe the right way would be to talk about their own emotions without directly asking the sister to cover them up. However, since the author did ask her to cover them, that might be the problem. The sister has the right to her body and how she chooses to present herself, especially in her own home. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're coming from a place of care and wanting to protect their sister's feelings about the past. But the way they approached it was probably not the best. The sister's feelings are valid too, and the author should respect that the scars are a part of her history and that she might not want to hide them. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was to express their discomfort, but the method might have been inappropriate, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, the sister's reaction shows that the topic is sensitive, so the author needs to be more considerate of her feelings moving forward. The answer is likely A, as the author's request was inappropriate even if their intention was good.\n"
