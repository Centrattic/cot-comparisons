When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is older, and there's a history of bullying and therapy. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them angry. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister was upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. First, I need to consider the sister's feelings. Self-harm scars can be very personal, and the sister might not want to cover them for her own reasons. The author didn't tell her to cover them, just mentioned seeing them, which led to the sister's emotional reaction. The author is concerned about their own feelings affecting the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't force the sister to do anything, they expressed their feelings in a casual way, and they felt bad after. But the sister's reaction suggests that the mention of the scars was hurtful. The author might not realize that the scars are a sensitive topic for the sister now, even though she's recovered. The author's intention was to avoid seeing the scars because of their emotional reaction, but they didn't consider how bringing it up might affect the sister.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because even though they didn't directly ask her to cover them, bringing up the scars can be triggering or uncomfortable for someone who has a history of self-harm. The sister's emotional response shows that it was hurtful. The author should have considered their sister's feelings and maybe found another way to cope with their own emotions without discussing the scars. So the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
