When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has visible scars from when she was bullied and self-harmed. The author mentions that they feel sad and angry when they see the scars, which is affecting their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She has a history of self-harm and might have worked hard to overcome it. The scars are physical reminders of her past trauma. For someone who has experienced something like that, being asked to cover up the scars could feel like a demand to hide her pain or a lack of empathy for her past struggles. It's possible that the sister feels the scars are a part of her journey and that covering them might make her feel like she needs to hide her healing process.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own feelings of sadness and anger when they see the scars. They feel it's not about them, but it's affecting their emotional state. However, the author is not in a position to dictate what their sister should or shouldn't do with her body, especially given their own lack of experience with depression or self-harm. The comment was made in a moment of vulnerability, and the sister's emotional response indicates that the author's approach might have been insensitive.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and autonomy. The sister has the right to decide how she presents her body. While the author's intentions might be to protect themselves from emotional distress, they need to consider the sister's feelings and boundaries. It's important for the author to manage their own emotions rather than place the burden on their sister to accommodate those feelings. The author's approach could be seen as invalidating the sister's experiences and recovery journey.\n\nAdditionally, the sister getting upset and crying suggests that the author's words triggered distress. The author immediately felt bad and realized they shouldn't have said that, which indicates they understand the harm caused. The sister might feel that her past trauma is being brought up in a way that's not supportive, or that her autonomy is being questioned.\n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are valid, how they expressed those feelings was inappropriate. They should have focused on processing their own emotions without imposing their comfort level on their sister. The sister's autonomy and feelings should take precedence here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
