When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister's self-harm scars and the author's reaction to them.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying when she was 17. The author is 4 years younger, and now the sister is home after university looking for a job. The author says they're proud of her progress but the scars still make them feel sad and angry. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset and cried. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to bring it up.\n\nSo, the main points here are about empathy and boundaries. The author is struggling with their own emotions about the scars, which aren't their own experience. They wanted to ask the sister to cover them, but that request led to conflict. The sister's reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive and possibly triggering for her. \n\nSelf-harm scars are a personal and private issue. The sister might have worked hard to recover and may not want to be reminded of that painful time, especially by someone else's comments. The author's intention might have been to avoid seeing the scars because they make them sad, but that's a personal reaction, not the sister's problem to manage. \n\nThe author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell the sister what to do, which is a good start. However, by bringing up the scars, even casually, they might have unintentionally reopened old wounds. The sister's emotional response indicates that this was a sensitive topic for her. \n\nIn such situations, the person with the history of self-harm has the right to decide how they want to present themselves, especially in their own home. The author's request for the sister to cover her scars might be seen as invalidating her recovery journey or implying that the scars are something to be hidden. This could be perceived as a lack of support, which is why the sister was upset.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by commenting on the scars. While the author's feelings are valid, the way they expressed them might have been inconsiderate. The sister's well-being and autonomy should take precedence. The author needs to respect the sister's boundaries and find ways to cope with their own emotions without imposing on the sister's choices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they brought up a sensitive topic that hurt their sister, even if unintentionally. Their actions, though coming from a place of concern, crossed a boundary and affected their sister negatively.\n"
