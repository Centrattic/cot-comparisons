When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is talking about their sister, who is four years older and currently at home looking for a job. The sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying when she was 17. The parents eventually got her therapy, and she's recovered a lot but still has noticeable scars. The author feels upset when seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. They tried to mention it casually, which upset their sister. Now they're worried about their relationship and if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's perspective. She had a traumatic experience and has scars as a result. The author's sister might feel vulnerable or embarrassed about the scars. Even though the author didn't mean to criticize, bringing up the scars in a casual way might have been triggering or made her feel like her past is being judged. The sister's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that the conversation was hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly concerned and supportive, as they mention being proud of her progress. They don't want to judge her but are struggling with their own emotions. However, the key issue here is whether the author had the right to bring up the scars in the first place. Since the author isn't in a position to tell their sister what to do, especially given their own lack of experience with self-harm, commenting on the scars might be projecting their own feelings onto their sister. The author's emotional response is valid, but expressing it in a way that makes their sister feel upset might be inappropriate. \n\nThe author's approach seems to lack sensitivity. Instead of focusing on their own feelings (anger at the bullying), they should have considered how their sister would react. The sister might prefer not to have those scars discussed or might feel that the past is a sensitive topic. The author's action, while coming from a place of concern, didn't consider the sister's emotional state and boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's mention of being \"selfish\" by saying it's not about them is important. Even if it's not their intention to be selfish, the focus on their own discomfort without addressing their sister's autonomy could be seen as self-centered. The right approach might have been to seek support for their own feelings (like talking to a counselor) rather than confronting their sister about the scars.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the sister's distress and the resulting tension suggest that the conversation wasn't handled well. The author needs to take responsibility for how their words were perceived, even if their intention was good. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author likely did overstep by bringing up the scars in a way that upset their sister. They should focus on their own emotional processing and find healthier ways to cope without burdening their sister. Therefore, the answer is probably A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
