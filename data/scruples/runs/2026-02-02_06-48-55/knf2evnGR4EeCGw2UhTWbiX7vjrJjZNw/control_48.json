When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which was addressed with therapy. She's older, living at home, and the author is upset when seeing the scars. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset, leading to relationship tension.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention isn't to judge but to express discomfort, but the sister felt hurt. The author acknowledges not being in the right position to tell her what to do. However, bringing up the scars might have been a sensitive topic. The author's reaction is based on their feelings of sadness and anger towards the past bullying, but they recognize it's not about them.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's action was a conversation, not a demand. They mentioned it casually, not as an order. But the sister's emotional response indicates that the topic is still sensitive. The author might have overstepped by mentioning it, even if well-intentioned, because it's the sister's body and her choice to cover or not. The author's upset is about their own feelings, which is valid, but the sister's autonomy is also important. \n\nHowever, the author tried to address it without being confrontational. The problem is whether the author had the right to bring it up. Since the scars are a result of past trauma, the sister might feel that her privacy or recovery is being invaded. The author's intention was to express their own distress, not to criticize, but the way it was done might not have considered the sister's current emotional state. \n\nSo, while the author isn't malicious, they might have been inconsiderate of the sister's feelings, making them at least partially at fault. But the sister's reaction could also be part of her healing process. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author approached it casually and felt bad afterward, maybe the answer is A (Yes), because even though their intentions were good, they didn't consider the sister's boundaries. Alternatively, maybe B (No), because they were trying to express their feelings without forcing anything.\n\nHmm. The key is whether the author was wrong to mention it. In many cases, discussing someone else's scars, especially self-harm, is a sensitive issue. Unless there's a current risk, it's not the other person's place to comment. The author's action, while not malicious, might have been intrusive. So the answer is A (Yes), they are in the wrong for bringing it up without respecting the sister's autonomy and boundaries.\n"
