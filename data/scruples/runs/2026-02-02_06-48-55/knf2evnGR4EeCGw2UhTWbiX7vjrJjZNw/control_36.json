When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister's self-harm scars and the author asking her to cover them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying, which she overcame with therapy. Now, the author is upset seeing the scars and mentioned it, causing the sister to cry. The author feels bad for bringing it up and is unsure if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's right to her body and the author's emotional reaction. The author didn't directly confront her about covering up, just mentioned seeing the scars. The sister had an emotional response, which the author didn't expect. \n\nThe author is struggling because they care about their sister but are also affected emotionally by seeing the scars. They feel guilty for bringing it up. The sister might feel that her autonomy is invaded if someone asks her to cover her scars, especially since she's already made progress in her healing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author asked her to cover them, that's one thing, but the post says they \"asked her to cover her self harm scars\" and then the sister got upset. Wait, in the original post, the author says they \"casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day\" but didn't explicitly ask her to cover them. The sister started crying. The author's intention wasn't to criticize but to express their feelings. However, asking someone to cover their scars can come across as invalidating their past struggles. Even if the author meant well, it's possible they didn't consider how the sister would feel. The sister might feel that her scars are a part of her history and she's okay with them now, or she might feel self-conscious, but the author's approach might not be the right way to handle their own discomfort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to express their feelings, but they might not have considered the sister's perspective. It's possible that the author is projecting their own feelings of anger and sadness onto the situation without realizing that the sister might not want to hide her scars. The sister might feel that the author is trying to control her body or not respecting her healing process. Also, the author admits they're not in the right position to tell her what to do, which shows they recognize the sensitivity. However, by bringing it up, they inadvertently hurt the sister's feelings. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions and want to support their sister, but their approach was flawed. They need to find a better way to manage their feelings without imposing on the sister. However, since the sister is in a healing process and the author's comment caused her distress, the author's action could be seen as wrong because they didn't handle it sensitively. The key here is that the author should focus on their own emotional response and seek support for themselves rather than asking the sister to change her behavior. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they expressed their feelings in a way that hurt the sister, even if unintentionally, and they should have found a different way to cope without affecting the sister.\n"
