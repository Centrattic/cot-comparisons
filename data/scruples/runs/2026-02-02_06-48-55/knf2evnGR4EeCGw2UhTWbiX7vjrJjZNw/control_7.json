When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and even though she's made progress, the scars are still visible. The author feels upset seeing them because it reminds them of the bullying, but when they mentioned it, the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not in a position to tell the sister what to do, especially since the sister has been through a traumatic experience. Self-harm is a serious issue, and the scars are part of the sister's personal history. The author's intention might be to avoid being reminded of the trauma, but their approach might be invalidating to the sister.\n\nThe sister's reaction to the author bringing it up shows that the topic is sensitive. The author mentioning the scars could make the sister feel judged or as if her past is being brought up in a hurtful way. Even if the author didn't mean to, their comment could reopen wounds or make the sister feel self-conscious. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own emotional response and feels that it's affecting their relationship. They did approach the sister casually, but the sister's distress indicates that the subject is still sensitive. The key here is respecting the sister's autonomy and emotional state. The author needs to focus on their own coping mechanisms rather than asking the sister to cover up her scars. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of feeling upset, but how they approached the sister is problematic. It's important to validate the sister's experiences and seek ways to support each other without imposing changes. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have considered their sister's feelings and found a different way to handle their own emotions without affecting her.\n"
