When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a sister who self-harmed due to bullying when she was 17. The sister has recovered with therapy, but still has visible scars. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the past bullying. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried. Now the author is worried about their relationship and whether they did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the sister's scars are a result of past trauma, the author is not in a position to dictate her actions, and the author's comment upset the sister. The author is struggling with their feelings and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are often private and sensitive. Even if the sister is recovered, those scars might be a reminder of painful times. The sister might not want to hide them, maybe as a symbol of survival, or it could trigger her trauma if she's told to cover them. The author's comment might have been well-intentioned but could have unintentionally reopened wounds.\n\nFrom the author's side, they're expressing their discomfort and sadness, which is understandable. But the problem is that the author is projecting their own emotions onto the sister. The sister's autonomy is important here. The author isn't in a position to tell her what to do with her body, even if it's about covering scars. The sister might feel that the author is blaming her or not understanding her experience.\n\nThe sister's reaction\u2014crying\u2014suggests that the comment hurt her. The author realizes they're being selfish and that it's not about them. But the fact that their comment caused emotional distress means the author might have overstepped. The key here is respecting the sister's boundaries and choices, even if those choices make the author uncomfortable.\n\nIn terms of advice, the author should probably talk to their sister and apologize for bringing it up, and reassure her that they support her. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention wasn't malicious, but the action did cause harm. The sister's autonomy and emotional well-being are important, and the author might have crossed a boundary by commenting on her scars.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Because even though their feelings are valid, acting on them by commenting and causing distress to the sister was an overstep. The author should prioritize the sister's comfort and autonomy over their own discomfort, even if it's difficult.\n"
