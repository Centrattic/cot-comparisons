When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author is upset seeing these scars because it makes them angry and sad. They mentioned it to their sister once, and the sister got really upset and cried. Now the author is worried they're being selfish and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. It's a sensitive issue. The author is not in the same situation, so they don't have firsthand experience. They tried to bring it up casually but caused emotional distress. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're upset because the scars remind them of the bullying their sister went through. They feel it's not about them, but they're still bringing it up. The sister might feel that the author is prying or not respecting her privacy. Even if the author's intention was to express concern, the way they approached it might not have been the best. \n\nSelf-harm scars are personal. The sister might have chosen to keep them covered or not based on her own comfort. The author's reaction could be seen as imposing their own feelings onto the sister. It's important to validate the sister's experience and her right to handle her own recovery. The author's mention of the scars might have unintentionally triggered the sister, making her feel vulnerable again. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister got upset and cried suggests that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author should consider that bringing it up, even casually, might not be helpful. Instead of focusing on covering the scars, maybe the author should focus on supporting their sister emotionally in other ways. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's action was a single mention that caused distress. However, the underlying issue is that the author is projecting their own emotions onto the sister. They might not realize that the sister's autonomy in dealing with her scars is important. The key here is about respecting boundaries and not making the sister feel like she has to accommodate the author's discomfort. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they brought up a sensitive topic that affected their sister negatively, even if their intention was out of concern. It's about respecting her autonomy and privacy, rather than their own feelings.\n"
