When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister's self-harm scars and the author asking her to cover them. The sister is older, has a history of being bullied, got help, and the scars are still visible. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad, which is affecting their relationship. They brought it up once, the sister got upset, and now they're wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's been through a lot, and her scars are part of her past trauma. She might feel self-conscious or vulnerable about them. The author's sister might not want to cover them because it's a reminder of her pain, or maybe she's proud of overcoming it. The author's comment could have triggered her emotions, making her feel judged or retraumatized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in a position to tell their sister what to do with her body. They admit they're not in the right place to make that call. Their feelings are valid\u2014they're sad and angry about the sister's past. But expressing that by asking her to cover the scars might not be the right approach. It's possible the author's intention was to protect themselves from emotional pain, but they didn't consider how it affects the sister.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for autonomy. The sister has the right to choose how she presents her body. The author's request, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as imposing their own comfort on the sister. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is sensitive, and the author's approach might have been too direct or not empathetic enough. They should have perhaps focused on managing their own emotions without making a request of the sister.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was likely inconsiderate of the sister's feelings and autonomy. They might need to apologize and find a way to cope with their own emotions without pressuring the sister. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
