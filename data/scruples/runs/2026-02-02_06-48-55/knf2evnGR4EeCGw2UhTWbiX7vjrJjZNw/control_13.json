When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who has self-harm scars and the author is upset seeing them, leading them to mention it, which upset their sister.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to explain their feelings. They admit that it's not their place to tell their sister what to do, which is a good sign. They acknowledge the sister's past trauma and the progress she's made. The author's main issue is that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad because of the sister's past bullying. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't confront the sister about the self-harm itself, but about the visibility of the scars. The sister is an adult now, living at home, and the author is younger. The author's comment was made in a moment, maybe without considering the sister's current feelings about the scars. The sister's reaction was emotional, which suggests that the scars might still be a sensitive topic for her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't approach it in a confrontational way, but they did bring up the scars in a way that the sister found upsetting. The author's intention was to express their discomfort, but they didn't consider how that might affect their sister. The fact that the sister started crying shows that the author might have overstepped, even if unintentionally. The author's focus on their own feelings (being angry and sad) without considering the sister's current perspective could be the issue here. The sister might feel that her past is being highlighted in a negative way, or that her recovery is being undermined. The author's request for the sister to cover the scars could be seen as a form of judgment, even if they didn't mean it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to process their own emotions and is not in a place to tell their sister what to do. They expressed their feelings in a casual manner, not in a directive way. The problem is that the sister's reaction was strong, indicating that the topic is still sensitive. The author might need to reflect on why they feel the need to comment on the scars and find a way to support their sister without bringing up the past. However, the act of mentioning the scars in a way that caused emotional distress could make the author at fault here. They should have considered the sister's feelings more and perhaps found a different way to express their own distress without focusing on the scars themselves.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A because the author's comment, while coming from a place of concern, inadvertently hurt their sister. Even if they didn't intend to, the action of bringing up the scars in that context caused harm. They should have approached it more sensitively or found another way to express their feelings without focusing on the sister's body.\n"
