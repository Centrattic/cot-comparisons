When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and she's now recovered but has visible scars. The author feels upset and angry when seeing the scars, which affects their relationship. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Self-harm scars are personal and sensitive. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but the sister's reaction indicates that the request might be triggering or invalidating her past trauma. Even if the author's motive was to avoid their own emotional distress, the sister's feelings and autonomy are paramount. \n\nThe author acknowledges they can't fully understand the sister's perspective and admits their own selfishness. That shows self-awareness. However, by asking her to cover the scars, the author might be imposing their own emotional needs on the sister, which can be seen as disrespectful to her recovery and current comfort level. \n\nThe sister's right to her body and how she chooses to present it is crucial. The author's comment caused emotional distress, which could harm their relationship further. The key point is that the sister's well-being and autonomy should take precedence over the author's discomfort, even if the author's intentions are good. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, their approach was inappropriate. They should have found another way to cope with their own emotions without imposing on their sister. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
