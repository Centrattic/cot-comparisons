When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she has visible scars. The author, a younger sibling, feels upset and angry when seeing the scars, which affects their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's scars are a result of past trauma, and the author's reaction is causing tension. The question is whether the author is wrong for expressing their feelings in that way.\n\nSelf-harm scars are personal and sensitive. The sister might feel that her autonomy over her body is being questioned, even if the author's intention was to express concern. The author didn't tell the sister to cover them in public or make demands, but just mentioned seeing them, which led to the sister crying. \n\nThe author acknowledges they're not the right person to tell the sister what to do, which is a good sign. However, bringing up the topic in a casual way might not consider the sister's emotional state. The sister might associate the mention of scars with past trauma or feel judged. Even if the author meant to show support, the sister's reaction indicates that the conversation was hurtful. \n\nThe author's motivation is to avoid sadness and maybe protect their sister from reminders of her past, but their approach might be invalidating the sister's experience. The sister has a right to feel upset if she feels her boundaries were crossed, even if it was unintentional. The author should have considered how the sister might feel before bringing it up. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because they expressed concern in a moment of sadness. However, the way they approached it without being mindful of the sister's feelings does contribute to the problem. The sister's emotional response is valid, and the author needs to address this by apologizing and finding a better way to support her without making her feel judged.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they brought up a sensitive topic without considering how it might affect their sister, leading to hurt feelings even if their intention was to express concern.\n"
