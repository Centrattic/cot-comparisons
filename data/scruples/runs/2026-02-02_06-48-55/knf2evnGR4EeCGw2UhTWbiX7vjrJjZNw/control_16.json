When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has scars from years ago when she was bullied and self-harmed. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. They mentioned the scars casually, which upset their sister. Now, the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the sister's well-being and the author's intentions. The sister is an adult, living at home, and the scars are from past trauma. The author isn't telling her to cover up for their own benefit but because it upsets them emotionally. However, bringing it up in a casual way might have been insensitive. \n\nThe sister's reaction shows that the scars are still a sensitive topic for her. Maybe she feels that the author is judging her healing process or implying she should hide her past. The author should consider that the sister might be proud of overcoming her struggles, or maybe she's still dealing with the emotional impact. \n\nThe author isn't trying to control their sister but is struggling with their own feelings. However, the way they approached it\u2014bringing it up casually\u2014might have been the wrong approach. Instead of telling her to cover them, maybe they should have expressed their feelings without making it a demand. \n\nSo, the author's intention wasn't to harm, but the method was inappropriate. They might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and how the request could be perceived. It's possible the sister feels pressured to hide her scars, which are a part of her history. The author should focus on their own emotional response without imposing on their sister's choices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted without considering their sister's perspective and feelings, even if their intentions were from a place of concern. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid emotions.\n"
