When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has scars from past self-harm, which she's now hiding. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them sad and angry, leading them to bring it up. The sister got upset and cried. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and how their actions affected the sister. The author acknowledges their own position isn't the right to tell her what to do, showing some self-awareness. They tried to mention it casually but it had a negative impact.\n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might feel vulnerable or stigmatized if her scars are commented on. Even if the author's intent was to express discomfort, bringing it up can make the sister feel judged or reminded of her trauma. \n\nThe author's emotional reaction is valid, but the way they addressed it might not consider the sister's feelings. The sister might feel that the author is not respecting her boundaries or past experiences. The fact that it affected their relationship suggests that the approach was problematic.\n\nThe author's mistake was not considering how the sister would react. They should have focused on their own feelings without making the sister feel blamed. A better approach might be to express their sadness about the past bullying without commenting on her scars. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are real, the way they addressed the issue was inappropriate. They should be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with the necessary sensitivity and respect for their sister's boundaries.\n"
