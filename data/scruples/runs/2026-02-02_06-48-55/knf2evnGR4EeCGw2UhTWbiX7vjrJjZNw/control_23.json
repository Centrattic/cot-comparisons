When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has scars. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them feel angry and sad, and when they mentioned it, the sister got upset and cried. The author is unsure if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's scars are a result of past trauma, and she's made progress by getting therapy and stopping self-harm. The author is trying to express their feelings but might not realize how that could affect their sister. \n\nSelf-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. For someone who has experienced that, the scars might be a painful reminder of past struggles. The sister might feel judged or that her progress is being questioned if the author comments on the scars. The author's intention might be to express their emotional reaction, but the sister could perceive it as blame or a lack of understanding.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions they don't want to tell their sister what to do and acknowledge their own position of not having experienced self-harm. The problem arises in how the author brought up the issue. Instead of focusing on the sister's scars, maybe the author should have addressed their own feelings of being upset and their impact on their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are communication style and empathy. The author's approach might have been too direct without understanding the sister's perspective. The sister's emotional reaction indicates that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author's intention wasn't to criticize, but the way it was brought up could have been hurtful. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, based on the question of whether they are in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), because the author's comment upset the sister, and they didn't consider the sister's feelings adequately when bringing up the topic. The author should focus on their own emotions without placing the burden on the sister to change her behavior.\n"
