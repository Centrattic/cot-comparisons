When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's older sister who has self-harm scars from past bullying. The author is upset seeing the scars and mentioned it to her sister, causing her to cry. The question is whether the author is unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which was addressed with therapy. The author hasn't experienced this and acknowledges they can't understand the sister's perspective. The issue is the author's reaction to seeing the scars, which causes them sadness and anger, leading them to comment on it, which upset the sister.\n\nSo, the main factors here are empathy and communication. The author's intention wasn't to judge but to express their own feelings, but they may not have considered how that would affect their sister. The sister is in recovery, and visible scars might still be sensitive for her. Even though the author didn't mean to be hurtful, bringing up the scars could be triggering or make the sister feel judged, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author mentions they \"casually\" mentioned it, but the sister got upset and cried. This suggests that the sister might not be comfortable discussing the scars, or perhaps doesn't want them to be a topic of conversation. The author's emotional reaction (sadness and anger) might not be the sister's intent to cause, and the author's approach could have been more considerate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about perspective. The author is in the position of a sibling who cares but might not realize the impact of their words. The sister's reaction shows that the comment was hurtful. Even if the author's feelings are valid, the way they expressed them might have been inappropriate. The author could have handled it by discussing their own feelings without focusing on the sister's scars, perhaps seeking support for their own emotional response instead of bringing it up to the sister.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action, while coming from a place of care, might be seen as inconsiderate of the sister's current emotional state. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take into account the sister's sensitivity and the potential harm their comment could cause, despite their good intentions.\n"
