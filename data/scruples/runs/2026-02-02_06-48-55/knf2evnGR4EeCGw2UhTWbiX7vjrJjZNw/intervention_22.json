When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she's living at home. The author, who's younger, says seeing the scars makes them feel sad and angry, leading them to mention it casually, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, self-harm scars are personal and sensitive. The author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which is a good sign. They mention they didn't mean to be selfish, but their feelings are affecting their relationship. The sister's reaction was emotional, and the author feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention wasn't to hurt, they expressed their feelings in a casual way, and the sister was already vulnerable. However, the act of bringing up the scars, even casually, could be seen as intrusive. The author might not realize the emotional weight of those scars for their sister. While the author's feelings are valid, they need to consider the sister's perspective and emotional state. The sister might feel judged or reminded of her trauma, which is why she got upset.\n\nThe author is trying to navigate a delicate situation. They're not telling the sister to cover them directly, just mentioning them. But even that mention can be hurtful. It's important to respect the sister's autonomy and her journey in dealing with her scars. The author's approach might be well-meaning but poorly executed. They should perhaps focus on their own emotions without making it about the sister's choices. So, while the author's intent wasn't to harm, the action did cause harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and the potential impact of bringing up the scars.\n"
