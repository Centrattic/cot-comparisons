When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now lives at home. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them upset and angry, which affects their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't telling the sister what to do, just expressing discomfort. But the sister's reaction was emotional. The author acknowledges their own potential selfishness but is also concerned about their emotional well-being.\n\nSelf-harm is a serious issue, and the scars are a reminder of past trauma. The sister might find being told to cover them triggering or a reminder of her past. The author's intention isn't to shame but to protect their own feelings. However, the sister's emotional response suggests that the author's comment might have been hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's main issue is their own emotional reaction affecting the relationship. But by bringing up the scars, maybe they crossed a boundary. The sister might feel that the author isn't respecting her autonomy or that the author is minimizing her experience. Even if the author didn't mean to, the sister's feelings matter here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and reached out in a casual way. However, the sister's reaction indicates that the topic is sensitive. The author might need to find a way to manage their own feelings without imposing on the sister. Maybe seeking support for themselves or finding ways to cope with seeing the scars without asking the sister to cover them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to express their feelings, but the sister's well-being and autonomy are important. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of having feelings, but they might have handled the situation poorly. The sister's reaction shows that the author's comment was hurtful, so the author could be in the wrong for not considering the sister's perspective and feelings in that moment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they caused emotional distress, even if unintentionally.\n"
