When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and the author feels upset seeing them, even though they acknowledge it's selfish. They mentioned the scars casually, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister has a history of mental health issues, and the family has supported her through that. The author's intention was to address their own emotional reaction, but their approach might have been problematic. \n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction and how they communicated their feelings. The author admits they're being selfish by making it about themselves rather than the sister's well-being. However, their comment inadvertently brought up the sister's painful past, leading to her emotional distress. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to respect the person's autonomy and privacy, especially if they have a history of trauma. The author's sister might be uncomfortable discussing her scars, and bringing it up even casually could reopen old wounds. The author's well-intentioned remark was not the right way to express their feelings. \n\nThe appropriate approach would be for the author to address their own feelings without making the sister feel responsible for them. Maybe seeking support for their own emotions or discussing boundaries that are respectful. The sister's recovery is a personal journey, and the author's comment, while coming from a place of concern, was not supportive in this instance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they expressed their feelings in a way that caused harm without considering the sister's perspective and the potential impact on her. The answer should be A.\n"
