When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The sister is now doing better, but the scars are still visible. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry and sad about the bullying. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm is a serious issue, and the scars are a reminder of a traumatic experience. Hiding them might be a personal choice, but maybe the sister is comfortable showing them now. The author is feeling sad and angry, which is understandable, but bringing up the scars in a casual way might not have been the best approach. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive for her.\n\nThe author acknowledges they're not in the right position to tell her what to do, which is good. However, by commenting on the scars, they might have unintentionally triggered the sister. The key here is whether the author's action was considerate of the sister's feelings. The sister might feel that the scars are private, and the author's comment could make her feel vulnerable or judged, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nThe author's intention was to express their feelings, but the way they did it led to the sister being upset. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the sister might feel about her scars being noticed and commented on. In relationships, especially between siblings, communication is key. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by expressing their own feelings without focusing on the scars themselves. For example, talking about how the bullying affected them or their concern for their sister's well-being in a supportive way, rather than commenting on the visibility of the scars.\n\nAlso, the sister might have moved past the trauma to some extent and doesn't want to be reminded of it. The author's comment, even if well-meaning, might have brought back painful memories. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is still sensitive. The author's selfishness in feeling upset and not considering the sister's feelings in that moment could be seen as being in the wrong. However, the author is also trying to express their own emotions, which is a valid part of the dynamic.\n\nIn summary, the author likely acted without fully considering the sister's sensitivity around the scars, leading to hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because the action, even if well-intentioned, caused harm and wasn't considerate of the sister's emotional state.\n"
