When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're being unreasonable for wanting their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is four years older, had a bad experience with bullying, self-harmed in the past, and is now in therapy. The author feels upset and angry when seeing the scars, which affects their relationship. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister cried, so the author is now doubting themselves.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive issue. Even though the sister is doing better, the scars are a reminder of a traumatic time. The author is not the one who was harmed, so they can't fully understand how the sister feels about her scars. It's her body, and she might choose to show them as a way of processing her experiences or simply as they are now. The author's request for her to cover them might come off as dismissive of her past struggles or as an invasion of her personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own emotions. They feel sad and angry when they see the scars, which is understandable. They might be trying to protect themselves from those feelings, but in doing so, they might not be considering the sister's feelings. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the author's comment was hurtful, even if it was meant to be supportive.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has the right to ask their sister to cover her scars. Since the scars are a part of the sister's body and her history, she has the autonomy to decide what to do with them. The author's well-being is important, but the sister's autonomy and feelings should also be respected. The author's approach might not be the best way to handle their emotional response. Instead of asking the sister to cover up, they might need to work on their own feelings or find another way to cope without affecting their sister's choices.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are imposing their own emotional needs onto their sister without considering her autonomy and the sensitivity of the issue. The right approach would be for the author to seek support for their feelings rather than asking the sister to change her behavior.\n"
