When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. She's been in therapy and has improved, but the scars are still visible. The author is upset because seeing the scars reminds them of the bullying, making them angry and sad. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to bring up the scars. The author admits they're not in the right position to tell her what to do and acknowledge their own possible selfishness. They mentioned the scars casually, not as a command, but it caused emotional distress.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive. Even though the author's intention might have been from a place of care, bringing up the scars could have been triggering for the sister. The author is struggling with their own emotions but might not realize how their words affect the sister.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy and emotional boundaries is key. The author's actions, though well-meaning, might have crossed into the sister's personal space. The sister has the right to her own body and how she chooses to present it. The author's request (even if just a comment) might be seen as imposing their own discomfort on the sister. \n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own emotional pain and wants to protect their sister from future harm. But the way they addressed it might not be the right approach. Instead of asking her to cover them, maybe they should focus on supporting her in other ways without making her feel self-conscious about her scars. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's emotional state and the sensitivity around the topic. They should have found a way to manage their own feelings without directly addressing the scars in a way that upset her.\n"
