When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is older, had a history of bullying and self-harm, and has since gotten better with therapy. She has visible scars on her arms. The author is upset seeing these scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them sad and angry. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset. Now the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive issue. The sister might feel that her scars are a personal thing, part of her past, and she might not want to hide them. Covering them could be about protecting her privacy or how she presents herself. The author might not fully understand the trauma involved, as they haven't experienced it. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the author's comment touched on sensitive feelings, maybe making her feel judged or that her past is being criticized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their feelings. They feel sad and angry when they see the scars, which is a natural reaction. However, the problem here is that the author is projecting their feelings onto the sister. The author is aware that it's not about them, but they still brought it up. The sister's reaction shows that the author's words hurt her. The author might not have considered that bringing up the scars, even casually, could reopen wounds or make the sister feel like her recovery isn't accepted.\n\nThe author's intention wasn't to criticize but to express discomfort, but the way they did it\u2014by pointing out the scars\u2014might have been triggering. The sister's response (crying) indicates that the approach was wrong. The author should have considered alternative ways to cope with their feelings without making the sister feel responsible for covering them up. Maybe the author needs to work on their own emotional response rather than asking the sister to change her behavior.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key points are respect for the sister's autonomy and the impact of the author's words. Even if the author's feelings are valid, the sister has the right to decide how she presents her body. The author's actions crossed a boundary by making the sister feel that her past trauma is something to be hidden. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's perspective and feelings, even if their intention was to express their own.\n"
