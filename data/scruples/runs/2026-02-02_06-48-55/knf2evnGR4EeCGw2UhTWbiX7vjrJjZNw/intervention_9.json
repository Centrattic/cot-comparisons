When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which stopped after therapy. She now has visible scars. The author feels upset seeing them because it triggers anger about the bullying. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset. The author is questioning their own actions.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not in a position to tell their sister what to do, especially regarding her body and personal choices. The sister's scars are a part of her past and her healing journey. The author's motivation is emotional discomfort, which is valid, but imposing on the sister's autonomy might be the issue here.\n\nThe key points are:\n- The author's reaction is based on their own feelings, not the sister's well-being.\n- The sister is an adult (since she just left university) and has the right to choose how she presents her body.\n- The author's comment upset the sister, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nEven though the author meant well, the act of bringing up the scars might have been hurtful. The sister might feel that her past is being highlighted, which could be stigmatizing or triggering for her. The author should focus on managing their own emotions rather than asking the sister to change her behavior.\n\nSo, based on these considerations, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own feelings over respecting their sister's autonomy and boundaries.\n"
