When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation involves the sister having visible scars from past self-harm, and the author feels upset seeing them because it makes them sad and angry about the bullying. The sister got upset when the author mentioned it, and the author is now wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm is a serious issue, and scars are a reminder of past trauma. The sister might feel vulnerable or judged if someone comments on the scars, especially a family member. The author didn't know how to approach it but mentioned it casually, which might have been triggering for the sister. She got so upset she cried, which shows the emotional impact.\n\nNow, the author's intention was to express discomfort but in a way that wasn't direct or forceful. However, the sister's reaction suggests that even a casual mention can be hurtful. The author's motivation isn't to shame or judge but to avoid seeing something that upsets them. However, the key here is that the author is projecting their own feelings onto the sister. They admit it's selfish, as it's about their emotional state rather than the sister's needs.\n\nThe sister's autonomy is important. She was the one who had the traumatic experience, and it's her body. The author's request to cover the scars, even if well-meaning, could be seen as a violation of the sister's comfort with her own appearance. The sister might be in recovery, and covering the scars might not be something she wants to do anymore. The author's approach of casually bringing it up might not have been the right way, but the underlying issue is whether the request itself is valid.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they don't have experience with self-harm, so they're not in a position to dictate what's best for their sister. The sister's emotional reaction indicates that the author's comment was not just about the physical covering but about being reminded of her past in a painful way. It's possible that the author's comment made the sister feel that her pain is a burden, which is a common issue in families dealing with mental health.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own emotional comfort over their sister's potential discomfort in being reminded of her past. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is sensitive, and the author's approach might not have considered her feelings adequately. Even if the author didn't mean to, the act of bringing up the scars could be seen as insensitive, especially without knowing the sister's current feelings about them.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't malicious. They were trying to communicate their feelings but didn't realize the impact of their words. The sister's reaction is valid, but the question is whether the author was wrong in expressing their feelings. Since the author is asking for validation, the answer would hinge on whether the method of communication was appropriate. Given that the sister was upset, it's likely that the author's approach was inappropriate, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
