When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has since recovered with therapy. The author is upset seeing the scars, which triggers sadness and anger, and brought it up, causing the sister to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive issue. The sister might feel that the scars are a part of her past, and she's comfortable showing them now. The author's comment might have made her feel uncomfortable or judged, which could explain her emotional reaction. The sister might also be in a vulnerable place, having just left university and job hunting, which adds stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions. They aren't trying to invalidate their sister's experience but are overwhelmed by seeing the scars. They might be trying to protect their own mental health by asking her to cover up, which is a valid feeling, but the way they approached it was probably not the best. Mentioning the scars casually and causing her to cry suggests that the author didn't consider the emotional impact of their words. \n\nThe key here is the approach. The author should have approached the sister with empathy, perhaps in a non-confrontational way, to express their feelings without making the sister feel criticized. However, the fact that the author is trying to communicate their feelings is one aspect, but the execution might have been flawed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author's intention isn't malicious, but they might not fully understand their sister's feelings about her scars. The sister has the right to feel empowered by showing her scars if that's what she chooses, especially if she's made peace with her past. The author's request could come across as intrusive or dismissive of the sister's journey. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might have acted inconsiderately without fully understanding the sister's feelings. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for how they brought up the topic.\n"
