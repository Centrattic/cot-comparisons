When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author feels upset seeing them and mentioned it, causing the sister to cry. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's feelings. Self-harm is a serious issue, and scars can be sensitive. The author isn't in a position to dictate what the sister should do with her body. The sister might feel judged or triggered by the comment. The fact that the sister got upset and cried suggests that the author's comment was hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions, feeling sad and angry about the past bullying. They didn't mean to harm their sister but acted out of their own feelings. However, the key point is that the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, might not consider the sister's current emotional state. The sister might want to show her scars as a form of coping, or she might be working on her recovery, and covering them could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nThe author's approach was to mention the scars in a casual way, which might not be the right way to address the issue. They should have approached it with more care and sensitivity, perhaps discussing their feelings without making a direct request. The author's action affected the sister's feelings and the relationship, indicating that they might be at fault for not handling the situation better.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy and feelings in the way they addressed the issue.\n"
