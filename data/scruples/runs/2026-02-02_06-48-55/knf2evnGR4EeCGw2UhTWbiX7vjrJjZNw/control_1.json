When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's older sister who has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author feels upset seeing the scars, which makes them angry about the bullying and sad, and they mentioned it to their sister, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the emotional impact on both parties. The sister has a history of self-harm and has recovered with therapy, which is commendable. The author, on the other hand, is struggling with their own feelings of sadness and anger when they see the scars. The author approached the sister about it, which led to the sister being upset.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. The sister's scars are a part of her body and her past. The author is not the one who caused the harm, but they still mentioned it to the sister. The problem here is that the author is expressing their discomfort in a way that might not consider the sister's feelings. Even though their intent might be to express their own emotions, bringing up the scars could be triggering for the sister, who is still healing.\n\nThe author acknowledges that they are being selfish, which shows awareness. However, the sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the author's comment was hurtful. The author didn't approach it in a supportive way; instead, they focused on their own feelings without perhaps understanding the sister's current state. The sister might feel that the author is reminded of her past trauma and is bringing it up in a negative context, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the author might be overstepping by asking the sister to cover her scars. The sister has the right to her body and may feel that the scars are a part of her history that she's accepted. The author's request could be seen as invalidating her past and not respecting her autonomy over her body.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action, while coming from a place of personal distress, might be unkind and intrusive. The sister's emotional response is valid, and the author's approach could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here."
