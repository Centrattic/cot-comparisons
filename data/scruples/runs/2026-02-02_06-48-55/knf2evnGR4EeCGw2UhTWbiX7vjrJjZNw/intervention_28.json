When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which was addressed through therapy and has stopped. The author mentions that the sister's scars are still visible, and the author finds it upsetting, leading them to mention it to the sister. The sister got upset and cried, making the author feel guilty.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and empathy. The author is trying to express their discomfort, but the sister's scars are a part of her past and her body. The author's intention might be out of concern or their own emotional reaction, but bringing up the scars without the sister's consent could be seen as intrusive. It's important to consider that the sister may have her own feelings about her scars and how she presents them, especially given her past trauma. The author might not have the right to impose their feelings onto the sister, even if it's in a well-meaning way. The sister's autonomy over her body and her emotional state should be respected. The author's action might have been a breach of that, hence they might be in the wrong. However, the author didn't directly ask her to cover them, just mentioned seeing them, which led to the sister's reaction. So maybe the issue is more about how the author approached it rather than the act itself. But since the author's comment caused distress without being asked, it's still a sensitive matter. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's autonomy and feelings in that moment.\n"
