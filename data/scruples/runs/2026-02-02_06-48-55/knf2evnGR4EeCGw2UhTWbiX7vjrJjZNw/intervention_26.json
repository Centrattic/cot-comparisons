When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in a situation where they asked their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is older, has a history of bullying and self-harm, and the author says seeing the scars makes them feel sad and angry. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic because they relate to personal trauma and recovery. The author acknowledges they haven't experienced depression or self-harm and feel they can't imagine the sister's perspective. That's a good start, but maybe they didn't fully realize the impact of their comment.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's well-being and the author's approach. The sister is in recovery, so the scars might be a painful reminder for her. The author's comment, even if meant to address their own discomfort, could be perceived as invalidating her past struggles or making her feel self-conscious. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the author's words hurt her, possibly because they brought up bad memories or made her feel judged.\n\nAlso, the author says they know they're being selfish but are concerned about the effect on their relationship. They didn't approach the sister with empathy, focusing more on their own feelings than the sister's. The right approach would be to express their feelings without making the sister feel responsible for covering up her scars. Instead of asking her to cover them, maybe the author should have talked to her about their own emotional response and how they're trying to cope with it.\n\nTherapy and support for the sister are important. If the author is worried about their relationship, they might need to apologize and be more supportive. The sister might not want to be reminded of her past, so the author's comment, even if well-intentioned, was not considerate of her current state. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own feelings and didn't approach the situation with the necessary sensitivity and understanding.\n"
