When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister's self-harm scars. The author is upset seeing the scars because they make them angry about the bullying and sad about their sister's past. They mentioned it once, and now their sister is upset and crying, leading to tension between them.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they weren't trying to criticize but were overwhelmed by their emotions. They acknowledge they're not in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which is a good point. But maybe they should have considered how bringing it up would affect their sister. The sister might feel triggered or hurt by the comment, even if it was meant from a place of concern. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author had the right to mention it. Self-harm scars are personal, and the sister might prefer not to discuss them or cover them for her own reasons. The author's emotional reaction is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. Instead of commenting directly, maybe they should have addressed their own feelings separately, like talking to a therapist or a parent, without putting pressure on their sister to cover up her scars. \n\nThe sister's reaction shows that the mention was painful. The author might be unintentionally invalidating her experience by focusing on their own emotions. It's important to respect the sister's autonomy in how she deals with her scars. So, even though the author's feelings are valid, the action of bringing it up in that context might be wrong because it hurt their sister. They should have found a better way to handle their own emotions without affecting their sister negatively.\n"
