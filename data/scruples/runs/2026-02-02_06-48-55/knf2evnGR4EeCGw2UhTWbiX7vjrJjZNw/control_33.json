When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the sister having self-harm scars, and the author feels upset seeing them, which is affecting their relationship. The author mentioned the scars to their sister, who got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author is younger. The author is upset because seeing the scars makes them angry about the bullying. But they acknowledge that it's not about them, which shows some self-awareness. The problem here is whether the author's actions were appropriate.\n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intention was to address their own emotional reaction, bringing up the scars directly might not be the right approach. The sister might feel triggered or like her past is being brought up in a way that's not supportive. The fact that the sister got upset suggests that the author's comment was hurtful, even if it was meant in a different way.\n\nThe author's main issue is their own emotional reaction, but they need to consider their sister's feelings. The sister might want to keep the scars private or might not want to be reminded of her past. The author's comment could come across as a request to cover them, which the sister might perceive as judgment or a lack of understanding of her history. Even if the author didn't mean to be critical, the result is that the sister felt hurt.\n\nThe author could have approached it differently, perhaps by addressing their own feelings without directly pointing out the scars. Seeking support for themselves or finding ways to cope with the emotional impact without involving their sister might be a better approach. The key here is that the author's action, while stemming from their own pain, caused harm to their sister. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity and understanding of their sister's perspective.\n"
