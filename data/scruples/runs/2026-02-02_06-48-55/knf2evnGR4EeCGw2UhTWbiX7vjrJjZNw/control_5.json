When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they asked their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm, and the author feels upset seeing them, which affects their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is older, has been through therapy, and has come a long way. The author isn't self-harming and isn't in a position to judge. The issue is that the author's comment made the sister cry, which shows that the approach might have been hurtful.\n\nSelf-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that her scars are a private matter, and the author's comment might have unintentionally invalidated her experiences or made her feel self-conscious. The author's intention was to express their feelings, but the way they brought it up caused distress. \n\nEven though the author's motivation wasn't to criticize but to cope with their own emotions, the impact on the sister was negative. The key here is that the author might not have considered how their words would be received. The sister might have felt that her scars are a part of her past that she's worked hard to overcome, and being asked to cover them could make her feel shamed or that her struggles aren't being accepted.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges they are being selfish, which is an important point. The problem isn't the sister's scars but the author's emotional reaction to them. However, imposing their comfort on another person's body and choices is generally not acceptable. The right approach might have been to talk about their own feelings without making a direct request about the sister's appearance.\n\nSo, the author's action was likely well-meaning but misguided. They might not be in the wrong entirely because they didn't intend harm, but they did cause harm. The sister's reaction is valid, so the author needs to take responsibility and find a better way to handle their emotions without affecting the sister negatively.\n"
