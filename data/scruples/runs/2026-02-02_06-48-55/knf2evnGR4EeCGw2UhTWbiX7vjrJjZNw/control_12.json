When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author is upset seeing the scars, which triggers their sadness and anger towards the bullies. They mentioned it once, which upset the sister. Now they're worried they're being selfish and want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's autonomy and the author's intentions. The author isn't telling the sister what to do, just expressing discomfort. However, bringing up the scars might make the sister feel self-conscious again. The sister's emotional reaction (crying) shows the comment hurt her. \n\nBut the author's motivation comes from a place of caring, not wanting to see their sister suffer. However, they might not realize that the sister might prefer not to cover the scars as a reminder of her strength or that the scars are part of her healing journey. The author's well-meaning comment could have been a trigger for the sister, reopening old wounds or making her feel judged.\n\nIt's important to consider that the sister has the right to her body and how she presents herself. The author should respect her choices unless there's a risk of further harm. Since the sister has already overcome the self-harm with her family's support, the author's request might be seen as undermining her progress. \n\nThe answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and autonomy in a sensitive manner. Even though their intent was to protect or comfort, the method was inappropriate. They should have approached the situation with more empathy and perhaps focused on supporting the sister rather than making her change her appearance.\n"
