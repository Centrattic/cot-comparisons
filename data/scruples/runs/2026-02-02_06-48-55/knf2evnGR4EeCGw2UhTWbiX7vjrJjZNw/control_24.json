When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The scenario involves the sister who had a history of self-harm due to bullying. The author mentions that the scars make them sad and angry, leading to tension in their relationship. The sister reacted negatively when the author brought it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is older, has a history of self-harm, and has been through therapy. The author is younger, hasn't experienced self-harm, and feels upset seeing the scars. The key points are the author's emotional reaction and how they approached the sister.\n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might be dealing with the emotional aftermath and could have complex feelings about her scars. The author's intention was to express discomfort but didn't realize it might trigger the sister. The sister's negative reaction indicates that the way the author brought it up was hurtful.\n\nNow, considering the author's approach: they mentioned the scars casually, which the sister found upsetting. It's important to note that telling someone to cover scars can be perceived as invalidating their healing process or as a reminder of painful memories. The author might not have the right to dictate how the sister presents her body, even if the intention is to avoid their own discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges their own potential selfishness here. They admit it's not about them, but their feelings are affecting the relationship. However, respecting the sister's autonomy is crucial. The sister has the right to decide how to handle her scars, whether covering them or not. The author's comment might have been a breach of that autonomy, even if made in a casual manner.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's reaction\u2014crying and getting upset\u2014shows that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author's approach might have reopened old wounds or made her feel judged. It's possible the author didn't consider how their words could impact the sister's emotional state, focusing more on their own feelings.\n\nIn such cases, the onus is on the person expressing concern to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. The author might need to apologize, validate the sister's feelings, and perhaps discuss how to handle the situation without making her feel criticized. However, the initial action of bringing up the scars in a way that caused distress is problematic.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's perspective and feelings, approached the topic without the right to dictate her actions, and their comment may have been a trigger. The right approach would involve more empathy and understanding, respecting her autonomy, and perhaps seeking ways to support her without focusing on covering the scars.\n"
