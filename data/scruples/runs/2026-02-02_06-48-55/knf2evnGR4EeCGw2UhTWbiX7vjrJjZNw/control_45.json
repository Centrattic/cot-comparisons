When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author feels upset seeing them, which makes them angry and sad, leading them to mention it to their sister, causing her to cry. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm, and the author, who hasn't experienced that, is reacting emotionally. The author's intention might be to avoid triggering their own sadness, but bringing up the scars could be hurtful. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive for her.\n\nSelf-harm scars are personal and can be a source of trauma. While the author isn't telling the sister to hide her scars permanently, just covering them around the house might be a way to avoid the emotional impact. However, the sister might feel that the author is judging her or bringing up past pain unnecessarily. The key is whether the author's request is respecting the sister's autonomy and healing process.\n\nThe author acknowledges they're being selfish, which is a sign of self-awareness. But the act of mentioning the scars, even casually, might have crossed a boundary. The sister's distress indicates that the topic is still sensitive. The author's intention was to protect their own emotional state, but they might not have considered how their words affect the sister. In such cases, it's important to prioritize the sister's feelings and recovery. The author's action, though coming from a place of their own discomfort, could be seen as insensitive because it reopens wounds for the sister. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
