When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which stopped after therapy. The author feels upset seeing the scars and mentioned it, which made the sister cry. The author is worried about being selfish and damaging their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author and the impact on the sister. The author acknowledges their own feelings but also realizes it's not about them. However, bringing up the scars in a casual way might have been triggering for the sister. The author's intention might have been to express their feelings, but the sister's reaction shows it was hurtful. \n\nIn such situations, the person who has experienced trauma might be more sensitive. The author might not have considered the emotional weight of the scars on their sister. Even if the author's intention was to address their own discomfort, it's important to prioritize the sister's feelings and well-being. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by talking to a parent or a professional first, but the act of mentioning the scars directly might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they caused emotional distress to their sister, even if unintentionally. The wrong isn't in feeling upset themselves, but in how they addressed it with their sister.\n"
