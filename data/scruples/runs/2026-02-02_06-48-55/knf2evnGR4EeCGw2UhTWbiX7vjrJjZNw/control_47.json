When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister has scars from when she was bullied and self-harmed, and she's been in therapy and has recovered a lot. The author says they don't want to tell her what to do but find it upsetting to see the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they're not trying to hurt their sister but are feeling emotional about the situation. They acknowledge their sister's progress, which is important. However, the sister's autonomy is a key factor here. The scars are part of her past, and while the author is upset, the sister might see the scars as part of her healing journey. The author's comment might have come from a place of concern but could have been perceived as judgment or criticism, especially since the sister was already vulnerable.\n\nThe sister's reaction was crying and getting upset, which shows that the comment hurt her feelings. Even if the author meant it without malice, the impact is what matters. The author should consider that their sister might be sensitive about the scars, regardless of her progress. The fact that the author mentioned it casually might not have been the best approach. Instead of asking her to cover them, maybe expressing their feelings in a more supportive way would have been better, like acknowledging their sister's strength without making her feel self-conscious.\n\nAlso, the author admits they're being selfish because it's not about them. That's a valid point. The sister has the right to be comfortable in her own home, and the author's feelings shouldn't dictate her choices. The key issue here is respect for the sister's autonomy versus the author's emotional response. Since the author's actions caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally, it's likely they're in the wrong. They need to apologize and find a way to support their sister without projecting their own feelings onto her.\n"
