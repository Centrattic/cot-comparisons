When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and the author is upset seeing them, leading to tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is struggling because the scars remind them of the sister's past and make them sad and angry. They mentioned it casually, which upset the sister. The sister might feel that the author is judging her or bringing up a sensitive topic without considering her feelings.\n\nThe author acknowledges they're being selfish but don't know how to fix it. They want to know if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate that.\n\nSelf-harm scars can be a very sensitive issue. The sister has already gone through a lot, and the author bringing it up, even casually, might have triggered her. The sister's reaction (crying) shows that the topic is still painful for her. The author's intention might be to express concern, but the way they approached it was inappropriate. It's important to respect the sister's autonomy and privacy. The author should have focused on their own emotional response without making the sister feel judged or responsible for their feelings.\n\nIn these situations, the right approach is often to address one's own emotions rather than directly commenting on the other person's body or past. The author could seek support for themselves or communicate their feelings without placing the sister in a position where she feels criticized. Therefore, the author's action was unkind and considerate, making them the asshole here.\n"
