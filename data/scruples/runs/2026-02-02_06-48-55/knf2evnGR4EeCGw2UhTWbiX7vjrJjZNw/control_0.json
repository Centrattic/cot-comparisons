When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has scars from self-harm due to bullying. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the past bullying and sad. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset and cried. Now the author feels bad and is wondering if they're unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister's scars are a result of past trauma. The author is close to the sister but feels emotionally affected by seeing them. The sister is now doing better, but the scars are still there. The author's comment caused emotional distress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a psychological standpoint, self-harm scars are personal and sensitive. The sister might feel that her privacy and boundaries were crossed. The author's reaction, while coming from a place of care, might not consider the sister's current feelings about her scars. Even if the author's intention was to express concern, bringing up the scars could be triggering for the sister, especially if she's worked hard to recover.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions they didn't directly ask her to cover them but just pointed out that they could see the scars. The sister's emotional response suggests that the topic is still a sensitive one for her. The author's own feelings (sadness, anger) are valid, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. It's important to respect the sister's autonomy over her body and how she chooses to present herself.\n\nIn terms of advice, the author might need to focus on their own emotional processing without imposing on the sister. Maybe seeking support for their own feelings rather than asking the sister to change her behavior. The sister's recovery is a process, and her displaying scars might be part of her healing or acceptance. The author's comment, even if well-meaning, could unintentionally invalidate the sister's progress or make her feel like her scars are a burden.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). They might have overstepped by bringing up the scars, even if indirectly, without considering the sister's current emotional state and boundaries. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is still sensitive, and the author's actions, while perhaps from a place of concern, caused harm in this context.\n"
