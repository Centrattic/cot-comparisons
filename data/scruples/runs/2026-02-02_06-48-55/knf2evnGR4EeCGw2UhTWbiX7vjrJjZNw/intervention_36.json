When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their sister to cover self-harm scars, which led to the sister getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm and has made progress, but the scars are still visible. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying their sister endured. The author mentioned the scars casually, and the sister was hurt by that.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the sister's reaction. The author acknowledges that the scars aren't their problem and that they're being selfish. They also mention that their sister is doing better, so bringing up the scars might reopen old wounds. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful, even if the author didn't mean to be harsh.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but they didn't approach it in a way that prioritized their sister's feelings. They didn't ask how she felt about the scars or if she was comfortable discussing it. Instead, they made a comment that triggered a negative reaction. In situations involving someone's mental health and past trauma, it's important to approach topics with sensitivity and to consider the person's current emotional state.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to express their feelings, but the way they did it was inappropriate. The key issue is that they didn't take the right approach. They should have had a more supportive conversation, perhaps asking how their sister feels about the scars and offering support, rather than making a casual comment that upset her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were well-meaning but poorly executed. They didn't consider the emotional impact of their words on their sister, leading to the sister's upset reaction. Therefore, the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong because their approach was not considerate of their sister's feelings and triggered a negative response.\n"
