When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's older sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author mentions that the sister is doing better but still has visible scars. The author is upset seeing them because it makes them angry about the bullying. They tried to mention it once, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're not in the best position to be telling their sister what to do, especially since they haven't experienced self-harm themselves. They're feeling guilty for bringing up the scars because it caused emotional pain to their sister. They admit it's selfish and not about them, but they're struggling with their emotions.\n\nNow, the sister's side: she's had a traumatic experience with bullying and self-harm. She's been through therapy and is recovering, but the scars are a reminder of that pain. When someone brings up the scars, it can trigger her emotions again, making her cry. She might feel that her privacy is invaded or that her past is being highlighted.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and boundaries. The author is trying to express their discomfort, but they might not realize how their words can affect their sister. Even though their intention is to show concern, the way they approached it made their sister upset. The sister might need space or not want to be reminded of her past, even if the scars are visible. It's possible that the author didn't consider how bringing up the scars, even casually, could reopen emotional wounds.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges they are being selfish by saying it's not about them. That self-awareness is important. They should focus on managing their own feelings without imposing on their sister. Maybe suggesting alternatives, like the sister covering the scars if she's uncomfortable, but respecting her autonomy. However, the sister's right to feel comfortable in her own home and with her family might be more important than the author's discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they expressed their feelings in a way that hurt their sister, even if unintentionally. They should work on coping with their own emotions rather than asking their sister to cover up her scars, which could be a personal choice she's made for herself.\n"
