When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author's sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and the author feels upset seeing them, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't in a position to tell their sister what to do, as they've never experienced self-harm. The sister is now doing better, and the author's intention might be concern, but the approach might be wrong. \n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might associate them with painful memories, and being asked to cover them could feel like a judgment or a reminder of her past. The author mentioned it casually, but it upset their sister, causing her to cry. That reaction suggests the comment was hurtful.\n\nThe author's motivation here is important. They're upset because they feel anger towards the bullies, but their sister's scars are part of her history. The author's feelings of sadness and anger are valid, but how they expressed it may not have been the right approach. \n\nIt's about respect for autonomy. The sister has the right to decide how she presents herself, especially in her own home. The author's request, even if well-meaning, might infringe on that. The key here is whether the author overstepped their bounds. Since the sister was in a vulnerable position before and the author's words caused pain, the author is likely at fault here.\n\nAlso, the sister's emotional response indicates that the scars are still sensitive for her. The author should have found a different way to express their feelings without making the sister feel bad about her scars. They might need to apologize and find a way to support their sister without bringing up the scars.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their sister's feelings and the potential impact of their words. They should focus on supporting her rather than trying to change her appearance.\n"
