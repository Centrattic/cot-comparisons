When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister has scars from when she was bullied and self-harmed, and now the author is upset seeing them, which makes them feel sad and angry. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to be careful not to impose their will, which is good. They acknowledge they're not in the right position to tell her what to do. The sister's scars are part of her history, and she's come a long way. The author's intention might be to protect their own emotional well-being, but they have to consider their sister's feelings and autonomy.\n\nSelf-harm scars can be sensitive. For someone who has experienced that trauma, being told to cover the scars might feel like being asked to hide their past or their pain. The sister might feel that her scars are a part of her story, and covering them could be a reminder of the trauma or a way of reclaiming her body. The author's comment made the sister cry, which indicates that the request was hurtful.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't want to be selfish, but their reaction is affecting the relationship. It's important to recognize that while the author's feelings are valid, they need to respect their sister's boundaries and choices. The sister's autonomy in deciding how to present her body is key here. The author should focus on managing their own emotions without imposing their preferences on their sister. They might need to seek support for their own feelings, like talking to a therapist, instead of making requests that could cause distress.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a request that hurt their sister, even if their intention was to cope with their own emotions. The sister's right to choose how to handle her scars takes precedence.\n"
