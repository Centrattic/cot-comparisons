When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a sibling who's upset about seeing their older sister's self-harm scars. The sister has come a long way since her teenage years, but the scars are still visible. The author mentions that they feel angry and sad when they see the scars, which is affecting their relationship. They tried to mention it casually, but the sister got upset and cried. The author is now feeling guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author is struggling with the emotional impact of seeing those scars. The author acknowledges that they aren't in the right position to tell their sister what to do and that this is about their own feelings, not the sister's actions. However, the sister now feels upset because of the mention, which caused a rift.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, self-harm scars can be sensitive for the person who has them. Even if the scars are old, seeing them might trigger emotions for the person with the scars or for others around them. The author's intention was probably to express their feelings without being judgmental, but the sister's reaction suggests that the mention was hurtful. The key here is that the author's action, though coming from a place of sadness and anger, might have been a breach of the sister's personal boundaries without considering her current emotional state or how she feels about her scars.\n\nThe author admits to being selfish in their reasoning because it's not about the sister but their own feelings. However, the sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she's made progress in overcoming her past. The act of bringing up the scars could make her feel as though her recovery is being judged or that her past is being highlighted in a negative way. The sister's emotional response (crying) indicates that the conversation was painful for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own emotional struggle and wants to know if they're in the wrong. They did approach it casually, which might not have been the best method. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is sensitive, so the author's attempt to address their feelings might have been misjudged in terms of timing or approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention isn't malicious, but the action might have been insensitive. The sister's well-being and comfort are important, and the author's words, even if well-meaning, could be seen as intrusive. The author should have considered whether the sister is comfortable discussing her scars or if the mention would trigger her. Since the sister was upset, it's possible the author overstepped, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the answer here would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they brought up a sensitive topic without considering the sister's current feelings about her scars, leading to emotional distress. However, there's nuance because the author's feelings are valid, but the way they addressed it may have been inappropriate.\n"
