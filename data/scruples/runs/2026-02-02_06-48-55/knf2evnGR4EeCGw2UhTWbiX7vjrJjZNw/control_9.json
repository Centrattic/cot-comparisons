When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars from past bullying, and the author is upset by seeing them. The author mentioned the scars casually, which upset the sister and caused a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of self-harm, which stopped after therapy. The author is not someone with personal experience of self-harm, so they acknowledge they don't know the sister's perspective. The author's main issue is that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad, and they brought it up, leading to the sister crying and them feeling guilty.\n\nNow, why might the author be in the wrong? They might have overstepped by bringing up the scars. The sister might feel that the author shouldn't impose their feelings on her, especially given the sensitive nature of self-harm. The author's comment could be seen as invasive or lacking in empathy. Even if the author meant it casually, the topic is likely triggering for the sister. The author's own emotional reaction (anger, sadness) isn't the sister's responsibility to manage, so their approach might be inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't telling the sister to cover up, just asking her to cover the scars. They did mention it casually, not in a confrontational way. The author is struggling with their feelings and wants to understand if they're being unreasonable. They also feel bad after the sister's reaction, showing remorse. However, the sister's scars are a part of her history, and covering them might not be something she's comfortable with. The author's approach could be too direct, not considering the sister's boundaries.\n\nIn terms of boundaries and respect, the sister's autonomy is important. The author's comment might have breached that by making the sister feel she needs to hide her scars. The sister's emotional response indicates that the topic is still sensitive. The author's own feelings, while valid, shouldn't override the sister's needs and comfort. The fact that the sister is doing well in therapy and has overcome a lot suggests that the scars are part of her past, and she might be in a place where she doesn't want to hide them anymore. The author's intervention, even if well-intentioned, might not be helpful and could be harmful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action of bringing up the scars, even if casually, likely crossed a boundary. The sister's reaction shows that it's a sensitive issue, and the author's focus on their own emotional reaction doesn't justify making the sister feel she needs to cover up her history. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and boundaries in this situation.\n"
