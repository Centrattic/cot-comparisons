When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. So the situation is that the sister has noticeable scars from when she was bullied, leading to self-harm. The author is upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them sad and angry. They mentioned it once, the sister got upset and cried, and now they feel bad and are wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't the one who was bullied or self-harmed, so they don't have firsthand experience. They mention they're not in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which shows some awareness. But they feel their emotions are affecting their relationship. The sister's feelings are clearly hurt when the author brought it up, so maybe the way it was communicated was an issue.\n\nSelf-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. Even if the intention is to show concern, bringing it up without the right approach might be perceived as intrusive or judgmental. The sister might feel that the author is invalidating her past struggles or not respecting her privacy. The author's reaction of feeling sad and angry might not be what the sister needs to hear, especially if she's already healed and moving on.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to express their feelings, not to criticize. They did it casually, but maybe the context wasn't right. The key here is whether the author had the right to express their feelings in that manner. It's possible that while the intention isn't malicious, the subject itself is sensitive and personal. The sister might have boundaries around her scars, seeing them as part of her history that she's worked through, and the author's mention could reopen emotional wounds.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own emotional response and doesn't want to feel that way. But in relationships, it's important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries. The sister might not want to be reminded of her past, or she might prefer to keep her arms bare as a form of self-acceptance or healing. The author's approach might not have been as supportive as possible.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author tried to express their feelings but it led to hurt. The sister's reaction indicates that the author overstepped, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their sister's feelings and boundaries when bringing up the topic. The right approach would be to seek support for themselves rather than expecting their sister to change her behavior. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
