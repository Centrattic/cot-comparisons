When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from when she was bullied and self-harmed, and the author feels upset seeing them, even though they know it's not about them. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset. Now the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which stopped after therapy. The author is not in the same situation, so they admit they can't fully understand. The key points here are intent and impact. The author's intention was to express discomfort, maybe out of concern or their own emotional reaction. However, bringing up the scars directly, even casually, might have been triggering for the sister. \n\nSelf-harm scars are sensitive. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the act of pointing them out could be seen as invalidating the sister's experience or making her feel self-conscious. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that it was hurtful. The author might be projecting their feelings onto the sister, not considering how the sister might feel about her own scars. The author says it's affecting their relationship now, which implies that the sister is now more guarded or upset around the author.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're being selfish. They admit it's not about them, but their emotional reaction is causing tension. The sister's autonomy is important here. The sister has the right to decide how she presents her body. The author's request might come off as controlling or dismissive of the sister's healing process. Even if well-meaning, the approach might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, the key factors are: the author's intent, the sister's emotional response, the sister's autonomy, and the potential for the author's actions to cause further distress. Even if the author's intention was to express concern, the method of addressing it directly might not have been the right approach. The sister's boundaries and feelings are paramount here. Therefore, the author may be in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries and for causing additional emotional harm.\n"
