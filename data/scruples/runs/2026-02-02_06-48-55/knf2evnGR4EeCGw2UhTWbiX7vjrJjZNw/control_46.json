When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now lives at home. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying their sister endured. They mentioned it once, which upset the sister. Now the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been through a lot, and the author is close to her but not experiencing the same trauma. The author's motivation is their emotional response, which is valid in that they care. However, the sister might feel that the author's comment was intrusive or invalidating. Self-harm scars can be a sensitive topic; the sister might be trying to move past that part of her life and doesn't want to be reminded of it or judged for her past actions.\n\nThe key points are: the author's action was to mention the scars, which caused distress. The sister's reaction suggests that the mention was hurtful. The author acknowledges their possible selfishness, which shows self-awareness. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the sister's body and how she chooses to present it is her own decision. The author, even with good intentions, might not have the right to ask her to cover them. The sister might feel that the author is not respecting her autonomy or is making the situation about the author's feelings rather than the sister's healing process. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention wasn't to criticize but to express discomfort from seeing the scars, which stems from empathy and anger towards the past bullying. However, the way it was communicated might not have been supportive. The sister might need support, not a reminder of her past. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy in how she handles her scars. Even with good intentions, the sister's feelings and boundaries are more important. The author should have found another way to cope with their emotions without making a request that affects the sister's comfort. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
