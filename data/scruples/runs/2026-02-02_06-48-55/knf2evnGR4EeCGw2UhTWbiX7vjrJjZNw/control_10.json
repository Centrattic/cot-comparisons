When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is four years older, just left university, and is living at home looking for a job. She was bullied at 17, which led to self-harm, and then got therapy and stopped. The scars are still visible. The author says they've never been depressed or self-harmed, so they don't think they have the right to tell her what to do. However, seeing the scars makes the author very upset and angry about the bullying. They mentioned the scars once, the sister got upset and cried, and now the author feels terrible and is worried about their relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's emotional reaction versus the sister's current state. The author is feeling sad and angry when they see the scars, which they associate with the bullying. The sister, on the other hand, has overcome self-harm and is now in a better place. The author mentioned the scars in passing, which upset the sister.\n\nNow, considering the sister's history, the scars are part of her past trauma. She might be sensitive about them, especially since she's still processing her experiences. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but they didn't frame it as a request for the sister to cover them. However, the sister's reaction suggests that even the mention of the scars triggered her emotionally. \n\nThe author is concerned about being selfish, acknowledging that it's not about them. But they also are struggling with their own emotions, which is valid. However, the act of bringing up the scars might have been insensitive, even if it wasn't a direct request for her to cover them. The sister might feel that the author is bringing up a painful part of her past without considering how it affects her now. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister got upset and started crying. This indicates that the conversation was hurtful, even if the author's intention wasn't to cause harm. The sister might feel that her scars are a private matter, and the author's mention of them, even casually, invaded her privacy or reopened old wounds. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking the sister to hide her body; they're just expressing their discomfort. But the way it was brought up might not have been the right approach. The author should have considered the sister's feelings and perhaps found a better way to address their own emotions without making the sister feel judged or uncomfortable.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the sister has the right to decide how she wants her body to be perceived. The author's request, even if well-meaning, might be seen as a boundary issue. It's important to respect others' autonomy, especially regarding their own bodies and past trauma. The author might need to find ways to manage their own emotional response without imposing on the sister's choices.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions might be considered as being in the wrong because they expressed their discomfort in a way that hurt their sister. They may not have considered the emotional impact on the sister, given her history. The correct answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted without considering the sister's feelings and triggered a negative reaction.\n"
