When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the family was aware. The author mentions that they're upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. The sister got upset when the author casually mentioned the scars, leading to tension.\n\nThe author acknowledges they're not in the right to tell the sister what to do and feels selfish. The key here is intent. The author's intention wasn't to judge but to avoid sadness. However, bringing up the scars directly could be triggering for the sister. The author didn't ask her to cover them explicitly, just mentioned seeing them, which led to her emotional response. \n\nThe sister's well-being is primary here. The author's actions, even if well-meaning, might have been intrusive. The rightness or wrongness depends on whether the author overstepped. Since the author didn't force the issue but the sister was hurt, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting boundaries. Alternatively, if the author was trying to express concern, maybe not. But the sister's reaction shows the impact was negative. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have approached it differently or not at all, respecting the sister's autonomy and emotional state.\n"
