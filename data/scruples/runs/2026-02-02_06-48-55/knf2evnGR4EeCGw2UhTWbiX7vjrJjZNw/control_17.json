When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the sister) is in the wrong for asking her sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the older sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The younger sister sees them and it makes her upset because it reminds her of the bullying. She mentioned the scars once, which upset the older sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The older sister has a history of self-harm and has overcome it with therapy. The younger sister is trying to express her feelings but might not realize the impact of her words. The key points are intent and the effect. The younger sister's intention was to express her discomfort, but it came out as a request that made the older sister feel upset. \n\nThe question is whether the younger sister is in the wrong. The older sister has the right to have her feelings respected. The younger sister might not have realized how sensitive the topic is. However, the issue here is that the younger sister's comment was a direct mention of the scars, which triggered an emotional response. \n\nBut the younger sister isn't asking the older sister to hide her scars out of judgment; she's expressing her own emotional struggle. However, she should have approached it more carefully, perhaps focusing on her own feelings without making the older sister feel like covering up is necessary. The problem is that the younger sister's approach might have invalidated the older sister's experience. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the older sister has autonomy over her body and how she chooses to present herself. The younger sister's request, even if well-meaning, might be seen as imposing her own comfort on the older sister's autonomy. However, the younger sister is also in a tough spot because she's dealing with her own emotional reaction. \n\nThe key here is whether the younger sister is in the wrong. If the request was made in a way that respects the older sister's autonomy but seeks to address her own emotional needs, maybe not. But the way she mentioned the scars directly led to the older sister crying, which suggests that the approach was not respectful. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she made a direct comment about the scars, which upset her sister, even if she didn't mean to be judgmental. Alternatively, B (No) could be the case if the sister was trying to communicate her feelings and didn't mean to hurt. However, the act of pointing out the scars in a way that caused distress, even if casual, might make the younger sister responsible for not handling the conversation with more care and sensitivity. So, A is more likely correct here.\n"
