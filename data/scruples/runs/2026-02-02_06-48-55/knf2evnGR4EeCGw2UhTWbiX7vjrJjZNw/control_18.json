When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe sister is four years older, recently left university, and is at home looking for a job. She had a history of self-harm due to bullying when she was 17. The parents took her to therapy, and it stopped. Now she has noticeable scars on her arms. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them feel sad and angry because they can't believe someone was bullied so badly. They tried to casually mention it once, which upset their sister, leading to crying and tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not the one who was harmed; they're a sibling who is affected by seeing the scars. They acknowledge they can't imagine the sister's perspective and that they're being selfish. But they're struggling with their own emotions. The key point is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the scars.\n\nSelf-harm scars are sensitive. The sister might have worked hard to recover, and being reminded of her past could be painful. The author's intention might have been to express concern or maybe even to help, but the approach was not well-received. The sister got upset, indicating that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author's actions, while coming from a place of emotion, might have been hurtful. \n\nThe author is aware of their own position not being in the right, but they're trying to understand if their feelings are valid. However, the sister's feelings about her scars and privacy are probably more important. The sister has the right to her body and how she chooses to present herself, even at home. The author's reaction is causing distress, so maybe they should focus on their own coping mechanisms rather than asking the sister to cover up. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they brought up a sensitive issue without considering the sister's feelings. Even though they meant well, the sister's emotional response shows that it was a mistake. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister about their own feelings in a supportive way, not to ask her to cover the scars. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they tried to address the scars in a way that upset their sister, without fully respecting her boundaries or the emotional impact it might have. The focus should be on the sister's right to her body and the author needing to find their own way to cope with their feelings rather than imposing on the sister.\n"
