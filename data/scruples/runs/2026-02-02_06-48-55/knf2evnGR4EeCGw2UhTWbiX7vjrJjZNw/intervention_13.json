When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied as a teenager. The sister has since recovered with therapy, but the scars are still visible. The author is upset that their sister leaves her arms bare at home, which makes them feel sad and angry. When the author casually mentioned the scars, the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't telling the sister to cover the scars in public, just at home. But the sister is in her own home, so she might feel comfortable being bare-armed. The author is affected emotionally by seeing the scars, which is understandable, but they admit they're not in the right place to tell the sister what to do. The sister's scars are a part of her past and her healing journey. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their feelings versus the sister's autonomy. The author's comment upset the sister, which suggests that even if the intention was to express concern, it was hurtful. The sister might feel that her scars are a private matter, and the author bringing it up, even casually, breached that privacy. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges they're being selfish by saying it's not about them. The sister's well-being and comfort in her own home should probably take precedence. The fact that the author's sister is in recovery and has come a long way means that the scars are part of her history. The author's emotional reaction is valid, but how they expressed it may have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for bringing up the issue without considering the sister's feelings and boundaries. The right approach would have been to handle their emotions privately, perhaps seeking support elsewhere instead of commenting on the sister's appearance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
