When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and the author is upset seeing them. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset. Now the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive issue. The sister has worked through her trauma with therapy and has come a long way. She might feel that her scars are a private part of her past, and someone mentioning them can reopen old wounds or make her feel vulnerable. The author's sister might be uncomfortable with being reminded of that painful time, especially if she's already made progress in overcoming it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their feelings about seeing the scars. They admit they might be selfish and that it's not about them. However, their emotional reaction is real\u2014they feel sad and angry. But the key here is that the author's feelings need to be balanced against the sister's autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nWhen the author mentioned the scars, it upset the sister, leading to tears. That suggests that the topic is still sensitive for the sister. The author might not have considered how bringing up the scars could affect her emotionally. Even if the author's intention was to express their feelings, the sister might perceive it as judgment or a lack of understanding.\n\nThe author's approach was to casually mention seeing the scars, which might not be the best way to address such a delicate topic. Instead of just bringing it up, maybe the author should have had a more thoughtful conversation about their feelings, ensuring they validate the sister's experience and ask how she feels about her scars. But in this case, the author didn't do that\u2014they just brought it up and then the sister reacted negatively.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that they're not in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which is correct. It's not their place to dictate how their sister should present herself, especially regarding her body and past trauma. The sister's choice to leave her arms bare is her personal decision, and the author's request for her to cover them could be seen as imposing their own discomfort onto her.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's current state. She's coming out of university, looking for a job, and might be in a vulnerable time. The author's comment could have made her feel that her past is being judged, which could be stressful. The sister might feel like her progress is being undermined or that her family isn't fully supportive anymore.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action of mentioning the scars in a casual way without considering the sister's feelings likely caused harm. The sister's emotional response indicates that the topic is still sensitive. The author's feelings are valid, but they have to respect the sister's autonomy and emotional boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here because their approach was not considerate enough of the sister's perspective and feelings.\n"
