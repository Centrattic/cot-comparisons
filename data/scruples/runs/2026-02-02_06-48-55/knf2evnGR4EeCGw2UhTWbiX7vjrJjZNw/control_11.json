When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which is now in the past. The author feels upset and angry seeing the scars, which is affecting their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the sister's reaction. The author didn't tell their sister to cover up for their own comfort but expressed their feelings. However, bringing up the scars might have been triggered by the author's own emotions rather than the sister's current needs. The sister's emotional response suggests that the topic is still sensitive for her. \n\nThe author acknowledges their possible selfishness and immediately felt bad after the sister cried. This shows they care about their sister's feelings. But the act of mentioning the scars, even casually, might have been hurtful. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and while the author is proud of her recovery, focusing on the scars might inadvertently bring up painful memories.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't force the sister to cover up, just asked. The sister has the autonomy to decide how she presents herself. However, the way the author approached it might have been insensitive without considering the sister's emotional state. The author's intention was to express their feelings, but it's important to respect the sister's boundaries and how she handles her past.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they brought up a sensitive topic that affected their sister negatively, even if their intention was to express their own emotions. The sister's reaction indicates that the approach was not appropriate.\n"
