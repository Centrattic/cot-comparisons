When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and the author, who's younger, feels upset seeing them. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The sister is four years older and has been through a lot. The author mentions they've never experienced depression or self-harm, so they might not fully understand the sister's perspective. The author's intention was to ask the sister to cover the scars, but doing so made the sister cry. That's a strong reaction.\n\nThe key points here might be about boundaries and empathy. The author is trying to express their feelings, but maybe didn't realize how sensitive the topic is. The sister might feel that the author is judging her or bringing up past trauma unnecessarily. Even though the author's intention was to avoid feeling sad, the sister might feel invalidated or reminded of her pain.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges they might be being selfish. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and she might have worked hard to recover. The author's comment could have triggered her, especially if she's still healing. Even if the author meant to be supportive, bringing up the scars without the sister being comfortable could be seen as invasive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own emotions and wants to protect their mental state. They might feel that seeing the scars makes them sad because of the bullying their sister endured. But the sister has the right to decide what she's comfortable with regarding her body and privacy.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author overstepped by bringing it up. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the author did. The author might not have considered that the sister might not want to discuss or hide her scars, and that the act of mentioning it was hurtful, regardless of the author's intention. So the author probably is in the wrong here because they didn't respect the sister's boundaries and possibly reopened old wounds.\n"
