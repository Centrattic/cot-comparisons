When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. Let me start by going through the details provided.\n\nThe sister is four years older, has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and has been in therapy. The author mentions that even though they're proud of their sister's progress, seeing the scars makes them upset and angry about the bullying. They tried to mention it casually, which upset the sister, leading to crying. The author feels bad now and is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that her scars are part of her healing journey or that covering them is an unnecessary step if she's already made progress. Publicly hiding scars is often a personal choice, and the sister might not want to be reminded of her past, especially by a family member. The author, while not having experienced self-harm, is projecting their own emotional reaction onto the situation, which could be seen as invalidating the sister's autonomy.\n\nThe author's intention might be to protect their own emotional state, but they're not the ones who have to live with the scars. By bringing up the scars, even casually, the author might have unintentionally triggered the sister, who could feel judged or not supported. The sister's reaction of crying indicates that the comment was hurtful. The author's approach was not to confront the sister about the self-harm but to ask her to cover the scars to avoid their own discomfort, which could be seen as selfish because it's about the author's feelings rather than the sister's well-being.\n\nHowever, the author did express concern in a casual way, not as a demand. But the sister's reaction suggests that even casual mention of the scars is difficult for her. The key issue here is the balance between the author's emotional needs and the sister's right to self-expression and autonomy. Since the author's well-being is affected by seeing the scars, but the sister's scars are a part of her history that she might feel she can handle, the author's request might be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider that their sister's comfort and agency are more important. The author's way of addressing it caused emotional distress, so even if their intentions were good, the execution was flawed. They might need to focus on managing their own emotions rather than asking the sister to alter her behavior. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they prioritized their own feelings without considering the impact on their sister's emotional state and autonomy.\n"
