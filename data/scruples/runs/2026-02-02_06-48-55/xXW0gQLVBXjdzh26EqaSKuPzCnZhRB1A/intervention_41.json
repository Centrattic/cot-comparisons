He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review during an exit interview. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a graphic designer working under a boss who's described as a terrible manager. The boss is portrayed as racist, hypocritical, and abusive. The author has a lot of grievances, including racism, inappropriate comments, and poor management. They're considering taking this to HR when they leave but are conflicted because they think the boss might be a good person otherwise.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are the boss's behavior. The author lists specific instances of racism and inappropriate conduct. In many workplaces, especially in countries with strong anti-discrimination laws, racism is a serious issue. If the author has documented these incidents with dates and locations, that's a strong case. \n\nHowever, exit interviews are typically for the employee's feedback about their experience, not necessarily for reporting misconduct. HR should be the proper channel for such issues, not just an exit interview. The author is concerned about whether they should report it when leaving. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nIf the boss's behavior includes illegal activities like racism, then it's a legal matter. The author has a responsibility to report such things if they were aware and had the means to do so. But maybe the author is conflicted because they think the boss is a \"good person,\" perhaps in personal terms, which might not excuse professional misconduct.\n\nBut in terms of ethics, allowing racism to go unreported could be seen as complicity. However, the author is considering reporting it after leaving. Is there a duty to report even after leaving? It depends on the company's policies and the legal framework. In some places, employees can report past incidents even after leaving.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is thinking about reporting, maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, if they choose not to report despite knowing the boss's racism, they might be complicit. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting, which seems justified given the severity of the issues.\n\nWait, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving a scathing review. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author reports the boss's misconduct, especially if it's illegal, then they're not in the wrong. However, if they're just giving a harsh review in the exit interview without going through proper channels, maybe that's unprofessional. But the user mentioned a catalogued list with dates, which suggests they are serious about reporting to HR, not just venting.\n\nSo, the key is whether reporting to HR is appropriate. Since the author has documented the issues, reporting is the right thing to do. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The user's own opinion is that the author is wrong, but based on the information, the author is justified in reporting serious misconduct. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
