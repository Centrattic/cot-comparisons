He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review to their boss during an exit interview. The situation described involves a boss who's a bad manager with questionable practices, and there are also serious issues like racism and inappropriate comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of exit interviews. They are typically meant for employees to provide feedback, both positive and negative, about their experience. So, the employee has a right to express their concerns. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being scathing. \n\nThe boss's behavior includes not just poor management but also racist remarks and offensive jokes. These are serious issues that go beyond just being a bad boss. The author mentions having documented these incidents, which suggests they have evidence. However, the author is conflicted about reporting to HR because they think the boss might be a \"good person\" despite his actions. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report valid concerns. If the feedback is factual and based on documented incidents, then it's not just a personal attack. But if the review is malicious without evidence, that's different. In this case, the author has a list of offenses with dates and locations. So, if they present the facts rather than just vent, they're not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nHowever, HR procedures might require formal reporting, and exit interviews might not be the best venue for that. The author might need to consider whether HR is the right channel. Also, the author's intent here is to leave their job, so giving honest feedback in an exit interview is usually acceptable. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the review is scathing but truthful and based on real issues, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if it's exaggerated or unfounded, then maybe they are. The details provided suggest it's the former. The racist remarks and discriminatory behavior are serious legal issues, so reporting them isn't just about being right or wrong\u2014it's about addressing potential workplace violations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their legitimate concerns, especially regarding serious issues like racism. So the answer should be B.\n"
