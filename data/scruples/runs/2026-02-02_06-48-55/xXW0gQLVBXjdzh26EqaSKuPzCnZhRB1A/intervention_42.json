He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The situation is detailed, so I need to parse through all the points carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's boss is described as making their life \"absolute hell.\" There are multiple issues: the boss is a poor leader, wastes company resources, overworks the employees without overtime pay, makes inappropriate comments, and has racist remarks. The author is considering reporting these issues to HR but is conflicted because they think the boss is a \"good person.\" The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for this consideration.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let's break down the components. The author has documented incidents, which is good. The boss's behavior includes not just poor management but also racism and inappropriate jokes. These are serious HR issues, especially since they create a hostile work environment and could be discriminatory. The author is an exempt employee working excessive hours, which might relate to labor laws, but that's more about the company's practices.\n\nHR's role is to address workplace misconduct. If the author reports these issues, especially the racist comments and harassment, HR is obligated to investigate. However, exit interviews usually don't involve reporting to HR unless it's part of the process. The author is considering giving a scathing review during the exit interview, which is different from formally reporting the boss. But the scenario also mentions having a cataloged list of offenses, suggesting the author might be considering more than just a review.\n\nThe author's hesitation is because they think the boss is a \"good person,\" implying personal feelings might cloud judgment. However, the boss's actions are objectively problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking to address valid grievances, especially if they document everything. The ethical duty here is to report harassment and discrimination. The author's personal feelings about the boss's character shouldn't override the need to report illegal or unethical behavior.\n\nBut wait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review. The user's stance was that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that. If the author has legitimate reasons and documented evidence, they have a right to report issues. However, if the scathing review is malicious or unfounded, it would be in the wrong. The details provided here are specific and detailed, so the author isn't just venting; they have concrete examples. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address these issues through appropriate channels. The answer would be B (No).\n"
