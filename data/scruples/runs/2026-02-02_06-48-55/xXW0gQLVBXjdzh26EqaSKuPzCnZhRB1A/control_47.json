He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review during an exit interview. The scenario is pretty detailed. The boss is described as a bad manager with racist comments, hypocrisy, and other unprofessional behaviors. The author is considering reporting this to HR but is conflicted because they think the boss is a good person despite his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is to assess whether the author has a moral or ethical obligation to report the issues, given the severity of the problems described.\n\nThe boss's behavior includes racism, making offensive jokes, creating a hostile work environment, and poor management practices. These are serious issues that can affect not just the author but other employees. The author has documented incidents, which is good. However, they're worried about \"ruining his job\" even though the boss's actions are harmful.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's discrimination or harassment, reporting to HR is often recommended. The author is in a position to provide valuable information that could lead to changes. However, they are also considering the personal impact on the boss. The conflict here is between doing what's right for the workplace and personal ethics about harming another person.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not reporting? If the author chooses not to report, are they complicit in allowing a toxic environment to persist? On the other hand, if they do report, they might be acting in the right to prevent future harm, even if it affects the boss's job.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal by reporting. They are sharing their experiences, which HR is meant to handle. So, if they choose to report, they aren't in the wrong. However, if they decide not to report, is that in the wrong? The original question is about the act of giving a scathing review in the exit interview, not about reporting to HR. Wait, the original question says \"WIBTA if I gave a scathing review...\". But then the main content includes the thought about reporting to HR. The user's answer is about the author's potential wrongdoing, so we need to see if giving a negative review is wrong.\n\nExit interviews are typically for the employee to provide feedback. As long as the information shared is factual and not defamatory, the employee isn't in the wrong. The author has legitimate grievances. They are not in the wrong for providing honest feedback about their experience. Additionally, the racist behavior is a serious issue, so highlighting that in an exit interview is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
