He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving a bad review during an exit interview. The situation is that the boss is a lousy manager\u2014doesn't know what they're doing, wastes company resources, overworks employees, and has some racist and inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exit interview is for. It's supposed to be a way for the company to gather feedback on their management and work environment. Employees are usually encouraged to be honest there. The author is considering a scathing review, which might be harsh, but if the issues are real, like racism and harassment, that's serious.\n\nThe boss's actions include racist comments, making offensive jokes, and creating a hostile work environment. That crosses into discrimination and harassment, which are illegal. The author is half Chinese and faces specific slurs and jokes. Those are not just bad management; they're discriminatory and could be reported as HR issues.\n\nThe author is also talking about the boss's incompetence in managing projects, leading to wasted time and resources. While that's a business problem, the racial issues are more pressing. The author might be right to bring up the racism part, as that's a legal issue. However, the exit interview is the time to report such issues, but sometimes HR might not act if it's not documented properly. The author has a cataloged list with dates and details, which is good. But if they're only leaving a scathing review in the exit interview without filing a formal complaint, maybe it's not enough.\n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if giving a bad review is wrong. The answer depends on whether the review is truthful and based on actual experiences. Since the author has evidence, reporting the racist behavior is the right thing to do. However, making a scathing review without following proper channels might not be the best approach. But in the context of an exit interview, which is meant for feedback, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nBut the user also mentions that the boss is a \"good person,\" which is confusing. The author might feel conflicted about ruining the boss's job. However, if the boss is engaging in illegal behavior, that's a separate issue from being a good person. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal or unethical behavior, even if the person is otherwise well-meaning.\n\nSo the key points are: the racist and discriminatory behavior is a serious issue that should be reported. The author is not wrong for wanting to address that. The exit interview is the appropriate time to provide feedback, and if the issues are documented, it's their right to express those concerns. The author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up against discrimination.\n"
