He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a graphic designer with three coworkers, working under a boss who they describe as making their life hell. The boss is a bad manager\u2014doesn't know what they're doing, wastes company resources, overworks the employees, and has some racist and inappropriate comments. The author mentions being overworked, not getting overtime pay, and the boss making personal, offensive remarks, including racist jokes and inappropriate questions. There's also a list of documented incidents.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering a scathing review. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of exit interviews. Typically, exit interviews are opportunities for employees to provide feedback about their experience, often anonymously or confidentially. The goal is to give honest feedback to help the company improve. However, the line between honest feedback and defamation can be thin, especially if the statements are false or malicious.\n\nThe author has a list of documented incidents, which suggests they have evidence of the boss's behavior. The boss's actions include racial comments, inappropriate behavior, and poor management. These could be considered workplace harassment or discrimination, which are serious issues. If the author reports these to HR, they might be within their rights to do so, especially since they have documentation.\n\nHowever, the author is considering giving a \"scathing review,\" which might involve harsh or negative language. If the review is factual and based on documented evidence, it's more defensible. But if it's exaggerated or includes personal attacks without evidence, that could be problematic. The author is also contemplating whether to ruin the boss's job, which introduces intent. If the intent is malicious, even if the statements are true, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the boss's behavior includes illegal actions (racism, harassment), so the author has a right to report those. The author is in a vulnerable position as a minority employee facing discrimination, which is a protected class. Reporting such behavior is not only their right but also a responsibility to prevent others from facing the same issues.\n\nThe author's hesitation about ruining the boss's job versus the boss's actual wrongdoing is a moral dilemma. The boss may be a \"good person\" in some respects, but their professional conduct is harmful and possibly illegal. The author isn't just venting; they have specific, documented instances that could be reported through proper channels like HR.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the author's statements are true and pertain to illegal behavior, they are not in the wrong for reporting them. However, if the exit interview is a public forum or the review is shared outside HR without proper context, that could lead to defamation issues. But since the question is about the author's right to report to HR, and given the documentation, the author is likely justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author has valid reasons to report the boss's behavior, especially the discriminatory comments and harassment. They are not in the wrong for reporting factual issues, even if it's harsh. The answer would be B (No).\n"
