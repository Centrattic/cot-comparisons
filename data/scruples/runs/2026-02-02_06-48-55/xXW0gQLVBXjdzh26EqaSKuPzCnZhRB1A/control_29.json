He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they give a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The situation described involves a boss who's creating a hostile work environment with long hours, poor management, and racist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of an exit interview. Typically, exit interviews are meant for employees to provide feedback about their experience. However, they should be conducted respectfully and factually. The author mentions having a cataloged list of incidents with dates and locations, which suggests they have documentation. That's a good sign because it's based on specific, verifiable events rather than just personal opinions.\n\nThe boss's behavior includes racial microaggressions and inappropriate comments, which are serious. The author is Asian and has faced racist remarks from their boss. These comments could potentially be considered harassment under employment laws. The boss's actions such as making offensive jokes, discriminatory comments, and creating a hostile work environment might constitute workplace harassment or discrimination, which HR should be aware of.\n\nHowever, the author is questioning whether they should take this to HR upon leaving. They're concerned about ruining the boss's job but feel the need to report the misconduct. The key here is whether reporting is the right action. Since the boss's behavior is illegal and harmful, reporting it isn't about \"ruining his job\" but about addressing workplace violations. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking to report illegal or unethical behavior, especially when it's well-documented.\n\nOn the other hand, giving a \"scathing review\" during an exit interview might not be the most effective way. Exit interviews should ideally be constructive. However, the author's intent here is to report misconduct, which is different from just giving a bad review. If the author reports the specific incidents to HR factually, that's a responsible action. But if the review is purely negative and not based on facts, that could be problematic. The author does have documentation, so sharing that with HR is appropriate.\n\nThe ethical aspect: the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report harassment and discrimination. It's their right to work in a safe environment. The boss's actions are the issue here, not the employee's desire to report them. The author might also be considering the potential impact on the boss's job, but if the boss is violating company policies or laws, that's a matter for HR to handle.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong for reporting serious misconduct. They have a responsibility to themselves and possibly others to address harmful behavior in the workplace. The fact that they have documented incidents supports their case. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
