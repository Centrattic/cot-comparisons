He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The situation described is pretty intense. The boss is portrayed as someone who's not only a bad manager but also exhibits racist behavior and other inappropriate conduct.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of an exit interview. Typically, exit interviews are meant for employees to provide feedback about their experience, which companies use to improve. However, they can vary in terms of formality. Some are just for the employee's records, while others might be shared with HR or management. The key question here is whether the author is within their rights to express their negative experiences, especially regarding harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe author mentions the boss's racist remarks, inappropriate comments, and unprofessional behavior. These are serious issues that could fall under workplace harassment or discrimination, which are protected under various labor laws. The author has documented incidents with dates, which is important if they decide to report. So, if the author is reporting these issues to HR, they're not just venting; they're potentially raising legitimate concerns about illegal or unethical behavior.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering giving a \"scathing review.\" The line between constructive criticism and defamation is important here. While the author can express their personal experience and dissatisfaction, making false or exaggerated claims could lead to legal issues. But in this case, the author is recounting specific incidents that they experienced, which might be protected as truthful statements, especially if they're documenting harassment or discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is the employer's responsibility. Companies have a duty to maintain a safe work environment. By reporting the boss's behavior, the author might be fulfilling their responsibility to highlight issues that affect not just themselves but possibly others as well. However, the author is also considering the boss's personal life and character, saying he's a \"good person\" but a bad boss. That duality might complicate things, but the focus should be on the professional conduct.\n\nThe author is also concerned about potential retaliation or ruining the boss's job. But if the issues reported are legitimate, the responsibility lies with HR to investigate and take appropriate action. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for coming forward, especially when there's evidence to support the claims.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting genuine issues of harassment and discrimination. However, they need to ensure that their feedback is factual and based on documented evidence to avoid any defamation risks. The key here is the nature of the complaints\u2014serious misconduct that affects the workplace environment. Therefore, the answer would be B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
