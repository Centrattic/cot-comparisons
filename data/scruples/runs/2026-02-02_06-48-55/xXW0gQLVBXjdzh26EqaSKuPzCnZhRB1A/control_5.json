He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong if they give a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The options are A for yes or B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author describes a boss who's a terrible manager\u2014long hours, wasted resources, poor leadership, and also exhibits disgusting and racist behavior. The author is considering whether to report this to HR when they leave. They have a list of incidents documented. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do this.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the boss's behavior is unprofessional, racist, and creates a hostile work environment. The author is contemplating reporting this, which could affect the boss's job. The author is conflicted because they think the boss might be a good person otherwise but is still a bad manager and has inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, considering workplace ethics: is the author obligated to stay silent? Well, exit interviews are meant for employees to provide feedback. However, scathing reviews can sometimes be seen as vindictive if not constructive. However, in this case, the boss's actions include potential discrimination and harassment, which are serious issues. Reporting to HR isn't just about giving feedback but addressing possible illegal or unethical behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boss is indeed violating company policies or laws (like racism, creating a hostile environment), then the author is not in the wrong for bringing it up. In fact, they might have a responsibility to report it if they have documentation. On the other hand, if the author's review is purely malicious without evidence, that could be problematic. But in this case, the author has a cataloged list of incidents, so they have evidence.\n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the author is reporting legitimate issues that affect their workplace and others, especially when there's documentation. However, the exit interview is a tricky space. Some companies might consider it a personal opinion rather than formal complaint. But given the severity of the allegations (racism, harassment), it's a gray area. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to report these issues, especially if they believe it's in the interest of preventing harm to others.\n\nAlso, the author is considering not just giving a bad review but taking it to HR. So, it's more about formal reporting. If the company has a policy that encourages reporting such issues, then the author is in the right. But if they do it out of spite without basis, that's different. Here, the author has specific examples, which strengthens their case.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing legitimate, documented issues that go beyond just being a bad boss\u2014they involve unethical and possibly illegal behavior.\n"
