He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The situation described is pretty intense. The boss is making their life hell, working them 60+ hours a week without overtime pay, which is a problem because they're exempt. There's also the issue of the boss being racist and making inappropriate comments. The author is conflicted because they think the boss is a good person but is causing a lot of issues. They also have a list of offenses with dates and locations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The exit interview is a common practice where the company collects feedback from departing employees. However, if the review includes false or harmful information, that could be problematic. But in this case, the author has documented evidence of the boss's behavior. The boss's actions seem to include harassment and discrimination, which are serious. The author is concerned about potentially ruining the boss's job, but if the boss is indeed violating company policies or laws, the author might have a duty to report it, especially if they were harmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be tempted to exaggerate or vent, which could be unprofessional. But the examples given, like racist comments, inappropriate personal stories, and discriminatory remarks, are not just venting\u2014they\u2019re specific instances that could be considered harassment. The boss also has a pattern of poor management, such as changing project directions without cause and not compensating the employees properly. \n\nThe author is considering whether to report these issues to HR when they leave. They're worried about whether their actions would be wrong. If the information is factual and documented, then reporting it isn't wrong. It's actually a responsible action to take, especially if the company has policies against harassment and unlawful discrimination. The author's hesitation might stem from a desire to be fair to the boss, but if the boss's behavior is illegal or unethical, the author is within their rights to come forward.\n\nAlso, the boss's hypocrisy\u2014like taking random days off and being strict with the employees' schedules\u2014is a valid point. That could indicate unfair treatment and abuse of power. The author's role is to provide accurate feedback, not to be overly harsh. However, the boss's actions seem to cross into legal territory with the racist and discriminatory remarks. In that case, reporting isn't just venting; it's a legitimate concern that HR should be aware of.\n\nI think the key here is whether the review is factual and based on documented incidents. If the author presents their experiences truthfully without embellishment, they're not in the wrong. However, if they're lying or being unnecessarily harsh without evidence, then they would be. The scenario seems to present a well-documented case of harassment and poor management, so the author isn't in the wrong for reporting that. They might be in the right to do so, as it's about workplace safety and legality.\n"
