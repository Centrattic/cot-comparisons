He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for considering giving a scathing review of their boss during an exit interview. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a graphic designer working under a boss who they describe as making their life hell. The boss has issues with management, wastes company resources, is racist, makes inappropriate comments, and is hypocritical about work hours. The author is considering reporting this to HR when they leave.\n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought they are, but wants another opinion. The key here is to determine if the author's intentions and actions are justified.\n\nLooking at the details: The boss has serious misconduct, including racism, inappropriate comments, and poor management. The author has documented these incidents. The author is considering reporting to HR but is conflicted about ruining the boss's job. They mention that the boss is a \"good person\" despite these actions, which might complicate their moral stance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone has evidence of serious misconduct, including discrimination and harassment, it's often considered a responsibility to report it, especially for the well-being of others. However, the method and context matter. An exit interview is typically a formal process. If the author provides factual information during the exit interview without exaggeration or malice, it's within their rights. However, if the review is purely negative without constructive feedback, it could be seen as unprofessional. But given the severity of the issues (racism, harassment), the author has a legitimate reason to report.\n\nAnother angle: The author is concerned about not wanting to ruin the boss's job. This shows some ethical consideration, but the boss's actions may have already affected others. Reporting could prevent future harm. Additionally, the author is in a position to provide HR with necessary information to address these issues.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's review is overly emotional or lacks evidence, that could be problematic. But the original post mentions they have a cataloged list with dates and details, suggesting they are prepared to provide evidence. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the information is truthful and relevant, then no. The author is not wrong for wanting to report serious misconduct.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to report the boss's behavior, especially the racist and inappropriate comments, and have documentation to support their claims. Their intention is to address harmful behavior, which is ethically correct.\n"
