He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering a scathing exit interview review of their boss. The situation is complex. The author's boss has a lot of issues: poor management, racial comments, inappropriate behavior, and favoritism. The author is in a tough spot working long hours without overtime and dealing with a boss who's both unprofessional and discriminatory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author has a right to express their experiences, especially in an exit interview, which is meant to gather feedback. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The boss's actions described are problematic, including racism and harassment, which are serious. The author is documenting these issues, which is responsible, but the exit interview might not be the best place to air all grievances. HR is typically the right channel for formal complaints, especially those involving discrimination.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they think the boss is a good person. But the boss's actions are clearly harmful. The author is considering taking it to HR, which is a valid step for their protection and to report misconduct. However, the exit interview is usually a summary of their experience. Giving a scathing review there might affect their own reputation but is their right. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not reporting the boss's behavior through the proper channels instead of just venting in the exit interview.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but from the details, the author is documenting everything and considering HR, which is the right approach. The conflict is whether the exit interview is the place for such a review. If the author is planning to report to HR, maybe the exit interview isn't the only step. But if they don't report and just give a bad review, that could be problematic. However, the scenario says the author is considering both\u2014so the answer might depend on whether they act responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issues, especially if they go through HR properly. The answer would be B (No), because the author is right to hold the employer accountable for the boss's misconduct, even if they're conflicted about personal feelings.\n"
