He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I\u2019m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don\u2019t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I\u2019m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of marketing we\u2019re doing. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a new product, so he\u2019s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we\u2019re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he\u2019s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn\u2019t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn\u2019t like something he tells us, \u201cno,\u201d and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: \u201cI get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.\u201d \n\nOn top of all this, he\u2019s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he\u2019ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn\u2019t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I\u2019m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, \u201cwell if I was Treyvon Martin\u2019s parents I wouldn\u2019t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.\u201d He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the \u201cone night stand type\u201d in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I\u2019m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He\u2019s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he\u2019s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering a scathing exit interview review of their boss. The writer describes a boss with numerous problematic behaviors: micromanaging, making racist comments, being hypocritical about work hours, and creating a hostile work environment. The boss is also described as making personal, offensive remarks and displaying inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to confirm. The key here is to determine if the author is justified in their actions. The boss's actions include racial slurs, discrimination, and creating a toxic work environment. These could be considered harassment or discrimination, which are serious issues. The author has documented these incidents, which is good. However, the question is about whether giving a scathing review is wrong.\n\nIn many cases, employees have the right to voice their concerns, especially if there's a pattern of harmful behavior. However, the exit interview is a specific context. If the author provides factual, documented examples to HR, that's different from making defamatory or untrue statements. The author might be within their rights to report these issues, especially if they believe it could prevent harm to others. On the other hand, if the review is overly emotional or lacks evidence, it could backfire or be seen as unfounded.\n\nThe boss's behavior includes racist comments, which are legally protected under various employment laws. The author's documentation supports these claims, which is a strong point. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting these issues, as they're trying to address legitimate concerns. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the boss's actions and the author's documentation, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. If the exit interview is a formal HR process, then the author is fulfilling their responsibility to report issues. But if it's a personal attack without evidence, then it could be problematic. The scenario mentions a cataloged list with dates, so there's evidence. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
