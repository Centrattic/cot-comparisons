I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, and the author is upset because this is a pattern. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together 11 years. The partner already had six dogs, four of which were special needs. They had agreed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal after two died. But over the years, the partner kept getting more dogs without the author's consent. The latest one is a seventh dog with cancer, and the author is resisting bringing it home because they don't want to give in to what they see as emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed. They mention that the current number of dogs is already a part-time job, limiting their freedom. The partner's actions are making the author consider ending the relationship. The author is conflicted because they don't want the dog to die but also feel they're losing control.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. The partner is taking actions without discussing, which is a breach of mutual agreement. They've done it multiple times, which shows a pattern. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. The partner's argument about helping someone in need (the dog) isn't fair if it's a one-sided comparison. The author isn't refusing to help the dog because it's in need but because of the prior commitments and lack of communication.\n\nThe author isn't saying to kill the dog but is insisting on where it stays. They're standing their ground against repeated manipulations. Since the partner hasn't respected previous agreements, the author is justified in asserting their position. The emotional manipulation aspect is a key point here. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're protecting their relationship and their own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're maintaining their boundaries in a relationship where the partner has repeatedly disregarded their input. The author's feelings are valid given the history and the strain on their relationship.\n"
