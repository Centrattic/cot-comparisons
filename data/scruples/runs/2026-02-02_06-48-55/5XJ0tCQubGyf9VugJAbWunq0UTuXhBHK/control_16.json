I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong when their partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and now the author is resisting bringing it home because they don't want to feel manipulated again.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been together 11 years. The partner started with six rescue dogs, four special needs. They had discussions about 2-3 being ideal after two died. Then, over five years, the partner kept getting more without consulting the author, using a foster parent who emotionally manipulates him. The latest is a dog with possible cancer, which the partner wants to bring home now.\n\nThe author's main issue is the partner's pattern of bypassing their input, leading to an overwhelming number of dogs. The partner's justification is that he can't say no to dogs in need, but the author feels it's emotional manipulation. The partner then wants to bring the dog home for the night, but the author resists, fearing it's another \"win\" for the partner's manipulative behavior. The author loves dogs but feels the current number is unmanageable and that the partner's actions are contributing to considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the partner is definitely at fault for not consulting them and maintaining a pattern of unilateral decisions, especially when they had previously agreed on 2-3. The author is standing their ground on a mutual agreement and prioritizing their shared living situation. The partner's actions ignore the author's input and the established plan, leading to stress and possible resentment. The author's hesitation is not just about the dog's health but about the ongoing manipulation and lack of respect for their decision-making. The author has valid concerns about their lifestyle and the sustainability of having six dogs already. The partner's comparison to family needing a place to stay isn't fair because the author was not consulted in this case.\n\nThe key here is that the author is asserting their boundaries after repeated disregard by the partner. The partner's behavior is the main issue, and the author is not wrong for not wanting to be manipulated again. Their stance is about maintaining the agreed-upon number and not giving in to the partner's pattern. So, answer B for No.\n"
