I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're an asshole for not bringing the seventh rescue dog home.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their partner have been together for 11 years. The partner already has six rescue dogs, four of which are special needs. Two died, and they discussed keeping 2-3 dogs moving forward. But over the years, the partner kept adopting more without consent, up to six. Then recently, a seventh, which has cancer. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and that this is overwhelming. They don't want to bring the dog home because it feels like giving in to emotional manipulation. The partner says if family needed a place, he'd help, but the author thinks it's not the same. They love dogs but can't handle the number of dogs they have. The situation is causing serious relationship strain.\n\nSo, the key points are: the partner adopted another dog behind their back, the author is resisting bringing it home, and the partner is using emotional manipulation. The author is conflicted but stands by their decision to not let the dog come home.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the responsibilities and agreements. They had discussed 2-3 as ideal. The partner kept adding dogs without consulting, which is a breach of that agreement. The author is trying to enforce boundaries. The seventh dog is another case of the partner making decisions without consent, which could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The author's argument is about respecting their mutual agreement and not being manipulated into overcommitment. \n\nThe partner's defense is that he can't say no to dogs in need, which is understandable empathy, but he should have discussed it with his partner first. The author's priority is their shared life and the existing commitments. They can't manage more dogs, and this is leading to stress and relationship issues. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel by not bringing the dog home; they're trying to maintain boundaries. The partner's actions are the main issue here\u2014acting unilaterally and manipulating emotionally. The author's stance is about respecting their own limits and the prior agreements. They're not rejecting the dog out of malice but to prevent further strain. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their shared commitments and personal boundaries, which the partner has repeatedly ignored. The answer should be B.\n"
