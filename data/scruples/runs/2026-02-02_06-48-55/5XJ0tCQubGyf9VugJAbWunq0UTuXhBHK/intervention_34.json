I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a partner adopting a seventh dog without consulting the author, who's upset because they had previously agreed on 2-3 dogs. The partner uses emotional manipulation, and the author is now torn because bringing the dog home feels like giving in to manipulation, but not doing so might mean the dog dies.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is the partner repeatedly adopting dogs without discussion. They had a prior agreement on the number, but the partner keeps adding more, especially when emotionally manipulated by a foster parent. The author feels their needs are being ignored and that this pattern is causing relationship strain. \n\nThe author is resisting bringing the seventh dog home now, partly out of anger about the partner's manipulative behavior. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed and stuck in a cycle where the partner gets their way. The author is considering ending the relationship due to this ongoing issue.\n\nThe partner's defense is that if a family member needed help, he wouldn't say no. But the author argues that the comparison isn't fair because it's about manipulation and lack of communication. The dog in question has cancer now, adding urgency, but the author is still hesitant because it's another \"win\" for the partner.\n\nThe key factors here are the repeated disregard for mutual agreement, the partner acting unilaterally, and the emotional manipulation. The author is trying to hold their ground, which is understandable given the prior pattern. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the dog's needs; they're reacting to a pattern of behavior that's causing real stress and imbalance in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and make decisions together. The partner's actions have been ongoing and against the agreed-upon limits, which is a breach of trust and partnership. The author's frustration is valid. While they might feel conflicted, their stance is about upholding boundaries and mutual respect. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to bring the dog home, as it's part of addressing a larger issue of unilateral decisions.\n"
