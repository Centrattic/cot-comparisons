I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, after previously getting dogs behind their back. The key points here are the repeated unilateral decisions, the emotional manipulation, and the author's refusal to let the dog stay home because they don't want to feel like they've lost again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should communicate major decisions, especially ones that affect shared living conditions. The partner adopting dogs without discussion is a breach of that trust. The author is justified in being upset because their input was ignored, which is a valid concern in a long-term relationship.\n\nThen there's the emotional manipulation angle. The partner uses the dog's need for a home as a way to get what they want, which the author feels is manipulative. The author's resentment is about the pattern of behavior, not just one instance. The fact that they've discussed the ideal number of dogs before and the partner keeps exceeding it shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries.\n\nThe current conflict is whether to bring the dog home now that it's found to have cancer. The author is conflicted because they don't want to give in again, but they also care about the dog. However, their reluctance isn't about the dog's well-being but about the power struggle. That's a red flag. The author's main issue seems to be about losing control in the relationship rather than the dog's immediate needs. This could be seen as being inconsiderate towards the dog's welfare.\n\nBut wait, the author does mention loving dogs and wanting them to have homes. Their argument is about the practicality and the relationship dynamic. However, the partner's actions have been inconsiderate, so the author's stance is more about maintaining boundaries against manipulation. \n\nThe author's consideration of ending the relationship is a significant point. If the partner's behavior is leading to this, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing their own needs. However, the refusal to bring the dog home now might be seen as using the dog as a pawn in the conflict. The author is prioritizing their emotional state over the dog's care, which is problematic. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author is not wrong for standing up against the partner's manipulative actions. However, the dog's current situation (cancer, needing care) might require a different approach. The author's main fault is perhaps not addressing the issue through open communication rather than using the dog's placement as a point of contention. But given the context of repeated manipulation, the author is justified in their stance. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
