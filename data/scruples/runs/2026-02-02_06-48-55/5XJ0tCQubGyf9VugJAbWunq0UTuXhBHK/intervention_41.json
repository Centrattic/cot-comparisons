I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because they've previously discussed keeping the number of dogs to 2-3, especially since many of the existing dogs have special needs. The partner keeps getting dogs behind their back, often manipulated by a foster parent, and this latest one has cancer. The author refuses to let the dog come home, but then feels like they're losing a \"battle\" each time the partner uses emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves dogs but has a limit due to the workload. They've communicated this repeatedly. The partner, however, continues to adopt more dogs, which is a breach of trust. The author's main issue isn't the dog's welfare but the partner's manipulative behavior and lack of communication. The partner's argument is that they would help family in need, but the comparison might not apply because it's a pet, not a person in the same situation. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot here. On one hand, the dog might need a home and could face euthanasia otherwise. But the partner's pattern of behavior\u2014ignoring agreements, making unilateral decisions\u2014suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author is holding out because they don't want to enable this behavior again. However, the author is also not taking responsibility for the dog's care, which could mean the dog suffers. \n\nBut the main conflict is about the partner's manipulation and the author's frustration with being overruled. The author's refusal isn't about the dog's health but about not wanting to \"lose\" again. That seems to be about personal control rather than the dog's best interest. However, the author's position is that they've set a boundary and the partner isn't respecting it. So, is the author wrong for not bringing the dog home now?\n\nThe partner's actions are clearly problematic. Adopting without consent and ignoring prior agreements is a major issue. The author's stance is about maintaining boundaries. Even if the author is being rigid, the partner's behavior is worse. The author is justified in not wanting to enable the partner's manipulative tactics. The fact that the dog has cancer might make the situation more urgent, but the author's decision is based on principle. \n\nSo, while the author might be seen as being harsh, the core issue is the partner's repeated breaches of trust. The author isn't being an asshole for standing their ground. They're trying to protect their relationship by setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
