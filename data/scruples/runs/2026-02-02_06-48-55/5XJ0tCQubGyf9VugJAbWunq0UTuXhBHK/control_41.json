I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the partner has adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author. The author is upset because they've discussed before that 2-3 dogs is the ideal number. The partner has a history of getting dogs behind the author's back, using emotional manipulation, according to the author. The author is resisting bringing the dog home to avoid feeling like they're giving in again. The dog now has cancer, which adds to the emotional stakes.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they love dogs but feel overwhelmed. They mention the burden of caring for multiple dogs, which affects their quality of life and plans. The partner's argument is that he would help family in need, but the author sees it as a different situation. The author is considering ending the relationship due to this pattern.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and boundaries. The partner didn't consult the author about the seventh dog, going against prior agreements. The author is standing by those boundaries, refusing to let the dog come home until there's discussion. The author's concern is about the emotional manipulation and the impact on their life. They're not opposing helping the dog per se but the unilateral decisions.\n\nThe partner's actions involve not respecting the author's input, which is a significant issue. The author is asserting their right to be involved in decisions affecting their home and life. Even if the dog is in a bad situation, the partner's method of handling it without consent is problematic. The author's stance is about maintaining boundaries and mutual decision-making, which is reasonable in a relationship. The fact that this is a recurring issue suggests a pattern of disrespect from the partner.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a boundary in a relationship where the other person has a history of overstepping. Their feelings of being manipulated are valid, and their response is about self-respect and the health of the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
