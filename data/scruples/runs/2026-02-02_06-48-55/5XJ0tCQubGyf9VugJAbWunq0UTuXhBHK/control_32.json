I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and the author is conflicted because they don't want to give in to emotional manipulation again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had six rescue dogs, four of which were special needs. They had previously discussed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal after two died. But over the years, the partner kept adopting more dogs without the author's input, which the author sees as emotional manipulation. Now, the latest dog has cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home. The author is resistant because they feel like giving in would mean losing again to the manipulation, but they also love dogs and don't want the dog to die in a kennel.\n\nThe main issue here is about mutual decision-making. The partner is adopting dogs without discussing it, which the author finds inconsiderate. The author is standing their ground now, even though the dog is in a bad situation. They're considering ending the relationship because of this recurring problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the partner clearly broke the agreement they had previously. The author is not wrong for setting boundaries, especially after repeated instances. The partner's actions of adopting without consent are the main issue here. The author's hesitation isn't just about the dog's condition but about the partner's manipulative behavior. Even though the dog is in need, the author's right to be part of the decision shouldn't be overlooked. \n\nThe partner's argument about helping family isn't a valid comparison because it's a different scenario. The author's position is about respecting their input and not being manipulated. Since the partner has a history of this, the author is justified in feeling wronged. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries after being consistently ignored.\n"
