I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a partner bringing home a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because their partner has a history of doing this, and they feel manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner started with six dogs, four of which were special needs. They had discussed that two to three dogs would be ideal after two died. Then over the years, the partner kept adopting more dogs without the author's knowledge or consent, up to seven now. The latest dog, which has cancer, was supposed to stay at the partner's business but now the partner wants to bring it home. The author is resisting because they don't want to feel like they lost to the partner's manipulation again.\n\nSo the main issues here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind the author's back, even after they agreed on a number. The author is struggling because they love dogs but also can't handle more than a certain number. The emotional manipulation aspect is a key point\u2014they feel like saying yes would mean giving in to manipulation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the partner isn't considering their input, which affects their quality of life (no vacations, part-time job managing the dogs). They also mention considering ending the relationship because of this pattern. The partner's argument is that if someone in the author's family needed help, they'd do the same, but the author feels that's not a fair comparison because it's about a pet and past manipulation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are standing up for their boundaries. The partner has repeatedly broken agreements by adopting without consent. The author is not being cruel to the dog\u2014they're trying to balance their own well-being and the existing commitments. They\u2019re also not rejecting the dog out of hand because of the cancer; they just don't want to enable the partner's manipulative behavior again.\n\nThe partner's actions show a lack of respect for the author's input and the agreed-upon limits. The author is justified in feeling that their concerns are being overlooked repeatedly. Even though the partner's intent might be good (saving a dog), the method is problematic and has led to a pattern of behavior that's harmful to the relationship.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are protecting their boundaries and the relationship's health, which is valid.\n"
