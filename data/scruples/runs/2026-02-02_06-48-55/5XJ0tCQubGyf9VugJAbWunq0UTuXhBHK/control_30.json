I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, after prior agreements to keep the number of dogs down. The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind the author's back, despite discussions about limiting to 2-3 dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has put their foot down this time, not allowing the seventh dog into their home. They're upset because they feel manipulated and want to avoid giving in again. The partner argues that if family needed help, he wouldn't say no, but the author doesn't think that's a fair comparison. The author is worried about the dog's health (cancer) and the burden of caring for so many dogs. They're considering ending the relationship due to this ongoing issue.\n\nThe author's main argument is about respecting boundaries and mutual decision-making. They've tried to set limits before, and the partner kept adding dogs without discussion. This time, the author is standing their ground, which shows they're trying to be firm. The partner's actions seem to disregard the author's input, using emotional manipulation (like the foster parent's calls) to get their way repeatedly.\n\nThe partner's response about helping family isn't a valid comparison here. The dogs are not family in the same sense, and the author has a right to be involved in such major decisions. The author isn't being cruel to the dog by not bringing it home; they're trying to balance their resources and relationship health. The emotional manipulation is a red flag, and the author's concern about being taken advantage of is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their boundaries and the partner is the one being inconsiderate. The answer should be B.\n"
