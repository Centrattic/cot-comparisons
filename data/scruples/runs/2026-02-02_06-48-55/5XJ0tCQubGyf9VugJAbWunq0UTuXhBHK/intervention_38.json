I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and the author is resisting bringing it home, citing emotional manipulation and the burden of more dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without the author's input, even after discussing the ideal number of dogs. The author feels manipulated and overwhelmed by the responsibilities. The latest dog has possible cancer, which complicates things. The author's main issue isn't the dog itself but the pattern of behavior where their partner bypasses their input and makes unilateral decisions.\n\nThe author is concerned about the emotional manipulation and the impact on their relationship. They feel like they're losing every time their partner gets their way. The partner's argument is that they'd help family, but the comparison might not be fair because it's about a pet with prior patterns of manipulation. The author loves dogs but has practical limits, especially with their current setup.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions (adopting without discussion) are problematic, showing disregard for the author's input. The author is standing their ground, which is reasonable given the history. The author isn't being cruel to the dog but is setting boundaries against manipulation. The emotional toll and the practical issues (like time and resources) are valid concerns. The author's resistance isn't just about the dog but about respecting their own limits and partnership. So, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong; they're protecting their boundaries. Therefore, answer B.\n"
