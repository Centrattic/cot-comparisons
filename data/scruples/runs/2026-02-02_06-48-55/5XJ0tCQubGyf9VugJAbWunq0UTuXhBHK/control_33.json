I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, which is on top of previous instances where the partner got dogs without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because they had discussions about limiting the number of dogs, especially since some are special needs, and now this new dog has cancer. The author is resisting bringing the dog home because they feel it's another victory for the partner's emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and partner have been together for 11 years. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without consulting the author, who loves dogs but feels overwhelmed. They had agreed on 2-3 dogs being ideal after some of the previous ones died. The partner keeps getting more dogs, each time using emotional appeals to the foster parent. The latest dog has cancer, and the author is conflicted between not wanting to enable the partner's manipulation but also not wanting the dog to die.\n\nThe author is concerned about the practical aspects: the dogs require a lot of care, limiting their ability to have time off. The partner argues that if the author's family needed a place to stay, he would help, but the author feels this isn't a fair comparison. The author is considering ending the relationship due to this ongoing issue.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions involve not consulting the author, which is a breach of agreed-upon plans. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is necessary when there's a history of unilateral decisions. The partner's manipulation through the foster parent seems to be a recurring problem, and the author is trying to assert their needs. The author's resistance isn't about the dog's welfare (they love dogs) but about respecting their own limits. The partner isn't respecting the author's input, which is a problem in the relationship.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to help the dog out of cruelty; they're trying to prevent being manipulated again. The partner's actions are the issue here\u2014acting without consent and using emotional tactics. The author's stance seems reasonable given the circumstances, especially since they had previously discussed limits. The author's concern is valid; they're trying to maintain mutual decision-making in the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer would be B for No.\n"
