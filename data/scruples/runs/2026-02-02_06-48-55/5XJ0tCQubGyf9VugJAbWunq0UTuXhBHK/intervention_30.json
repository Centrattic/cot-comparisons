I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because they had previously agreed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal after some of the existing ones died. The partner has a history of getting dogs without their input, and this latest one has cancer. The author is holding out because they feel manipulated and don't want to give in, even though they love dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated with their partner's pattern of behavior\u2014adopting dogs without discussion, which is making their life harder. They mention that managing six dogs is already a part-time job, limiting their freedom. The partner's actions seem to be driven by compassion for the dog, but maybe not considering the author's boundaries. \n\nThe author is concerned about emotional manipulation. The partner is using the dog's needs to get their way, which the author feels is unfair. The author's hesitation to bring the dog home is not because they don't care, but because they want to avoid being manipulated again. They also love dogs and want to help, but there's a limit.\n\nLooking at the key points: The partner adopted the dog without consent, which breaks previous agreements. The author is standing their ground to maintain boundaries. The partner's argument about helping family isn't a direct comparison, as the dog isn't family. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and the pattern of manipulation.\n\nIs the author wrong for not bringing the dog home? Well, the dog's well-being is important, but the author is also trying to protect their relationship and their own boundaries. If the author gives in each time, the partner might continue this behavior, leading to more stress. The author's refusal isn't about the dog itself but about respecting mutual agreements and communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should have discussed the dog adoption. The partner's actions were wrong, but the author's response is about asserting their needs. The author's concern about the dog's cancer might also be a factor\u2014maybe they feel they can't say no if the dog is clearly in need, but they're worried about future dogs. However, the author is not the one who adopted the dog without consent; the partner did that. The author is trying to hold the line, which is a reasonable response to prevent further manipulation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a boundary that was agreed upon and prevent being manipulated again. The partner is the one who broke the agreement. The author's feelings are valid, and they have a right to be upset about the lack of communication and the pattern of behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
