I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner, despite previous discussions about limiting the number of dogs. The key points are the emotional manipulation by the foster parent, the partner's pattern of bringing dogs in without consent, and the current conflict over the new dog's health and living arrangements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussing it with the other person. They had agreed on an ideal number of dogs (2-3), but the partner keeps adding more, which is a breach of that agreement. The author feels that their partner is using emotional manipulation, especially through the foster parent, to get their way. This repeated behavior is causing significant stress and is leading the author to consider ending the 11-year relationship.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they are not in the wrong because they are standing up for their boundaries. They love dogs but believe there's a limit to how many they can responsibly care for. The partner, on the other hand, is seen as the one who is manipulative and inconsiderate by making decisions unilaterally. The fact that the new dog has cancer complicates things, but the author is not willing to bring it home because it would mean losing the argument, not because they don't care about the dog.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. I need to assess if the author is being unreasonable. The author is enforcing a boundary that was previously discussed. Letting the dog stay at the business is a compromise, but the partner is trying to bring it home, which the author is resisting. The author's concerns are about the partner's manipulative behavior and the impact on their relationship. They are also considering their own well-being and the sustainability of the situation.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication and mutual respect are key. The partner's actions show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries, especially with repeated instances of adopting dogs without consent. The author isn't refusing to help the dog out of malice but because of the established agreement and the partner's manipulative tactics. The author's feelings about not wanting to \"lose\" the argument could be a red flag for underlying issues in the relationship, but it's also understandable given the partner's history.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is prioritizing the agreed-upon number of dogs and their own capacity to care for them. The partner's actions might be well-intentioned (saving a dog), but they are causing harm to the relationship. The author is not being inconsiderate by not wanting to take in more dogs; they are upholding their part of the agreement. The key point is whether the author's refusal is inconsiderate versus the partner's manipulative behavior. Since the partner broke the agreement, the author is justified in enforcing boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are standing up for their needs and the previously agreed-upon boundaries. The partner's actions are the main issue here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
