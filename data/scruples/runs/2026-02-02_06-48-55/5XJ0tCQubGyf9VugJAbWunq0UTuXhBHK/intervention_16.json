I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner, who's been put off by years of this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner has already six dogs, four of which are special needs. They had agreed on 2-3 dogs moving forward, but the partner kept getting more rescues without discussion. The latest dog has cancer and is being kept at his business. The author is resisting bringing it home, not because they don't care about the dog, but because they feel manipulated and want to avoid giving in again. They're even considering ending the relationship because of this pattern.\n\nThe author's stance is that they love dogs but have a limit. The partner's actions are seen as manipulative and inconsiderate, leading to a strain on their relationship. The author is conflicted because they don't want to take the dog in, fearing it's another win for the partner's emotional manipulation. However, they also don't want the dog to die if they return it. \n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not bringing the dog home, despite its condition. But the core issue here is the lack of communication and the pattern of behavior from the partner. The partner adopted the dog without consent, using emotional manipulation, which the author has been experiencing for years. The author is standing their ground, which seems justified given the history. \n\nThe author is not malicious; they care about the animals but have practical limits. Their refusal isn't to be cruel but to set a boundary against manipulation. The partner's actions are the problem here\u2014acting unilaterally and not respecting agreed-upon limits. The author is trying to maintain their own agency in the relationship, which is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to protect the relationship's health and their own well-being by not giving in to manipulation. The partner is the one at fault for not communicating and respecting the author's boundaries. The author's hesitation is understandable given the partner's history. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
