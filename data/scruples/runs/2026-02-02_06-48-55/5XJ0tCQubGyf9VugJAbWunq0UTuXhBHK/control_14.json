I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge, and the author is refusing to let it come home. The partner has a history of getting more dogs without consulting them, and the author is frustrated because they feel manipulated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The background says they've been together for 11 years. Initially, there were six rescue dogs, four of which had special needs. After two died, they agreed on 2-3 as the ideal number. But the partner kept getting more dogs without the author's input. The latest one is the seventh, with cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home. The author is hesitant because they don't want to enable the partner's manipulative behavior and are worried about the responsibilities.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and boundaries. The partner repeatedly got dogs without consulting the author, despite prior agreements. The author is now standing their ground, but the partner is using emotional manipulation, like the dog needing a home and the argument about family needing a place to stay. The author is conflicted because they love dogs but feel overwhelmed and manipulated. They're even considering ending the relationship.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions are clearly a problem\u2014breaking agreements, not consulting, and emotional manipulation. The author is trying to set limits, which is reasonable. The fact that they've discussed this multiple times and the partner ignores their input shows a lack of respect for the author's wishes. The author's reluctance to bring the dog home isn't just about the dog but about the partner's behavior. They're not being selfish; they're standing up for their boundaries. The partner's argument about family isn't a fair comparison because the dogs are a long-term commitment with prior agreements broken. \n\nThe author's concern about being overwhelmed is valid. Having six dogs is already a big responsibility, and adding another without discussion adds stress. The fact that the partner is using the dog's situation as a way to \"win\" is manipulative. The author isn't the one at fault here; they're the one trying to maintain the relationship's health by setting boundaries. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the author is justified in their stance given the partner's repeated disregard for their input and the existing agreements.\n"
