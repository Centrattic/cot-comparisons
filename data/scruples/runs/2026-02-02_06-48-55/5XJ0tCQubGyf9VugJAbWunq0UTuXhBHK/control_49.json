I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, after previous instances of adopting dogs secretly. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and want to maintain a limit of 2-3 dogs. The partner brings the dog home anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without the author's input, despite previous agreements. The author is concerned about the number of dogs, their care, and the impact on their relationship. The partner uses emotional appeals, like the dog needing a home, which the author feels is manipulation.\n\nThe author's main issue is the lack of communication and the partner's tendency to make unilateral decisions, which is causing strain on the relationship. They also mention considering ending the 11-year relationship because of this behavior. The author isn't opposed to helping animals but believes there's a limit and that mutual agreement is necessary.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions\u2014adopting without consent and emotionally manipulating\u2014are problematic. The author is standing their ground by refusing to let the dog come home unless it's for a short period. They're trying to enforce the previously discussed limit. The author's hesitation isn't about the dog's well-being but about feeling manipulated, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe partner's comparison to family needing help isn't fair because it's about different situations. The author's stance is about respecting boundaries and communication. Since the partner repeatedly disrespects those boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their position. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. They\u2019re not refusing help altogether but are concerned about the number of dogs and the partner's manipulative behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and the relationship's health, which is important. The partner's actions are the main issue here.\n"
