I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge, and the author is resisting bringing it home. The partner has a history of adopting more dogs without consulting the author, leading to a situation where the author is feeling manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The couple has been together for 11 years, and the partner has a pattern of acquiring rescue dogs without the author's input. The author feels that their partner is using emotional manipulation to get his way. The key points are that the partner adopts dogs behind their back, leading to a significant number of dogs which are a burden, and the author is reluctant to bring the newest dog home because they don't want to \"lose\" the argument again.\n\nThe author is torn between their love for dogs and the stress of managing so many. They mention that having six dogs is already a part-time job, limiting their ability to have time off. The partner's actions are affecting their relationship, making the author seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship. The partner argues that if family needed help, he would do the same, but the author feels the comparison isn't fair because the issue is about unilateral decisions and emotional manipulation.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not opposing the adoption because of the dog's well-being but because they feel manipulated. They\u2019re trying to set boundaries after repeated instances. The partner's behavior of making unilateral decisions without discussion is problematic. The author is standing up for themselves, which is reasonable. The fact that the partner is using emotional manipulation tactics (like getting a foster parent to contact him) to get more dogs is a key issue here. The author is trying to protect their relationship and their own limits, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering not bringing the dog home even though it has cancer. However, their reasoning is about not giving in to manipulation rather than the dog's welfare. The partner's argument about family isn't a valid comparison because it's about different contexts. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and decision-making together, which is a legitimate concern in a relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after repeated instances of the partner acting without their input. The partner's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
