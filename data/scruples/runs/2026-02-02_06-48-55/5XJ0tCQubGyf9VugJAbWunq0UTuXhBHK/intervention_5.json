I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario (the author) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The partnership has been going on for over 11 years, and there's a history of the partner getting dogs without the author's input. They had previously agreed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal, especially after some of the existing dogs died. But the partner kept adding more, influenced by a foster parent who the author feels is emotionally manipulating him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The partner kept adopting dogs without the author's consent, which is a violation of their mutual agreement. The author is frustrated because each time, they end up having to deal with the consequences, like the time and effort required to care for the dogs. Now, with the seventh dog having cancer, the author is upset not just about the dog's health but also about the partner's pattern of behavior. The author feels that agreeing to bring the dog home would mean giving in to emotional manipulation again, leading to resentment.\n\nThe author's main argument is about respecting boundaries and prior agreements. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed and taken advantage of. The partner, on the other hand, is framing their actions as helping a dog in need, using the example of family needing a place to stay. However, the comparison might not hold because the partner isn't consulting the author for decisions about the family, which is a different context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that the partner is being manipulative, and their refusal isn't about the dog's well-being but about standing their ground. The partner's actions have been repeated over years, which suggests a pattern of disregard for the author's input. The author's decision to not bring the dog home now is a reaction to this ongoing behavior. While the author might feel guilty, their concern is valid because the partner's actions have led to a cumulative burden.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the partner is the one who made decisions without consent, breaking their prior agreements. The author is trying to set a boundary to prevent further manipulation. Even though the dog's health is poor, the author's refusal isn't about the dog's life but about the partner's pattern of behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their needs and boundaries after years of this pattern. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
