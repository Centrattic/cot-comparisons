I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, who's now upset about it. The key points are the partner's history of adopting dogs behind their back and the emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had six dogs, four with special needs, and after two died, they agreed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal. But the partner kept adopting more without discussing it. That's a problem because it shows a pattern of disregarding the other's input. The writer is angry because each time, their partner uses the foster parent to emotionally manipulate them into taking in more dogs, and they feel like they're losing the argument every time.\n\nNow, the seventh dog was adopted secretly, and the partner says it will stay at his business. The writer is conflicted because bringing the dog home would mean giving in to the emotional manipulation again, but not doing so might harm the dog. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed by the current number and the responsibility. The partner argues that if their family needed a place to stay, he'd never say no, which is a fair comparison. But the writer isn't sure if that's relevant here. \n\nThe main issues are about consent in a relationship and the partner's pattern of behavior. Even though the writer loves dogs, the partner is repeatedly making decisions without consulting them, which is a breach of trust and partnership. The writer's anger is understandable because it's about being respected and having a say in shared responsibilities. The fact that the dog has cancer adds emotional weight, but the core problem is the partner's manipulation and lack of communication. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author is not the one at fault. The partner is the one acting unilaterally, using emotional tactics, and not respecting boundaries. The author is trying to maintain a balance and is considering ending the relationship due to this pattern. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
