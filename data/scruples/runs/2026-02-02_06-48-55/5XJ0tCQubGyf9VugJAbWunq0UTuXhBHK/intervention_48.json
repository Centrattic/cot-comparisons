I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to bring the seventh rescue dog home, even after learning it has cancer. The situation is complex because of long-term emotional manipulation and a history of the partner adopting dogs without consent.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been together 11 years, and the partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussing with the author. The author has tried to set boundaries, saying 2-3 dogs is ideal, but the partner keeps getting more, manipulating the author's compassion. The latest dog was adopted behind the author's back, and the author is resisting bringing it home to avoid giving in again. The dog's health issue adds another layer of emotional pressure.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that bringing the dog home would let the partner \"win\" again, reinforcing the pattern of manipulation. They are frustrated with the lack of communication and the impact on their life (can't go on trips, etc.). The partner's argument that he'd never say no to family isn't a fair comparison, though, as the author isn't refusing help to people but is about past manipulative actions.\n\nKey points to consider: Emotional manipulation is a serious issue, especially in long-term relationships. The author is trying to set a boundary to prevent being taken advantage of again. On the other hand, the dog's welfare is a concern, but that's part of what the partner is using to manipulate. The author isn't being cruel; they're trying to protect their relationship from toxic behavior. The fact that they're considering ending the relationship shows they're not okay with this pattern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're standing up for themselves against manipulation, which is necessary. They're not rejecting the dog out of cruelty but to prevent further emotional control. The partner's actions are the main problem here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
