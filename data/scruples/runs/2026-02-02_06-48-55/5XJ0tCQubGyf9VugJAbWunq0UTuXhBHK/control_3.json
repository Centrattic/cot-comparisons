I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person described in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, leading to conflict. The author of the post is the one who found out after the fact and is now resisting bringing the dog home because they feel manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years, and they've had discussions about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The partner has adopted several dogs over the years without the author's knowledge, even after previous dogs died. The latest dog was adopted behind their back and has cancer. The author is upset because they feel their partner is using emotional manipulation, and they don't want to cave in again. The partner argues that if family needed help, they'd do it, but the author sees it as a different situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussion, despite agreed limits. The author is standing their ground, not allowing the dog into the home, which the partner uses emotional arguments for. The author is struggling with the emotional weight and the practicality of caring for more dogs, but also the pattern of manipulation.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamic perspective, the partner's actions show a pattern of disregarding the other person's input, which can be a red flag. The author is trying to set boundaries after repeated instances. While the author does care about the dog's welfare, their main conflict is the manipulation and lack of communication. The partner's argument about helping family isn't a valid comparison because the author is focused on the consistent pattern of behavior without consent.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're trying to maintain the agreed-upon number and prevent being manipulated again. The practical concerns about time and resources are valid. The emotional manipulation and the partner's history make the author's frustration reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The partner is the one acting inconsiderately and manipulatively. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
