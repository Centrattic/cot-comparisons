I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a couple with an ongoing issue regarding the number of rescue dogs their partner is adopting without consulting the other. The author is upset because the partner keeps bringing in more dogs, even after they've agreed on a limit, and this time it's the seventh dog. The partner adopted it secretly, and now the dog has cancer, making the author feel like they're being manipulated again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They\u2019ve been together for 11 years, and the partner has had 6 dogs from the start, with 4 being special needs. They discussed reducing to 2-3 dogs after two died. The partner, however, kept taking in more dogs, each time without the author's knowledge. The latest dog has cancer and is supposed to stay at the business but the partner wants to bring it home. The author is resisting because they feel it's another example of manipulation and not considering their input.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed. The partner's actions are leading to a possible end of the relationship. The author is questioning if they\u2019re being an asshole by not allowing the dog to come home, especially since it might have cancer.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is about boundaries and communication. The partner repeatedly ignored the agreed-upon limits and made unilateral decisions, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The author is standing their ground, even though they love animals, because the partner's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the relationship's health by setting a boundary.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The partner's actions are clearly problematic\u2014breaking agreements, not communicating, and manipulating. The author is not wrong for feeling that their boundaries are being crossed. By not bringing the dog home, the author is trying to assert their position and stop being manipulated. Even though the dog has cancer, the author's justification is about maintaining their own emotional and practical limits. \n\nThe partner's argument about family members needing a place to stay isn't a fair comparison because it's not the same as animals being manipulated through emotional pleas. The author's stance is about respecting their own boundaries and not giving in to manipulation tactics. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary, even if it seems harsh. They\u2019re prioritizing their relationship's health and their own capacity to manage the dogs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
