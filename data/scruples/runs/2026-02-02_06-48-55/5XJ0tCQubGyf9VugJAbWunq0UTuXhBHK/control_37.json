I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because this has happened multiple times and feels manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the background. The couple has been together 11 years. They already had 6 dogs, some with special needs. They discussed that 2-3 is ideal after two died. But the partner keeps getting more dogs without input, using emotional manipulation. The latest dog has cancer, and the author doesn't want to bring it home because they feel like they would lose the argument again.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about the burden of having so many dogs, the lack of consultation, and feeling manipulated. The partner, on the other hand, is trying to save the dog by keeping it at his business and wants to bring it home. The author is conflicted because they love dogs but can't handle more than a certain number, and they feel this is a pattern.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and mutual decision-making. The partner repeatedly adopted dogs without consulting the author, which is a problem. The author is setting boundaries now, which is reasonable. They're standing their ground, not wanting to be manipulated again. The partner's actions are inconsiderate of the author's feelings and the practical aspects of dog ownership. \n\nThe author's concern about being overwhelmed with 6 dogs already is valid. Adding another one without discussion is a breach of trust. Even though the partner's intentions are good (saving the dog), the method is flawed. The author isn't being cruel to the dog but is prioritizing their relationship's health. \n\nThe partner's comparison to family staying with them isn't fair because the context is different. The author isn't refusing to help in emergencies but is asking for mutual decisions. The author is also considering their own well-being and the sustainability of their home. \n\nGiven all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs and trying to maintain a healthy relationship dynamic. The partner is the one manipulating and not respecting boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
