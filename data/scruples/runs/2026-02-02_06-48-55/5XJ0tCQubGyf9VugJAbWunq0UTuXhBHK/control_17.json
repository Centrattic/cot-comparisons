I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong in their situation with their partner and the seventh rescue dog. \n\nFirst, let's look at the background. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had six rescue dogs, four of which were special needs. They had discussed that two to three dogs would be ideal after two dogs died. But over the years, the partner kept adopting more dogs without consulting the author. The foster parent seems to manipulate him into taking in more dogs, knowing he can't say no.\n\nThe key points here are that the partner adopted another dog without discussing it, which the author is upset about. The author is angry because it's a pattern of behavior and they feel manipulated. Now, the seventh dog has cancer, and the author is refusing to let it come home because they don't want to give in to the partner's manipulation. The partner argues that if someone in the author's family needed a place to stay, he wouldn't say no, but the author thinks that's an unfair comparison because the issue is about manipulation and not the dog itself.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed with the current number. They can't take vacations, and it's a significant responsibility. The situation is causing serious relationship stress, and the author is considering ending the 11-year relationship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The partner did adopt the dog without consent, which is a breach of trust. The author is setting boundaries by not allowing the dog to come home, which is their right. They have a valid reason based on prior discussions and the existing burden. The partner's argument about family isn't a fair comparison because the situation isn't the same, and the emotional manipulation is the core issue here. The author is justified in wanting to maintain the agreed-upon limit and not feeling pressured into another decision without input.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid. They're not being cruel to the dog; they\u2019re trying to protect their household dynamics and their own mental health. The partner's actions are the main problem here, not the author's response. The author isn't being inconsiderate to the dog's needs but is standing up against a pattern of manipulation. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
