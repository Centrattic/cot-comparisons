I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and the author refusing to bring the dog home, partly because they don't want to feel like they're losing an argument to emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The partner has a history of adopting multiple rescue dogs, some with special needs. The author mentions that they discussed keeping it to 2-3 dogs moving forward. However, the partner keeps adopting more dogs without consulting them, especially influenced by a foster parent who the author thinks is emotionally manipulating him. The latest dog has cancer, which adds another layer to the situation. The author is resisting bringing the dog home because they don't want to capitulate to the partner's manipulative tactics, even though they love dogs and want to help.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting each other's boundaries and communication. The partner is repeatedly making decisions without consulting the author, which affects both of their lives. The author is upset because they feel their input isn't considered, and now they're in a position where they have to manage multiple dogs, which is a significant responsibility. The author's refusal to bring the dog home isn't just about the dog but about standing up for their own limits and not feeling like they're losing in the relationship.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but now is seeking a different perspective. The question is whether the author is wrong for not bringing the dog home, considering their reasons. The author's reasons include wanting to set boundaries and not enabling manipulative behavior, as well as the practical burden of more dogs.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal is justified. If the partner is consistently disregarding the author's wishes and making unilateral decisions, especially after agreed-upon limits, then the author's response is about maintaining their own agency. The fact that the partner uses emotional manipulation (like the foster parent exploiting the partner's softness for animals) complicates things. The author's stance is about protecting their own mental health and the relationship's health, not just about the dogs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could be more empathetic to the partner's desire to help the dog, especially knowing the dog's condition. But the author also has valid concerns about the sustainability of the situation and the partner's history of not respecting their boundaries. The author's decision to not bring the dog home is a way to set a boundary and prevent further manipulation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasons are rooted in the partner's pattern of behavior and the need to establish mutual respect and communication. The partner is the one acting inconsiderately by not consulting and manipulating emotions. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
