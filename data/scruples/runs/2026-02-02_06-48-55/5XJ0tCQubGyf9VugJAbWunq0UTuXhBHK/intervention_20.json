I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite prior agreements on keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The author is upset because they feel emotionally manipulated and that their partner is always getting his way. They're considering ending the relationship but are conflicted about taking in the new dog with cancer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussing it, even after previous deaths of dogs. The author feels their autonomy is being disregarded. The main conflict is about the partner's decision-making without consent and the author's resistance to another dog, especially one with health issues. The author is worried about the dog's well-being but also about the partner's manipulative tactics.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The partner's actions involve repeated disregard for the author's input, which is a red flag in a relationship. The author's stance on not taking in the dog without discussion seems reasonable, especially given prior agreements. The partner's defense comparing it to family needing help doesn't hold because the context is different\u2014differences in responsibility and emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author's concern about being manipulated and the impact on their joint life is valid. They're managing a significant number of dogs already, which is a strain. The new dog's health issues add another layer. The author's refusal isn't about the dog's fate but about standing their ground against manipulation. Ending the relationship is a serious step, indicating deep dissatisfaction, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their stance is about respecting boundaries and mutual decision-making in the relationship. The partner's actions are the main issue here, not the author's response to protect their own limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
