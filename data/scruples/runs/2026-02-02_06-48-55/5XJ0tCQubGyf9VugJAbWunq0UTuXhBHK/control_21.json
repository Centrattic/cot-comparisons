I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and they're angry about it. The author is considering not bringing the dog home now because they don't want to give in to emotional manipulation again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple has been together for 11+ years. The partner initially had six rescue dogs, four with special needs. Two died, and they had agreed on 2-3 being ideal. Over five years, the partner kept taking in more dogs without consulting the author, using the foster parent's emotional appeals. Now the seventh dog has cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home overnight. The author is conflicted because they don't want to enable manipulative behavior but also don't want the dog to suffer.\n\nSo the key points here: the partner consistently disregarded the author's input by taking in more dogs without discussion. The author is standing their ground this time, even though the dog has cancer. The partner is using the argument that if the author's family needed a place to stay, they wouldn't say no, implying inconsistency. The author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed by the number and the responsibilities. They're thinking of ending the relationship because of this pattern.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions are clearly problematic\u2014adopting dogs without consent, especially when they had prior agreements. The author is trying to enforce the earlier discussions about the number of dogs. The seventh dog is in a bad health situation, so maybe the partner's intention is to care for it, but the method is manipulative. The author's resistance isn't about the dog's well-being but about the principle of the partner making unilateral decisions. However, the author also mentions that if they knew the dog was going to die soon, they would bring it home, which shows they care.\n\nThe author's stance seems justified because the partner's behavior has been inconsiderate and manipulative, breaking prior agreements. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is important in a relationship. Even though the dog is in a bad situation, the partner's actions repeatedly undermined the author's input. The author isn't refusing the dog out of cruelty but to avoid giving in to the partner's manipulation. The partner's comparison to family is weak because the context is different\u2014this is about rescue animals and ongoing decisions. The author has valid reasons for not wanting more dogs, especially given the existing workload and past patterns. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
