I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other. The author is upset because it's behind their back and they feel manipulated. The partner has a history of this, starting from 5 years ago, and now the dog might have cancer.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author mentions that they and their partner discussed keeping 2-3 dogs as ideal after some dogs died. But the partner keeps taking in more. The author feels that this is emotional manipulation and that the partner isn't respecting their boundaries. The partner argues that if family needed a place to stay, they wouldn't say no, but the comparison isn't fair because it's not about a person but a dog. The author is frustrated by the pattern of behavior that's causing stress and affecting their relationship.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the partner is making decisions without their input. The partner uses the dog's welfare as a justification, which might be seen as emotional manipulation. The author is standing their ground by not allowing the dog into the home, which is their way of resisting the manipulation. However, they're also conflicted because they love dogs and don't want the dog to suffer. The partner's actions are leading the author to consider ending an 11-year relationship due to this pattern.\n\nFrom the partner's perspective, they see themselves as helping a dog in need, but they're not respecting the mutual agreement they had. The author is trying to enforce their previous discussions, so not letting the dog come home could be seen as standing up for their own needs. However, the dog is in a bad situation (possible cancer, only having three legs), and the author is worried about being manipulated again. The partner's argument about family isn't a strong analogy because it's a pet, but the author's point is about decision-making without consent.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're trying to set boundaries. The partner's repeated actions without discussion are the main issue. The author's refusal to bring the dog home is a way to assert their position. While the dog's well-being is a concern, the partner's behavior is the root problem here. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to maintain their household's stability and mutual agreements. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
