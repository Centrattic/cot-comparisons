I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author, despite previous discussions about keeping the number of dogs down. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and are considering ending the relationship. They're conflicted because they love dogs but don't want to enable the partner's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The partner has taken in multiple dogs over the years, some with special needs, and each time without the author's agreement. The author feels that this is a pattern of emotional manipulation and that their input isn't respected. The latest dog has cancer, and the author is reluctant to bring it home, fearing it's another 'victory' for the partner. The partner uses the argument about family needing a place to stay, which the author doesn't think is a fair comparison.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The partner's actions seem to be a repeated pattern, not a one-time incident. The author feels that their concerns about the number of dogs and the responsibilities involved aren't taken seriously. The partner uses emotional appeals to get their way, which is a form of manipulation. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The fact that the partner continues to bring in more dogs without discussion suggests a lack of respect for the author's input.\n\nThe author's main conflict is between their love for animals and their frustration with the partner's behavior. They don't want to take in the dog because it would validate the partner's manipulative tactics. The partner's argument about helping others (using family as an example) might not be the best analogy, as the dog's situation is different. The author is in a tough spot, trying to assert their needs in a relationship where their boundaries are frequently disregarded.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They\u2019re standing up for their own needs and setting boundaries. Even though the dog is in a bad situation, the author can't be expected to always give in to the partner's manipulation. The partner's actions are the main issue here. The author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're trying to address the relationship dynamic. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a healthy relationship by communicating their limits.\n"
