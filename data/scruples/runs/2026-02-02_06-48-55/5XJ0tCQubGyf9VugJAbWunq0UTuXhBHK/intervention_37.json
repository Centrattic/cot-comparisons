I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without their consent, despite having agreed to keep the number of dogs to 2-3. The author is upset about the partner's decision, considering it emotional manipulation and a pattern of behavior that's causing them to think about ending the 11-year relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussion, which the author feels is manipulative. The author is concerned about the practical aspects of having seven dogs, especially since they can't take vacations or even short trips. They also mention that the partner's actions are undermining their input, making the author feel like they lose control. \n\nThe partner's justification is that they can't say no to dogs in need, and the author feels trapped because returning the dog might mean euthanasia. The author's main conflict is between their love for animals and their frustration with the partner's decision-making process. The author is resisting bringing the dog home to avoid giving in to what they see as manipulation.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for a different perspective. To determine if the author is in the wrong, I should evaluate if their stance is unreasonable. The author is setting boundaries to protect their own well-being, which is valid. They have a history of this issue, and the partner's actions are causing significant strain in the relationship. The author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're prioritizing their own mental health and the agreed-upon household rules.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might argue that they're helping a dog in need. However, the problem is the lack of communication and respect for the author's boundaries. The author isn't refusing the dog out of malice but to prevent a recurring pattern that affects their life. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs in a relationship where their partner's actions are causing consistent issues. The author's resistance isn't about the dog's fate but about respecting their own limits and the agreed-upon partnership. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
