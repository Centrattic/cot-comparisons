I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their partner's consent, which the author is resisting because they feel it's part of a pattern of emotional manipulation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner initially had six rescue dogs, four with special needs. Two died, leading to a discussion about keeping the number at 2-3. Over five years, the partner kept adopting more dogs without consulting the author. The seventh dog, which now has cancer, is the latest conflict. The author feels manipulated and is considering ending the relationship because they can't cope with more dogs and the partner's behavior.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to bring the dog home despite the partner's insistence. The author's reasoning is that allowing this would mean \"losing\" to manipulation and perpetuate a cycle where the partner makes unilateral decisions. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed and that their partner isn't respecting their input.\n\nOn one hand, the partner is trying to save a dog in need, which is commendable. However, repeatedly adopting dogs without consultation shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries and concerns. The author's refusal isn't about the dog's well-being but about standing against the manipulation. They're in a tough spot, balancing compassion for the dog with their own limits and the relationship's health.\n\nThe partner's argument about helping family is a false equivalence. Dogs and people have different dynamics in terms of care and emotional needs. The author's stress about the dogs being a part-time job and limiting their lifestyle is valid. They have legitimate reasons to set boundaries, especially when repeatedly ignored.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not giving in. Since the partner's actions have been manipulative and inconsiderate, the author is justified in asserting their limits. They're not being cruel to the dog but are protecting their own well-being and the relationship's future. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
