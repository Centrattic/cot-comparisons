I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner, despite prior agreements. The author is upset because this seems like a pattern of manipulation and inconsiderate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had 6 rescue dogs, 4 of which had special needs. They discussed multiple times that 2-3 dogs would be ideal. But over the years, the partner kept taking in more dogs without consulting the author. The latest one is a seventh dog with cancer, and the author is resisting bringing it home because they feel it's another win for the partner's manipulation.\n\nThe author's main argument is about the partner's manipulative behavior and disregarding their input. They feel overwhelmed by the number of dogs and the responsibilities, which affects their quality of life. The partner, on the other hand, uses emotional appeals, like the dog needing a home and comparing it to family emergencies.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The partner's actions show a pattern of not communicating and making unilateral decisions, which is inconsiderate. However, the author is also resisting taking in a dog that needs help, possibly because of past manipulative tactics. \n\nBut wait, the author is standing their ground about the prior agreements and the overwhelming situation. They love dogs but can't handle the number. The partner's actions are breaking the trust established by their discussions. The author's hesitation isn't just about the dog but about the partner's consistent disregard for their boundaries. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the partner is clearly in the wrong for not communicating and manipulating. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable. Even though the dog is in a bad situation, the partner's behavior is the root issue. The author isn't being cruel by not bringing the dog home right away; they are standing up for their agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to hold the partner accountable for their actions.\n"
