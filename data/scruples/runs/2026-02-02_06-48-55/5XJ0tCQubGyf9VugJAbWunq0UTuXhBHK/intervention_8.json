I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner. The author is upset because this pattern of behavior has happened multiple times, and they feel manipulated. The key points here are the repeated actions of the partner adopting dogs without discussion, the specific instance of a seventh dog that might have cancer, and the author's reluctance to bring it home because they don't want to feel like they lost an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The partners have been together for 11 years. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without consultation, going from 6 to 7. The author mentions that they had discussed keeping it to 2-3 dogs, but the partner kept adding more. This pattern suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries and input. The fact that the partner is friends with a foster parent who uses emotional manipulation to get the author's partner to take in more dogs compounds the issue. The author feels that each time, the partner \"wins\" by getting his way through manipulation, which is causing serious relationship strain.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they love dogs but have a limit. They can't provide adequate care for 6 dogs already, making it unsustainable. The seventh dog adds more stress, especially since it's unclear if it has cancer. The author is conflicted because they don't want the dog to suffer but also don't want to enable the partner's manipulative behavior. Their hesitation isn't about the dog's well-being but about the power dynamic in the relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf I go with A, it would mean the author is wrong. But why? The author is setting boundaries and standing their ground against repeated violations. They're trying to maintain the agreed-upon number of dogs. However, the partner's actions are about the dogs' welfare, and the author is resisting for personal reasons related to the relationship power struggle. But the author's main issue is the lack of communication and manipulation, not the dogs themselves. \n\nIf I choose B, it means the author isn't in the wrong. The author is justified in feeling their boundaries are being disrespected. The partner's pattern of behavior\u2014adopting without consultation, using emotional manipulation, and ignoring previous agreements\u2014shows a lack of consideration. The author is trying to protect the relationship by not giving in to manipulation, even if it feels harsh. The stress and impact on their quality of life (no vacations, part-time job managing dogs) are valid concerns. \n\nBut there's a nuance: the author is withholding the dog's care to avoid giving in to manipulation, but the dog's welfare is at stake. However, the root issue isn't the dog but the partner's behavior. The author's stance is more about maintaining their autonomy in the relationship. Given that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if it seems harsh. The partner is the one who's repeatedly broken agreements and acted unilaterally. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their boundaries and addressing the manipulative behavior, which is affecting the relationship negatively. The partner's actions are the main issue here.\n"
