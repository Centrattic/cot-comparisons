I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they've been in a relationship for over 11 years. Their partner has adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The author is upset because they had discussed keeping the number of dogs to 2-3 after some of the previous ones died. The partner keeps getting more dogs, especially from someone who the author thinks is emotionally manipulating him. Now, this new dog has cancer, and the author doesn't want it to come home because they feel like they lose to the partner's manipulation again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the partner's actions. Adopting a dog without discussing it with their partner seems inconsiderate, especially if they had agreed on a number. The partner is clearly not respecting the author's input. The foster parent might be manipulating him, which the author feels is a pattern. The author is frustrated because every time the partner gets a new dog, it's without their consent, and now the author is resisting bringing the dog home to avoid giving in to what they perceive as manipulation.\n\nThe author's position is that they love dogs but there's a limit. They're struggling with the emotional aspect versus their responsibility. They mention that having six dogs is already a part-time job, making vacations impossible. Now with the seventh, which has health issues, it's adding more stress. They're considering ending the relationship because of this behavior, which shows how serious the issue is for them.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for their boundaries. They had prior agreements about the number of dogs. The partner broke those agreements repeatedly. The author's hesitation isn't about the dog's well-being directly but about the partner's manipulative behavior. However, the author is also conflicted because they love dogs and don't want the dog to die. But the key point here is that the partner didn't consult them, which violates their agreement. The author is trying to maintain their boundary, even if it feels like a loss in the moment. \n\nThe partner's actions are the main issue here. The author is not wrong for wanting to enforce the boundaries they previously set. The emotional manipulation by the partner and the foster parent is a red flag. The author is trying to protect their partnership and their living situation by not giving in to the partner's unilateral decisions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their stance based on prior agreements and the partner's behavior. The partner is the one who's being inconsiderate and manipulative. The author's feelings about the dog's well-being versus their need to set boundaries is complex, but they're justified in upholding their side of the agreement.\n"
