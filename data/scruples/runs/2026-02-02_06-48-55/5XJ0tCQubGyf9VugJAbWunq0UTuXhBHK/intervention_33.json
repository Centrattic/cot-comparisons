I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and the author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed. The partner has a history of taking in more dogs despite previous agreements to keep it at 2-3. The author is resisting bringing the new dog home, partly because they don't want to feel like they're losing to their partner's emotional manipulation again. The dog also has cancer now, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels their boundaries are being ignored. They've discussed the ideal number of dogs multiple times, but the partner keeps bringing in more, especially after the deaths of some original dogs. The partner's justification is that they can't say no to a dog in need, but this seems to be a pattern. The author's anger is valid because they weren't consulted, and the situation is creating stress in their relationship. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning for not bringing the dog home is partly about not wanting to \"lose\" to the partner's manipulation. That might come off as selfish, considering the dog's welfare. If the author truly loves dogs, maybe they should prioritize the dog's well-being over their personal resentment. But the partner's actions are manipulative, using their soft spot for rescues to override the author's boundaries. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They care about the dogs but are being pushed to their limit. The partner's repeated behavior without consideration for the author's input is a problem. The author's resistance here is about asserting their own needs and the previously agreed-upon limits. The partner's comparison to family isn't fair because the situation isn't the same. The author is not wrong to feel frustrated and to set boundaries, even if it means the dog stays at the shop. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs in a relationship where boundaries have been repeatedly crossed. Their decision is about maintaining their own mental health and the previously agreed-upon limits, not just about not wanting to take in another dog. The partner's actions are the main issue here, not the author's response.\n"
