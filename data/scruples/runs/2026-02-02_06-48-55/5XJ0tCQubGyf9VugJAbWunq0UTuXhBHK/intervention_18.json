I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The background shows they've had multiple instances where the partner brought in dogs without their consent, even after agreeing on 2-3 as the ideal number. The partner has a history of being influenced by the foster parent, which the author sees as emotional manipulation. Now, the latest dog has cancer, and the author is resisting bringing it home because they feel it would give in to the partner's manipulation again.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the partner repeatedly ignores prior agreements and brings in more dogs without discussion. The author is stressed about the number of dogs and the impact on their lives. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed. The partner argues that if the author's family needed help, they'd do the same, but the author sees this as an unfair comparison. The author is considering ending the relationship due to this pattern.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is standing their ground against a partner who's consistently disregarded their input, leading to a significant number of dogs. The partner's actions are seen as manipulative and inconsiderate. The author's refusal to bring the dog home isn't about the dog's well-being but about not wanting to capitulate to manipulation. However, the dog is in a bad situation, and the author might feel conflicted.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author's main issue isn't the dog's health but the partner's pattern of behavior. They don't want to give in again, which is understandable given the history. The author is trying to set boundaries after repeated overstepping. While the partner's actions are problematic, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to uphold their boundaries, even if it means the dog's situation is less than ideal. The author's stress and the impact on their life are valid. The partner's manipulation is the root issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for resisting further manipulation. They're asserting their needs after years of being sidelined. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
