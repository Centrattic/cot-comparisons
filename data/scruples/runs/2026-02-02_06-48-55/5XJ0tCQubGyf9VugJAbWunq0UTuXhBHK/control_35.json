I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements about keeping the number of dogs lower.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The partners have been together 11 years. The partner already had six rescue dogs, four with special needs. They'd discussed multiple times that 2-3 dogs is the ideal number. But over the years, the partner kept taking in more dogs\u2014two more without telling them, then another, and now a seventh. The latest one has cancer and the author is upset because bringing it home feels like giving in to emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author's main points are about the partner acting without consultation, leading to an unsustainable number of dogs, and the emotional toll it's taking. They also mention considering ending the relationship because of this behavior. The partner argues that if family needed help, he'd help, but the author sees it as unfair comparison.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The partner's actions seem to be a pattern of disregarding previous agreements and the author's input. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is a valid thing to do. The partner's behavior is the main issue here, but the question is whether the author is also at fault. The author is not returning the dog to a shelter against the partner's wishes but is keeping it at the business. They're resisting the emotional manipulation by not giving in, which is understandable. \n\nThe key is whether the author is being unreasonable in not allowing the dog home. The author's concerns about the number of dogs and the partner's repeated behavior are valid. They've already agreed on a number, and the partner's actions are breaking that agreement. The author's refusal isn't about the dog itself but about the partner's manipulation and breaking trust. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries and the partner is the one consistently not respecting them. So the answer should be B.\n"
