I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements limiting the number of dogs to 2-3. The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind the author's back, and this latest dog has cancer. The author is reluctant to bring it home, fearing it's another victory for the partner's emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together 11 years, with the partner starting with six rescue dogs, four of which had special needs. Two died, and they agreed to keep it at 2-3 dogs. Over the past five years, the partner adopted more dogs without consulting the author. The latest is a seventh dog with health issues, adopted after emotional manipulation by a foster parent. The author is upset because bringing the dog home feels like giving in to manipulation, and they're considering ending the relationship due to this pattern.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about the agreement not being respected, the burden of having six dogs already, and the partner's manipulative behavior. They love dogs but feel overwhelmed and unconsulted. The partner justifies it by saying they can't let the dog die, and compares it to helping family, but the author finds that comparison unfair.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From the details given, the partner violated prior agreements and acted unilaterally. The author is standing their ground, which seems reasonable given the history. The partner's actions are undermining the author's needs and the mutual agreement. The author's reluctance to bring the dog home isn't about the dog but about control and respect in the relationship. The partner's behavior is manipulative, as they know the author can't say no to animals in need. The author is frustrated with this repeated pattern, which is affecting their quality of life and the relationship's health.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're defending their boundaries and the agreed-upon limits. The partner's actions are the issue here. The author's feelings are valid, especially given the long-term impact and the lack of consultation. Even though they care about the dog, it's about respecting their autonomy and the partnership. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
