A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by showing too much attention at the gym. The situation is that the author approached a woman three times. First, when she was nearby during a workout and asked her to spot. Then they had small talk once more. The third time, he caught up to her after the gym to ask for coffee. She responded that she's married and asked him to stop. Now he's feeling like a creep.\n\nSo the key points here are: the first approach was for a gym-related task (spotting), which seems reasonable and professional. The second time was a passing conversation. The third approach was more personal (coffee invite) after she had already indicated she's married. She didn't have a ring, so he didn't know. But she's clear now. \n\nThe question is whether the third approach was wrong. The author didn't know she was married, but she's asking him to stop. Even if he thought it was innocent, once she explicitly asked him to stop, continuing would be wrong. But he did stop after she told him to. However, the initial third approach might be seen as crossing a line because he was trying to start a personal invitation in a setting where people are usually there for their own workouts. Even if the first two interactions were okay, the third one may be overstepping, especially in a place where people might not want to be approached.\n\nAlso, gyms are public but often people go there to avoid social interactions. Approaching someone beyond minimal interactions can be intrusive. The author's third action, despite not knowing about the marriage, might still be considered inappropriate because it's a one-on-one personal invitation in a context where that's not expected. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the third approach was too personal and led to her discomfort, even if he didn't know about her marital status beforehand.\n"
