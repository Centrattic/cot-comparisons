A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about someone at the gym who approached a woman multiple times, and she asked him to stop. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe author mentions they approached her three times. The first time was when she was nearby during a bench press, so they asked to spot her. That seems like a normal gym interaction, maybe even appropriate since it's a functional request. Then they had small talk once more. After that, the third time they caught up to her and asked for coffee. The woman responded by saying she's married and wants him to stop. \n\nNow, the key points here are how many times he approached her and how she responded. Even though they had two prior interactions, the third approach was a direct invitation to coffee, which is more of a personal or romantic overture. She made it clear she was married and didn't want further contact. So the author continued after that, which is problematic.\n\nThe main issue is respecting boundaries. The woman clearly communicated her discomfort, so the author should have stopped. The fact that she didn't wear a ring isn't an excuse; people might be married without visible signs, and it's up to the initiator to be respectful. The author's actions after her first two polite interactions and then a direct ask might be seen as crossing a line, especially when she explicitly told him to stop.\n\nAlso, the author is now feeling nervous about going to the gym, which indicates some regret. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since the woman asked to stop, and the author persisted, that's the key. In social situations, if someone says no or asks to stop, continuing is considered wrong. So the answer here is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
