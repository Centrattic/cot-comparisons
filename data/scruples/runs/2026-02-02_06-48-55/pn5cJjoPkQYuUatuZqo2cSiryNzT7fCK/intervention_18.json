A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by approaching a woman at the gym multiple times, leading to her asking him to stop.\n\nFirst, the author approached her once to ask for a spot during a workout, which seems reasonable and context-appropriate. They had a brief conversation and occasional smiles afterward. Then, the third time, he asked her out, not knowing she was married. She clearly told him to stop, and he realized he was being creepy. \n\nThe key points here are: initial interaction was friendly and relevant (spotting), followed by a few more interactions. But the third approach was when she expressed not wanting contact. The author didn't know about her marriage, but she didn't wear a ring, so that's understandable. However, she explicitly told him to stop, so he should have respected that immediately. \n\nThe problem is that even if the first two interactions were okay, the third time was when she showed disinterest. The author continued after being told to stop, which is the issue. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't heed her boundaries after she asked to be left alone. The answer should be A.\n"
