A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about approaching a woman at the gym multiple times, and she ended up telling him to stop because she's married.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author mentions he's been at the gym for three years. He noticed a woman he found attractive and approached her once to ask for a spot while benching, which started some small talk. Then they spoke once more in passing. Later, he caught up to her and asked her for coffee. She said she's married and asked him to stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's actions were inappropriate. Let's consider the norms around social interactions, especially in gym settings. Gyms are typically places where people are focused on their workouts, so unsolicited attention can be a problem. The first approach was to ask for a spot, which is a common gym interaction and seems reasonable. However, the second time he approached her to ask for coffee. She responded negatively, stating she's married and wants him to stop. \n\nHere's the key point: after she told him to stop, he continued the conversation, which might not be the case. Wait, the story says he asked her for coffee, and she told him to stop. The author replied that they had spoken twice before and just exchanged glances, then she said \"please stop.\" So after she told him to stop, he might have acknowledged that. However, the problem is that he initiated the third approach, which she found creepy. \n\nBut wait, the initial approaches: asking for a spot is a valid reason. Then one more time in passing. Then the third time, he asks her out. The issue is whether that third approach was appropriate. Also, she was married, which he didn't know. But she didn't have a ring, so he couldn't have known. However, in general, approaching someone in a gym setting can be a gray area. \n\nIn social contexts, initiating contact once is okay. Doing it a couple of times might be okay if there's mutual interest. But if someone is married, even if they don't show it, approaching them for a date is crossing a line. The woman felt uncomfortable and asked him to stop, which the author then respected. However, the initial third approach is the main issue here. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't know she was married, but he did approach her for a personal invitation. Even if she didn't indicate being married, approaching a married person for a date is generally considered inappropriate. The woman felt it was creepy, which makes sense because she's in a committed relationship. \n\nBut the author didn't know her marital status. So is he at fault for not knowing? Or is the fault in approaching her for a date after a minimal interaction? The line between friendly conversation and overstepping can be thin. Since she responded negatively and he stopped, maybe he's not the asshole, but there's a case that he overstepped by asking her out after a couple of interactions. \n\nHowever, the woman's response was to tell him to stop and that she's married. The author's actions were based on what he perceived as possible interest. The key is that he didn't know her marital status. So maybe he isn't entirely at fault. But in general, approaching someone in a public place like a gym with the intent to ask them out after only a few interactions can be seen as intrusive. \n\nBut the woman's response was to tell him to stop, which he then did. So maybe the main issue is that he approached her for a date, which she found inappropriate. However, the author didn't know she was married. So it's a bit of a tricky case. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally okay to talk to someone at the gym if there's mutual interaction. But asking for a date after minimal interaction could be seen as moving too fast. The fact that she was married adds another layer, but the author had no way of knowing. However, the woman's reaction suggests that she felt harassed. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a line by asking her out after a couple of interactions, especially in a place where people expect to focus on their workout. Even though he didn't know she was married, the approach itself was perhaps too forward. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for initiating the third approach, leading to her feeling uncomfortable. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
