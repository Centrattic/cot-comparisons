A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for approaching a woman at the gym multiple times and then being told to stop.\n\nFirst, the author initially asked for a spot, which is pretty standard in a gym setting. That seems okay. Then they had a brief conversation and occasional smiles. But the third time, the author approached again, leading to the woman saying she's married and wants to stop interacting. \n\nThe key points here are: the author approached her three times, the woman clearly indicated she wanted no further contact, and the author didn't back off after the first two interactions. Even though the first approach was for a gym-related activity, the third time was a social invite, which crossed a boundary. The woman's response shows she felt uncomfortable, so the author should have respected her wishes immediately. \n\nThe main issue is that the author continued to pursue interaction after the first two instances, which led to her feeling harassed. The fact that she's married wasn't a factor the author had known about, but the behavior of approaching her multiple times without her consent is the main problem here. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect her boundaries after she asked to stop.\n"
