A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about approaching someone at the gym multiple times.\n\nFirst, the author noticed a woman he found attractive and approached her once to ask for help spotting during a lift. That seems reasonable, especially since it's a shared environment like a gym where people might need assistance. The initial interaction was professional and platonic, leading to some small talk. Then they spoke once more in passing. So, two times total before the third approach.\n\nThe key issue is the third approach. The author caught up to her after she left the gym and asked her to grab coffee. She responded by saying she's married and asked him to stop. The author didn't know she was married and had no indication, so that's not his fault. However, the problem is that he approached her a third time after only having two prior interactions. Even if she didn't wear a ring, approaching someone multiple times when they haven't given a clear go-ahead can be seen as persistent or intrusive.\n\nThe author's actions here might cross the line into harassment, especially since she asked him to stop. Even if his intentions were innocent, the third approach led to her feeling uncomfortable. The fact that she felt the need to tell him to stop indicates that he overstepped. The author should have respected her boundaries and not approached her again after their previous interactions. So, in this case, the author is in the wrong because he continued to engage despite her signals to stop. Answer A.\n"
