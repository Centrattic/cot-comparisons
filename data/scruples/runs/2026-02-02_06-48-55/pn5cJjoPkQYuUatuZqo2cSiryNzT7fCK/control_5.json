A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone at the gym approaching a woman multiple times, and she ended up telling them to stop because she's married.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been to the gym for three years and usually avoid approaching women there because they don't want to be annoying. That's a good point. They made an effort not to be intrusive, which is positive. But then they asked to spot her once, which is a normal gym interaction when someone is benching. That's a common practice, so probably okay.\n\nShe responded and they had small talk. Then later, another passing conversation. So two interactions. The third time, when she was leaving, he caught up and asked for coffee. She said she's married and told him to stop. The key here is that he approached her a third time, even though prior interactions were minimal and she didn't respond positively. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether asking for coffee after two brief interactions is too much. In social settings, especially in places like a gym where people are focused on their work out, approaching someone multiple times can be seen as persistent. Even if the first time was about spotting, which is a legitimate request, the second and third times might not be. The woman felt uncomfortable enough to explicitly tell him to stop, which means he crossed a line.\n\nHe didn't notice her wedding ring, but that's not a valid excuse. People might choose not to wear one, or it could be a recent marriage. But the problem isn't just about the ring; it's about respecting her boundaries. Since she told him to stop after the third approach, he should have respected that immediately. Continuing to talk or show interest after being told to stop is definitely inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's now nervous to go to the gym suggests that his actions made her uncomfortable, which he should have recognized. The woman's clear communication that she preferred to stop the interaction and that she's married means he should back off. Repeated approaches without clear mutual interest can be perceived as harassment, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he approached her more than she was comfortable with, especially after she had already indicated she wanted to cut off contact. The correct answer is A.\n"
