A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about approaching a woman at the gym multiple times, and she ended up telling him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author noticed the woman a few months ago, asked her to spot during a workout, which was a common gym interaction. Then they talked once more, and had occasional eye contact. Then the third time, he asked her out to coffee, and she said she's married and wants him to stop. The author is now feeling like a creep and unsure if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. My job is to decide A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nIn most social contexts, approaching someone once isn't necessarily wrong. The first time was a request for a spot, which is standard. The second time was passing conversation. The third time, the author asked her out. The key point here is that she was married and didn't wear a ring. The author didn't know that, but she made it clear to stop after he asked. \n\nThe issue here is that the author didn't realize she had boundaries. Even though the first two interactions were brief, the third was a direct approach. In a gym setting, people often avoid personal interactions to respect others' space. The author might have crossed a line by escalating from a professional request to a personal invitation without reading the signs. The woman's response indicates she wasn't interested in further interaction. The author's actions could be seen as persistent, even if not intentionally creepy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was married and he didn't know about it isn't an excuse. The problem is that he continued to approach her beyond the initial interactions. If someone says they prefer you to stop, it's a clear signal to back off. The author should have respected that, even if they felt they were just being friendly. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author did overstep by the third approach. The answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
