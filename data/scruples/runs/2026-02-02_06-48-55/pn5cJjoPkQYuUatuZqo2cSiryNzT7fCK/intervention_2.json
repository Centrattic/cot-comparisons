A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author started talking to a woman at the gym. The first time was asking for a spot while benching, which is pretty common in gyms. Then they had some small talk and occasional smiles. Then the third time, the author asked her to coffee, and she responded that she's married and told him to stop. Now he's feeling creepy and unsure if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, where's the line here? The first interaction was probably okay\u2014asking for a spot is normal. Then they talked once more in passing and smiled occasionally. But the third time, asking her out after only two interactions might be too much. Especially since she was married and he didn't know that. She gave him clear boundaries by saying to stop. So the issue is whether he overstepped by approaching her a third time.\n\nThe key points are consent and respecting boundaries. Even if the first interactions were friendly, the third approach might have been unwelcome. She felt uncomfortable enough to tell him to stop. The author should have recognized that after the first couple of times and not pursued further. Also, since they didn't really get to know each other, it's possible he was being too forward. So yeah, he did cross a line by not respecting her boundary when she told him to stop. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
