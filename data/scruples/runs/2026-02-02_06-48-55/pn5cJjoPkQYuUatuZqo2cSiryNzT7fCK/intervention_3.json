A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he approached a woman at the gym. They had a few interactions, and then he asked her out, not knowing she was married. She told him to stop, and he's feeling like a creep now.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The initial interaction was when he asked her to spot him during a bench press. That seems pretty standard in a gym setting, especially if she's nearby. Then they had small talk once. They occasionally smiled and made eye contact. So up until that point, it's maybe just friendly interactions. \n\nBut then the third time, he catches her leaving and asks her for coffee. She responds that she's married and wants him to stop talking to her. Now, the key points here are: he approached her a third time without prior indication that she wanted more contact. He didn't know she was married, but that's not an excuse for approaching her again after she didn't show interest. \n\nWait, but did she show disinterest before? The story says they talked once before, and had occasional glances. Maybe he misread the signals. If she didn't initiate further conversations or show enthusiasm, maybe he overstepped. Also, even if she didn't have a ring, assuming someone isn't married just because they don't wear a ring is part of the problem. But the main issue is that he approached her again after two interactions, which might not be a lot, but when she didn't reciprocate beyond that, he persisted.\n\nThe key here is respecting boundaries. If she told him to stop, then clearly he went too far. Even if the previous interactions were friendly, the third approach was the problem. The fact that she was married is an added reason why it's inappropriate, but the main issue is that he continued to engage without her consent or interest. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't heed her clear request to stop and made her uncomfortable. The answer is A.\n"
