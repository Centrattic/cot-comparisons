A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about approaching someone at the gym multiple times, leading to the woman being uncomfortable because she's married.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author approached her once to ask for a spot, which seems reasonable. Then they had small talk once more. Then, a third time, he asked her out after she left the gym. She told him she's married and wants him to stop. He's now feeling like a creep and is nervous to go to the gym.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the third approach was wrong. The author didn't know she was married, but she didn't have a ring. The problem is that after two previous interactions, he tried to approach her a third time. Even if the first two were casual, the third time might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially after she expressed discomfort.\n\nThe woman's reaction is clear: she told him to stop. That means he should have respected her wishes immediately. The fact that he approached her again after she said no would definitely be inconsiderate. Even if the first two interactions were innocent, the third was after she indicated she didn't want further contact. So, the author is in the wrong here because he didn't heed her clear message and continued to make her uncomfortable. The answer should be A.\n"
