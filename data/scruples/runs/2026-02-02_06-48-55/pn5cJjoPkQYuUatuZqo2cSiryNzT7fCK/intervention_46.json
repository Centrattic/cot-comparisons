A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after approaching a woman at the gym multiple times. \n\nFirst, the author initially asked the woman to spot him during a workout, which seems reasonable because that's a common gym interaction. They had small talk once more. Then, they occasionally exchanged glances and smiled. Up to this point, there's no indication of a problem. \n\nThe issue arises when the author approaches her a third time to ask for coffee. The woman responds by stating she's married and asks him to stop. The key here is that she clearly communicated her discomfort. The author claims they only spoke twice before, but the woman's reaction suggests that even those interactions might have been more than she was comfortable with. \n\nThe author's actions after being told to stop are important. He should have respected her request immediately. Feeling creeped out and being nervous at the gym now is a consequence of his actions. \n\nAlso, the fact that the woman was married is a significant factor. Even if there was no ring, the author should have been aware that pursuing her was inappropriate. The woman's request to stop should be taken seriously, and continuing to approach her would be wrong. \n\nIn social situations, respecting boundaries is crucial. The author overstepped by making a third approach and didn't stop when asked. Even if the initial interactions were innocent, the final act of asking her out after being told to stop makes him in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
