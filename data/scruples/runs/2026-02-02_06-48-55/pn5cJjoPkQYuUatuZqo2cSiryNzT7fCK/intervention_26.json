A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about approaching a woman at the gym.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they approached the woman three times. The first time was when asking to spot during a workout, which was probably acceptable because it's a common gym interaction. Then they had a brief conversation, and later, the author asked her out for coffee. The woman responded by saying she's married and asked him to stop talking to her.\n\nThe key point here is that the woman was married, and the author wasn't aware. However, the author approached her a third time after only two prior interactions. Even if the first two were brief, the third approach might be seen as crossing a line. The woman clearly set a boundary by asking him to stop, so the author should respect that.\n\nAlso, the author admits to feeling nervous about going to the gym now, which suggests that the woman felt uncomfortable. The fact that she didn't wear a ring doesn't excuse the author from respecting her boundaries once she communicated them. Approaching someone multiple times without clear interest can be seen as persistent and potentially creepy, especially in a shared space like a gym where people expect to be left alone.\n\nSo, considering the woman's request to stop and the author's continued approach, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
