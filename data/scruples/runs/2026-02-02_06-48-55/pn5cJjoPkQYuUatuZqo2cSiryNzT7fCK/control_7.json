A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for approaching the woman at the gym multiple times after she said to stop. The situation involves the man initially asking for a spot during a workout, then talking once more, and then asking her for coffee, which she refused because she's married. She told him to stop, and now he's feeling awkward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. The woman was clear that she wanted him to stop talking to her. When someone says \"no\" or \"please stop,\" it's important to respect that boundary. Approaching her a third time after she's already indicated she's not interested could be seen as crossing a line. Even if their interactions were limited, continuing after a rejection might be considered persistent or unwanted attention.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's married adds another layer. The man didn't know she was married, but once she told him, he still proceeded to ask her out. That might come off as insensitive, especially if he wasn't aware of her marital status beforehand. However, the issue here isn't just about knowing she's married but about respecting her boundaries after she asked him to stop.\n\nThe man's actions after her initial refusal are key. He tried to justify it by saying they only spoke twice and exchanged glances. But the woman didn't give any indication that those interactions were okay. In social situations, especially in places like gyms where people might want to avoid harassment, it's important to take a step back once someone isn't interested.\n\nAnother angle is the woman's reaction. She felt the need to be explicit, which suggests she wasn't okay with further interactions. The man's continued attempt to talk to her after her clear request to stop could be seen as not taking her seriously, which is a problem. Even if there was no malicious intent, persistence in the face of rejection can make someone feel creeped out.\n\nI should also think about the context of the gym. People often go there for privacy and focus on their workout. The man's actions might have made her uncomfortable, leading to her request to stop. His subsequent behavior after the refusal is what's under scrutiny here. The key point is respecting her boundaries once she's communicated them.\n\nIn conclusion, the man approached her a third time despite her direct request to stop. That persistence, even if it started with a simple question, is likely to be seen as inappropriate. The woman's response, feeling like he's creepy and her asking to stop, indicates that he overstepped. So the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
