A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for showing too much attention to a woman at the gym.\n\nFirst, the guy approached her once to ask for a spot while benching, which seems reasonable and context-appropriate at the gym. Then they had a brief interaction and a second time in passing. So far, maybe that's okay, but then he approached her a third time to invite her to coffee. She then told him she's married and asked him to stop. \n\nThe key points here are: he approached her multiple times after initial interactions. Even though the first two interactions were brief and work-out related, the third approach was more direct and personal. She clearly set a boundary by telling him to stop. \n\nIn social situations, especially in shared spaces like a gym, it's important to respect people's personal space and boundaries. The woman made it clear she didn't want further interaction, so continuing to engage after that could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that she's married and he didn't know that doesn't excuse the behavior; the main issue is respecting her boundaries once communicated.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was approaching her a third time after she had already indicated through their previous interactions that she wasn't interested in further conversation. The final interaction led to her explicitly telling him to stop, which he should have respected immediately. His actions after that point were likely making her uncomfortable, hence the \"creepy\" feeling she expressed.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he continued to pursue interaction after she had clearly asked him to stop. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
