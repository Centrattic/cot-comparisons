A few months ago I noticed a woman that I thought was extremely attractive. I\u2019ve always been good about not approaching or talking to women in the gym because we are all there to better ourselves and not be annoyed by people. \n\nWell one day I was benching and she was literally the closest person next to me and I asked if she would spot me. Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn\u2019t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I\u2019m a creepy asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about approaching someone at the gym multiple times.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they didn't approach women at the gym before, respecting everyone's space. They asked the woman to spot them once, which led to small talk. Then they talked once more. After that, they approached her again to invite her to coffee. The woman was married and didn't wear a ring, so the author wasn't aware. She told him to stop, which made him feel creepy.\n\nNow, the key points here are boundaries and respecting the other person's comfort. The author approached her three times. The first two times were in the context of the gym (spotting and passing by), which might be considered acceptable in some gym cultures. However, the third approach was to invite her out, which she clearly rejected. The woman's response\u2014saying she's married and asking him to stop\u2014should be a clear signal to back off immediately.\n\nEven though the author tried to justify it by saying they only spoke twice, the woman felt uncomfortable. The main issue here is that the author didn't recognize her discomfort until she explicitly told him. In social interactions, respecting the other's wishes is crucial. The author continued after the initial interactions without considering that she might not be interested beyond a friend level. Plus, approaching her a third time after she indicated she's married and wants to stop the conversation is crossing a boundary.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't heed the woman's clear rejection and made her uncomfortable. The answer should be A.\n"
