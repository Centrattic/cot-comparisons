Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling her partner, who then kicked her out of the apartment. The apartment is paid for by the partner, and they've been in a 3-year relationship where trust is important because both have been cheated on before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The apartment is his, and she's not paying for it. If she leaves, he's not obligated to keep the apartment, but she's been living there. The argument started because she wanted to go on a trip he didn't agree with, and he told her to leave. The key points here are communication, consent in the relationship, and the living situation.\n\nHe mentions they were big on trust and communication. If she planned this trip for months without telling him, that's a problem. However, the way he responded by kicking her out might be harsh. Even though he pays for the apartment, relationships involve mutual respect. Ending the relationship because of a disagreement, especially over a planned trip, could be seen as a strong reaction. Maybe he should have discussed it more, tried to reach a compromise, or considered her need for independence. But then again, if he felt it was a breach of trust or a deal-breaker, maybe it's his right to end things.\n\nAnother angle: the apartment is his, so if she's not a co-owner, he can ask her to leave. But if they were in a committed relationship, they might have expectations of staying together, and sudden eviction without a clear alternative (like the hotel offer he mentioned) could be problematic. Also, the people calling him a controlling asshole might have a point if he didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve the issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, breaking up over a disagreement isn't inherently wrong, but the method of doing so by immediately evicting her might be harsh. If the issue was the lack of communication about the trip, then the breakup is a result of a deal-breaker for him. However, if she didn't realize the trip would be a problem, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how relationships handle such issues. In some views, it's his right to end the relationship, but in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" maybe not, but others might think he could have handled it more compassionately. I'm leaning towards B (No), but need to check if there's a legal aspect with the apartment. Since she's not a tenant, he can ask her to leave, but emotionally, maybe it's a different story. Still, the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral judgment. So maybe AITA forums often consider communication and intentions. If he felt it was a deal-breaker and she didn't communicate, then maybe not wrong. But the immediate eviction could be seen as harsh. Hmm, maybe A for wrong? Or B? I think it's a toss-up, but leaning towards B because he's handling his own boundaries, even if it's harsh.\n"
