Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling her boyfriend, who pays for their apartment. He found out and then kicked her out, saying she could leave since she wasn't paying for the apartment. People are calling him a controlling asshole, but he thinks he's right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their living arrangement. He pays for the apartment, she compensates for her share through utilities and other expenses. They both value trust, which is important because they've both been cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. She didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't let her go. The argument led to him telling her to leave since she didn't pay for the apartment, and she went to her parents' house.\n\nNow, the key points here. The apartment is in his name and he pays for it, so legally she doesn't have a right to stay there. If they're in a committed relationship, sharing an apartment, it's expected that both have a say in major life decisions, especially if it affects their shared living situation. However, she had been planning this trip for months and didn't inform him until 5 days before leaving. That seems like a big oversight. \n\nHe reacted by kicking her out, which might be seen as extreme. Even though he's the one paying, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. If she wanted to travel, maybe they should have discussed it earlier. But he didn't give her the choice to stay or leave; he forced her to leave. Also, he offered money for a hotel, which she refused. But if she was going on a trip, staying in a hotel would cost her money, which might not be feasible if she's planning a backpacking trip. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have felt betrayed or that she wasn't being honest about her plans. They had been in a relationship for 3 years, and trust was a big part of their relationship. Her not telling him about the trip could be seen as a breach of that trust. However, she did mention she was planning it for months but didn't inform him because she thought he would object. That seems like a problem in communication. \n\nBut reacting by kicking her out immediately might be over the top. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, she's his girlfriend, and such a decision affects both of them. He could have discussed it, tried to reach a compromise, or set boundaries without immediately ending the relationship. Also, the fact that people are calling him a controlling asshole might be because forcing someone to leave the home they share, even if you pay for it, can come off as controlling. \n\nIn some cases, if someone moves out voluntarily, there's no need to kick them out. But the way he phrased it, making her leave because she didn't pay for the apartment, might seem like using financial control over her. Relationships require partnership, and even if he's paying for the apartment, it's a shared space. His reaction might be seen as using financial power to control the relationship. \n\nSo putting it all together, maybe the author is in the wrong. He should have handled the situation differently, maybe communicating better instead of immediately forcing her to leave. Even though she didn't pay for the apartment, the way he reacted could be seen as controlling and not respecting the relationship's dynamics. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
