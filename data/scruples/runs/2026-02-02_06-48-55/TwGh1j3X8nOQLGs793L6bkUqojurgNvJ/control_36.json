Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been living together for three years. He pays for the apartment entirely, and she covers her part through a meter. They value trust a lot because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and when he found out, they argued, and he told her to leave the apartment. She went to her parents' house, and now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points: He pays for the apartment, she doesn't. She didn't inform him about the trip, which was a big deal because it's a solo trip and she thought he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to him telling her to leave. \n\nNow, considering the setup of their living arrangement. He's the one paying for the apartment, so legally, if they're not married, he's the one who owns the lease. So, if she's not a tenant, he can ask her to leave. But they were in a relationship, so there's an emotional aspect here too. \n\nThe girlfriend didn't communicate about the trip, which could be a problem in a relationship. They were big on trust and communication, so her not telling him might be a breach of that. But then again, she might have felt he would be against it. However, not discussing major life decisions like a solo trip that affects their shared living situation could be seen as a mistake.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her to leave the apartment. Since he's paying for it, he has a right to do that, but in a relationship, such a decision is usually discussed. However, the girlfriend didn't pay for the apartment, so she might not have the same rights. But the question is about being in the wrong emotionally, not legally. \n\nIf they were in a healthy relationship, communication would be key. She should have discussed the trip with him, and he should have considered her feelings. However, the fact that he immediately told her to leave, possibly without considering alternative solutions, might be seen as harsh. But the context is that they value trust and had issues with past cheating. So, maybe the lack of communication from her was a bigger issue. \n\nAlso, he offered money for a hotel, which she refused. That shows he was trying to be reasonable. However, kicking her out during an argument might be impulsive. But given their living situation, if he's the sole tenant, he can ask her to leave. \n\nSo, from a relationship ethics standpoint, both could have handled it better. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he was paying for the apartment and she didn't communicate the trip, and he's choosing to end the relationship by removing her from the apartment, maybe he's justified. But if the problem was the lack of communication from her, then perhaps both are at fault. However, the author's action might be seen as extreme, but given the context of trust and her not telling him about a major decision, maybe it's a mutual issue. \n\nIn the AITA context, usually, the person who made the unilateral decision without considering the other's feelings might be in the wrong. However, in this case, the girlfriend didn't communicate, and the author, who was paying for the apartment, had the right to ask her to leave. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
