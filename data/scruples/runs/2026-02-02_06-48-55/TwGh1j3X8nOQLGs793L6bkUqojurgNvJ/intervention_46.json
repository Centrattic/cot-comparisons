Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she took an unannounced solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for, and they value mutual trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip, which the author found unacceptable. When she said she was going anyway, he told her to leave the house, and she did, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip until 5 days before, even though she had been planning it for months. She thought he wouldn't support her going alone. The author felt betrayed because he was the one paying for the apartment and expected trust and transparency. \n\nIn relationships, especially when cohabiting, communication is crucial. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip earlier, considering their emphasis on trust. However, the author's response of telling her to leave the house seems extreme. Ending the relationship over this, without trying to work through the issue, might be seen as harsh. \n\nThe author might feel he's justified because she didn't communicate, but throwing her out without considering her perspective (like her need for personal growth) could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, if they had clear boundaries about living arrangements and finances, maybe he's within his rights. But the emotional reaction and the sudden breakup might make him the asshole. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the girlfriend made a mistake by not communicating, his response was disproportionate. Instead of a breakup, a discussion about their relationship's boundaries would have been more appropriate. The act of kicking her out immediately and ending the relationship over this seems too harsh, especially after three years. So, the author's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of hurt, are more in the wrong.\n"
