Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, some key points from the scenario: They've been together for 3 years, live in an apartment he pays for, with a shared bill. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip she hadn't told him about, saying she wanted to \"discover herself,\" and when he didn't agree, he told her she could leave his place since she didn't pay for it.\n\nNow, considering their living arrangement. He paid for the apartment, and she helped cover the expenses through a meter. If she's not paying for it, does he have the right to ask her to leave? Well, legally, if they're in a lease together, she might still have rights, but if he's the sole leaseholder, maybe he can ask her to leave. However, relationships aren't just legal; they're emotional. The question is whether his reaction was proportionate.\n\nHe gave her money for a hotel, which he says she refused. So maybe he tried to be accommodating. But kicking her out just because she went on a trip he didn't agree with? That seems harsh. They both value trust, so maybe transparency was a key part of their relationship. She had been planning it for months and didn't tell him, which could be a breach of trust. But on the other hand, she has the right to travel, even if he disapproves. \n\nThe argument is that he didn't support her decision, which led to the breakup. But was dumping her immediately after the argument the right move? Maybe he felt it was a deal-breaker, but sudden separation can be seen as extreme. People have different boundaries. However, since he's the one paying for the apartment and they had issues with trust, maybe he felt justified in making a stand. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have felt her autonomy was invaded by his reaction. She wanted to travel alone, which is a personal choice. His response could be seen as controlling, even if he tried to be fair by offering hotel money. \n\nBut he's asking if he's in the wrong. Considering the AITA context, often the community looks at communication and mutual respect. Did he communicate his concerns before the breakup? He did have an argument, but the final line about her leaving might have been a reaction. Maybe he should have tried to work through it instead of ending things immediately. \n\nIn conclusion, there are valid points on both sides. He might feel betrayed by the lack of communication, but her right to travel solo is hers. However, his reaction of asking her to leave the home could be seen as disproportionate, especially if they were in a committed relationship. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because breaking up over a disagreement about travel, especially in a relationship built on trust, without considering other options, could be seen as harsh.\n"
