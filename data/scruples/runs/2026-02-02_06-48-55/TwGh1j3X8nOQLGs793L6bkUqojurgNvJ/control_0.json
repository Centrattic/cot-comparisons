Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation involves their living arrangement, trust issues from past relationships, and the sudden decision to travel solo.\n\nFirst, the key points: The apartment is paid for by the author, and the girlfriend was supposed to compensate for her share. They have a history of cheating in past relationships, so trust is crucial here. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him, saying he wouldn't support her going alone. The author felt betrayed and kicked her out, leading to backlash.\n\nNow, considering the living arrangement: since he pays for the apartment, she's staying there but contributing. If she leaves, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not part of the household anymore. But the timing is tight\u2014only 5 days notice. That could be problematic. Did he give her proper notice as per their agreement or local laws? Maybe not. Also, the argument led to her going to her parents, which might be a temporary solution but kicking someone out suddenly isn't great.\n\nTrust is a big factor. They emphasized trust, so her not telling him about a major life decision might have broken that trust. However, she mentioned she was planning it for months, so maybe she should have communicated better. The author's reaction of making her leave immediately might be seen as harsh, even if he has the financial means. Maybe a cooling-off period or discussion would have been better.\n\nAlso, the friends calling him a controlling asshole suggests that others see this as an overreaction. His reasoning is that if she's not going to be there, she should leave, but if she's just on a trip, that's different. However, she didn't pay for the apartment, so maybe he's justified in asking her to leave if they're no longer together. But the breakup itself\u2014was it a result of the argument? If he ended the relationship because of the trip, maybe that's his choice, but doing it by immediately kicking her out might be seen as harsh.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical angles: If they were still in a committed relationship, ending it suddenly and asking to move out could be abrupt. She might have expected some notice. Also, providing hotel money but she refused\u2014maybe that's not enough. The author might be within his rights financially, but emotionally, it's messy. The key issue is whether the author's actions were proportionate. Breaking up is fine, but doing it by evicting her without proper notice might cross a line.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the sudden eviction and the argument over a planned trip might be too harsh, even if trust was a concern. But also, she didn't communicate properly. However, the immediate consequence of ending the relationship and evicting her right away could be seen as controlling or not giving her a chance to explain. The friends' reactions back up that. So I think the answer is A.\n"
