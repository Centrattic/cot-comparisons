Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend told him about a solo backpacking trip she planned without telling him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They've been in a 3-year relationship, and they live in an apartment where the author pays the full rent. They share a room meter and split the bill through his account. He didn't make her pay directly because he didn't want to burden her, and she helps with other expenses. The relationship is built on trust because both have been cheated on before.\n\nThe key point here is the unannounced trip. She planned it for months and told him only 5 days before departure. He didn't know until then. She said he wouldn't have let her go alone. The author's reaction was to tell her she could leave without him, and she did, going to her parents' house. He's now being called controlling, but he thinks his response was justified because he pays for the apartment and didn't want to be accommodating if she didn't inform him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, communication is a big factor in relationships. She didn't tell him about something significant that affects their future together. But he's also in a position where he's the one paying for the apartment, so maybe he felt it's his decision. However, ending the relationship by kicking her out because she did something he didn't agree with might be seen as harsh. Trust and communication were supposed to be important, so keeping such a big secret could have been a breach of that. But his response involved making her leave, which some might see as overly extreme. \n\nHe might have a valid point about the financial responsibility and her decision to go solo without discussing it. But the way he handled it\u2014ending the relationship abruptly during an argument\u2014could be where he's in the wrong. Maybe he should have discussed his concerns more calmly instead of using the argument to push her out. Also, considering her reasons for the trip (personal growth), it's a common desire and not inherently wrong. The fact that they had a history of valuing trust means that transparency should be expected. However, his reaction might come off as controlling, even if he wasn't pressuring her financially. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication from her side, but the author's response was to dump her immediately. That could be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing it and setting boundaries. But if they had always been open and she kept this a secret, it's a significant problem. The answer might hinge on whether ending the relationship was the appropriate response to her lack of communication. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the abruptness and the way he handled it, even though her secret trip was a problem. The relationship's foundation on trust suggests that her keeping such a big secret is bad, but his reaction could be seen as extreme and controlling, which might invalidate the trust he was trying to build. \n\nBut others might argue that since he's the one paying for the apartment and they have open communication, her secret trip broke that trust, giving him the right to ask her to leave. However, the term \"controlling\" is a strong one, and his response of immediately making her leave might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nHmm, this is a tough one. I think the answer is A because his reaction could be viewed as harsh and controlling, even if her actions were a breach of trust. Ending the relationship in that manner without a prior discussion might be seen as the wrong approach.\n"
