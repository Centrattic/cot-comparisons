Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending the relationship after their girlfriend went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, some context: The couple lived in a 2-bedroom apartment where the author paid all the bills. They had a history of cheating in past relationships, so trust was important. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, didn't tell them until right before, and the author kicked her out, leading to backlash from friends.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author mentions they had always been open about their lives and future plans. If the girlfriend had discussed the trip earlier, maybe there could have been a compromise. But she decided to go alone and didn't inform him until last minute, which the author saw as a breach of trust, especially since they lived together. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship and kick her out, which is a big step. However, since the apartment is his and she wasn't contributing financially, he might feel her decision impacts his living situation. But the main issue is the lack of communication from her. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, major decisions like a solo trip that affects the living arrangement should be discussed. The girlfriend's secrecy could be seen as a violation of trust. The author's response, while harsh, might be justified if he felt the trust was broken. However, ending the relationship immediately without discussion might be seen as extreme. \n\nBut considering the context of past cheating and the importance of trust, the author might believe that the lack of communication was a deal-breaker. So, whether it's right or not depends on whether the girlfriend's actions were a breach of agreed-upon trust. If they had always communicated openly, her sudden decision would be a problem. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because he acted based on the broken trust, even if the method was abrupt. But others might argue that kicking her out was too harsh. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Given the emphasis on trust and her not informing him despite knowing the importance of trust, he might not be the one in the wrong.\n"
