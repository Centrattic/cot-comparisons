Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip. First, I need to consider the context provided.\n\nThe couple lived in an apartment the author paid for. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which the author didn't know about until a few days before. The author felt betrayed because they had agreed on transparency and trust, especially given their past issues with infidelity. The argument led to the author telling her to leave the house. \n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the trip was unannounced, and the author felt it violated their trust. On the other hand, the girlfriend wasn't in the wrong for planning something personal without discussing it, especially since she's allowed to travel. The author's response was cutting her off from the home he paid for, which might be seen as harsh. However, he did offer to help with accommodation, which shows some consideration. \n\nBut using the threat of eviction during an argument could be impulsive. While the author has the right to his living space, the way he handled it might be seen as controlling. The key points are the breach of trust versus the right to personal freedom. The girlfriend had her reasons, but the author's reaction might have been too extreme. However, considering their agreement on transparency, the unannounced trip could be a valid issue. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the trip was a personal choice versus a breach of their trust agreement. If the girlfriend didn't communicate due to anticipating resistance, maybe she's partially at fault. But the author's response of evicting her seems excessive. However, he's not in the wrong entirely because he had the right to set boundaries. It's a nuanced situation, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the reaction was disproportionately harsh, even if the initial issue was a breach of trust. But maybe not. Maybe the author is justified if the trust was a mutual agreement. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The answer might be A or B. But given that the author used the eviction as a punitive measure during a disagreement, that's a red flag. So, A for in the wrong.\n"
