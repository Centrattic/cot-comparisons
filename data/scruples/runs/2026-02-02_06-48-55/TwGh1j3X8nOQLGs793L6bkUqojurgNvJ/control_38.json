Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America and told the author just days before she was leaving. The author kicked her out of their apartment, which he pays for entirely. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their living arrangement. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend contributes by covering her share through a meter. The apartment is a two-bedroom, which probably means they each have their own rooms. Since he's the one paying, maybe he feels he has more control over who stays there. But they were in a 3-year relationship, so it's not like she was just a tenant who could be tossed out without notice.\n\nThe girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip she had planned for months. She told the author she thought he wouldn't approve, so she didn't mention it. That could be seen as a breach of trust since they value trust a lot in their relationship. But on the other hand, the author didn't give her notice about the living situation either. He just kicked her out when she announced the trip, which might be abrupt.\n\nNow, the argument that happened. The author says he told her she could leave if she wanted to live her life without him. The girlfriend went to her parents' house an hour away. But since the apartment is his, maybe he has the right to ask her to leave if they're breaking up. However, doing it so suddenly without a plan for her might be harsh. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused, but maybe the immediate eviction was too much.\n\nTrust was a big part of their relationship. She didn't tell him about the trip because she thought he'd object. That's a problem, but maybe it's also a sign that she didn't expect him to kick her out. The author's reaction seems extreme. Even if he's upset, ending the relationship and evicting her without more discussion might be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlso, considering the time frame\u2014three days before she leaves. She had planned it for months, so maybe she should have communicated earlier. But the author didn't give her a chance to resolve the issue or find a compromise. Instead, he escalated immediately. \n\nSo, the key points: the author may have felt justified because he pays for the apartment, but the way he handled it could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend had a right to her autonomy, but she should have discussed the trip earlier. However, the author's response of immediate eviction might be the wrong approach, even if he's upset. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not handling it more calmly and for using the apartment as leverage in the relationship. Alternatively, if the relationship was already in trouble due to the trip announcement, then maybe not. But based on the information, the author's reaction seems harsh and controlling, hence he might be in the wrong.\n"
