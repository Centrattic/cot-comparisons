Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, some context: They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for entirely, and have a history of trust issues from past relationships. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him until three days before, saying he wouldn't have allowed it. The guy felt betrayed because of the lack of communication and trust, leading him to kick her out. She went to her parents' house, and he's now facing backlash for being controlling.\n\nThe main points to consider here are consent, communication, and the dynamics of their relationship. The key issue is the unannounced trip. While traveling alone can be a personal choice, the fact that she didn't discuss it with him despite their emphasis on trust and communication is a problem. However, the way he responded by kicking her out of the apartment he owns might be seen as harsh. \n\nSince he pays for the apartment, he has the right to ask her to leave, but the context of their relationship adds layers. The girlfriend didn't pay for the apartment, so his argument that she doesn't have the right to stay is technically valid. But the breakup over this action could be seen as disproportionate. Trust is crucial in their relationship, and her secrecy might have broken that trust. However, his response of immediate eviction and cutting ties might be seen as extreme, especially since he had the means to support her (offering hotel money), which she declined. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's decision to keep the trip a secret for months despite their emphasis on open communication could be the root of the problem. But the boyfriend's reaction of using the apartment as leverage to end the relationship might be seen as manipulative or controlling, even if he's technically in the right about the living arrangements. The public backlash he received suggests others view his actions as overstepping. \n\nIn relationships where trust is a cornerstone, secrecy can lead to conflict. However, the boyfriend's response of using housing as a punishment could be seen as unfair, especially since he's the one providing the financial support. The girlfriend might have a right to her autonomy, but the lack of communication was a breach. Conversely, the boyfriend's immediate threat to end the relationship might be seen as an excessive reaction to a communication issue that could have been resolved through discussion rather than eviction. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: The girlfriend's secrecy was a mistake, but the boyfriend's response was harsh and possibly vindictive, leveraging their living situation to end the relationship. This could be seen as the author being in the wrong because he used the apartment as a tool to force her out, which might not be a fair or constructive way to handle the situation. Instead of addressing the communication problem, he escalated it by removing her from the home, which is a significant and hurtful action. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
