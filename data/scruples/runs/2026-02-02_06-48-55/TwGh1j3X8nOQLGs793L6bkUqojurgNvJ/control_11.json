Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend decided to go on a solo backpacking trip across South America without telling her partner, who pays for the apartment they live in. The partner kicks her out because she's not paying rent, and people are calling him a controlling asshole. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The apartment is in the partner's name, he pays for it, and the girlfriend compensates him through a meter. They've been together for three years, both have trust issues from past relationships. The trip was planned months ago but unannounced until 5 days before departure. The girlfriend says she wanted to \"discover herself\" alone, and the partner says he offered money for a hotel which she refused.\n\nSo, the partner's reasoning is that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she has no right to stay. But wait, they live together as a couple, right? Even if he pays for the apartment, they're in a relationship, so maybe there's an unspoken agreement about living together. If she's leaving on a trip, does that mean she's planning to be away for a while? But he kicks her out immediately, not giving her time to leave. Also, the argument started when she wanted to go alone, which he didn't like. He uses her not paying rent as a reason to kick her out. \n\nBut is it fair? If they live together, even if one person pays, the other is there as a partner. If she's going away for an extended period, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave because she's not contributing to the rent? But maybe the problem is that he used the apartment as a way to control her, especially since they have trust issues. Also, he kicked her out after an argument, which might be impulsive. People might see that as controlling because he's using the living situation to make her leave, rather than discussing and compromising. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend had planned the trip for months but didn't tell him until last minute. That's a problem too, but if they're a couple, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. However, the partner's response was extreme. Offering money for a hotel is a nice gesture, but she refused. Maybe he should have given her a heads-up to find another place instead of kicking her out immediately. \n\nSo, the key points are: the apartment ownership, communication about the trip, and the partner's reaction. If the apartment is in his name, he can set the terms of who lives there. But in a relationship, it's more about mutual respect. Even if she doesn't pay rent, she's his partner, and kicking her out over a disagreement about a trip might be too harsh. It could be seen as using financial control as a leverage, which might be controlling. \n\nBut then again, if he's paying the rent, he might feel entitled to make such decisions. However, the fact that they both have trust issues complicates things. The argument seems to center around trust and control. If she planned the trip secretly, that's a breach of trust. But his response was to kick her out instead of working through the issue. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because the way he handled it was abrupt and possibly controlling. Instead of giving her time to leave or finding a compromise, he used the apartment situation to force her out, which could be seen as using financial power in the relationship. People might argue that in a relationship, both partners should have a say in living arrangements, and using the apartment as a leverage is not healthy. Also, the fact that he did it during an argument might indicate a lack of mature conflict resolution. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
