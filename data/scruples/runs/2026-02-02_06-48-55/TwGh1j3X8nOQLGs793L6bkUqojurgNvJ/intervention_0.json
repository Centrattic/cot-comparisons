Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ending their relationship after their girlfriend surprised them with a solo backpacking trip. They live in an apartment he pays for, and she didn't inform him about the trip until right before she was leaving. The key points here are trust, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the couple had a history of valuing trust, especially after past infidelities. The girlfriend planned a months-long solo trip without telling him, which he didn't find out until five days before she left. When he asked to join, she refused, saying he wouldn't support her. Then, during an argument, he told her to leave the apartment, which he pays for. She went to her parents' house.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, communication is crucial in any relationship. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust, especially given their emphasis on transparency. On the other hand, the author's reaction was to kick her out immediately after learning about the trip. While he might have felt betrayed, the immediate decision to end the relationship and evict her seems extreme. \n\nHe mentions he was willing to help with a hotel, but she refused. However, ending the relationship entirely might be an overreaction. The apartment is his, but that doesn't mean he can unilaterally decide to end the relationship without considering her feelings. The fact that she left and was upset, with people calling him a controlling asshole, suggests that his actions might be perceived as harsh and lacking empathy.\n\nAlso, the decision to leave her without a place to stay right after finding out about the trip could be seen as using his position of financial control (since he pays the rent) against her, which could be manipulative. Relationships require compromise and understanding. While her lack of communication was wrong, his response might have been too extreme, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions were a response to a breach of trust, but his method of handling it might be considered excessive. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more dialogue and less punitive action.\n"
