Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the context: they've been together three years, live in an apartment he pays for. She wanted a solo backpacking trip, he didn't agree, and he ended the relationship by kicking her out. \n\nSo, the key points here. The apartment is his, she's there because he allows it. She planned a trip she thought he wouldn't support. He felt that since he pays for the place, she wasn't entitled to stay if she was leaving. \n\nBut wait, relationships are built on mutual respect and communication. She had plans for months and didn't tell him. That's a big issue. But he responded by cutting things off abruptly. Maybe he overreacted? \n\nOn one hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which is a problem. On the other, his solution was to end the relationship immediately. Is that a fair response? It depends. If they had always been open, then her secrecy is a problem. But ending the relationship over this might be extreme. \n\nHe says he was willing to give her money for a hotel. But she left anyway. Maybe he felt justified. But dumping someone because they go on a trip they secretly planned isn't something that's universally accepted. \n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014saying she can leave if she wants. But ending the relationship in that moment might have been harsh. Maybe they could have talked it out. \n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. She didn't communicate, but his response might be too drastic. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he ended things might be seen as harsh. \n\nHmm. The answer is probably A, meaning he is in the wrong. Because even if she was wrong, his reaction was to cut off the relationship immediately, which is a strong move. But maybe B because he has valid concerns about trust and living arrangements. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The community usually leans towards considering both sides. In AITA posts, the person who acts impulsively and without communication is often seen as the asshole. So, even if she was wrong, his immediate decision to end the relationship might be seen as the problem. So maybe A.\n"
