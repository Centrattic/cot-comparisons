Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the couple lived together in an apartment the man paid for. They had a history of trust issues because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip abroad, didn't tell him until three days before, and when he didn't like it, he kicked her out. He's asking if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man pays the rent entirely, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share through a meter. The fact that he's the sole renter is important because, legally, he's the one responsible for the lease. If she left, he could end up in trouble if the lease isn't up. But he says he was willing to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. That might be a problem because if she's not paying rent, maybe he can't just kick her out without a proper notice or legal process, depending on local laws.\n\nThe trust angle is also a big part. They were supposed to be open with each other. She planned a trip for months but didn't tell him, which seems like a breach of that trust. However, he did kick her out abruptly, which could be seen as extreme. Ending a relationship because of a disagreement about travel plans might be a strong reaction. Also, the fact that she was going alone and he didn't want her to, but that's her decision, especially if she's an adult. He might not have the right to control her actions unless they had a specific agreement about such trips.\n\nBut then, the way he handled it was to kick her out immediately after the argument. That could be seen as controlling or manipulative, especially if he's the one who owns the apartment and he's using that as leverage in the relationship. In some places, you can't just evict a partner without following legal procedures. So maybe he's wrong in the way he handled it, even if he felt wronged.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions: not telling him about the trip for months, then springing it on him last minute. That's definitely inconsiderate, but it's her right to travel. However, the man's response of kicking her out might be disproportionate. Ending the relationship is one thing, but using the living situation to force her out could be in the wrong, especially if it's not a legal eviction. He might have overstepped by not giving her proper notice or just throwing her out in anger.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: she broke the trust by not being transparent, but his reaction might have been too harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the eviction was legal and he followed proper steps, maybe not. But if he just kicked her out without a valid reason, then yes. Since the story says he told her to pack her bags and get out, that sounds more like an emotional reaction rather than a legal one. So, he's probably in the wrong for the abrupt eviction, even though her not being honest was a problem. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he handled it.\n"
