Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she decided to go on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, the context: they've been in a 3-year relationship, living in an apartment he pays for. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before departure. When he asked why, she said he wouldn't have let her go alone. The argument escalated, and he told her to leave, leading to her going to her parents' house.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip without discussing it with her partner, especially given their emphasis on trust, might be a problem. However, the author's reaction of immediately kicking her out and not allowing her to stay in the house he pays for could be seen as extreme. The house is his, so he has the right to set boundaries, but threatening her with leaving during an argument might be impulsive. \n\nAlso, he mentions he was willing to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. If she's unwilling to take that option, maybe the author's ultimatum was unrealistic. The girlfriend might feel betrayed for not being informed earlier, but the author's response could be seen as overly harsh. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial, especially when one partner has a significant life decision that affects the other. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a red flag, but the author's reaction might not be proportionate. Kicking someone out during a heated argument can be a knee-jerk reaction that doesn't resolve the underlying issue of trust and communication. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the situation. If he's been patient and this was a sudden, unannounced decision that broke their trust, maybe not. But the way he handled it, using her staying in the house as leverage, could be seen as controlling. The argument about her going for \"self-discovery\" alone might have been a catalyst, but the immediate eviction might be crossing a line. \n\nConsidering both sides, it's a tough call. The author's action might stem from hurt and a need for trust, but the method could be too abrupt. The girlfriend's secrecy is bad, but the author's response might be inconsiderate. However, since the house is his and he's not legally obligated to house her, he has the right to ask her to leave. Still, a more constructive approach would have been better. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the girlfriend's actions are problematic, the author's reaction could have been more measured. Using the house as a bargaining chip in the argument might be seen as manipulative, even if it's his property. The immediate eviction without considering other options (like her staying while he respects her trip) might be too harsh. Relationships require both communication and mutual respect, and the author's response might not reflect that balance.\n"
