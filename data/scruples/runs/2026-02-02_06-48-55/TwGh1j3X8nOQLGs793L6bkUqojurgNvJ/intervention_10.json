Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They've been together three years, live in an apartment he pays for, and he lets her pay for her part through a meter. They value trust because they've both been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, didn't tell him, and when confronted, he kicked her out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, even though they live together and have always been open. He had a legitimate concern about her going alone, maybe safety, trust, or the sudden change in their living situation. But the way he responded\u2014kicking her out after a short argument\u2014seems extreme. \n\nHe mentions he was willing to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. However, the immediate eviction without a longer notice could be seen as harsh. They had been together for a long time, and she didn't plan to inform him until 5 days before. That lack of communication is on her side. But his reaction might have been too drastic. \n\nThe author's justification is that she didn't pay for the apartment and thus had no right to stay. But they were in a relationship, so maybe staying in the apartment was part of their mutual agreement. Ending it because of a disagreement over travel plans might not be fair. \n\nAlso, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole is a red flag. Even if there were issues, the way he handled it could be seen as overly controlling. It's possible that he was reacting to a breach of communication he felt was important. But instead of discussing and finding a compromise, he chose to end things abruptly. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's lack of communication is problematic, the author's response might not be proportionate. He could have tried to resolve the issue by discussing boundaries or setting conditions for her trip. Dumping her immediately after an argument without considering her feelings might make him wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
