Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend announced a solo backpacking trip across South America that she had planned for months. The author didn't know about it until 5 days before she was going. They argue, and the author ends up kicking her out of the apartment he pays for, leading her to go stay with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The apartment is paid for entirely by the author, and the girlfriend compensates him using a meter. They've been in a 3-year relationship, both valuing trust because of past infidelities. The girlfriend wanted to travel alone, which the author didn't agree with. The author's reasoning was that since she wasn't paying for the apartment, she had no right to stay, and he offered her money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for dumping her. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Communication and Trust**: They both value trust. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the trip because she thought he wouldn't allow her to go. The author might feel betrayed that she kept such a big decision a secret. However, maybe she had a right to her own experiences, even if it was a surprise. But since they live together, big life decisions might require discussion.\n\n2. **Financial Responsibility**: The author pays the apartment by himself. The girlfriend isn't obligated to stay there, but maybe they made an unspoken agreement that she could stay as long as she contributes. However, the author might see the apartment as his, and thus having the right to ask her to leave if they break up.\n\n3. **Timing of the Announcement**: She told him 5 days before the trip. That's a very short notice for something that was planned for months. Maybe she waited to tell him until she was certain about the plans, but the timing could be seen as inconsiderate. The author had no time to process or adjust.\n\n4. **The Reaction**: The author's response was to kick her out immediately. Is that a proportionate response? She left for her parents, but the author's actions might be seen as harsh, especially if she had nowhere else to go. The argument was that she wasn't paying rent, so he could ask her to leave, but maybe there are other factors like their relationship status and emotional impact.\n\n5. **Control vs. Autonomy**: The author might feel that the trip was a risk, especially since they've been through infidelity issues. But the girlfriend's desire for independence and self-discovery is a valid personal goal. The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting, using the apartment as leverage to control her decisions.\n\n6. **Alternatives**: Could the author have handled it differently? Maybe discussed the trip more calmly, set boundaries, or agreed on a compromise? By immediately asking her to leave, he might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\n7. **Support from Friends/Family**: The girlfriend's friends and family called the author an asshole. That might indicate that the community sees his actions as harsh. However, that's not always reliable, but it's a data point.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's autonomy to travel is important, but she should have communicated better. The author's right to his apartment is valid, but evicting her over a disagreement about travel might be extreme. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Since they were in a relationship, ending it might be fair if there was a fundamental disagreement, but the method of ending it by evicting her could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she had nowhere else to go. However, if the author is not legally obligated to let her stay because she doesn't pay rent, then he might have a point. But the emotional aspect and the way he handled it might still make him the asshole in the eyes of others. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author might be in the wrong because the immediate reaction was to kick her out rather than work through the conflict. Even if he felt betrayed, the solution was disproportionately harsh. The fact that she had planned the trip for months but kept it a secret is a problem, but the author's response could have been more constructive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
