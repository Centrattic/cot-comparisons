Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up with their girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling them. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, they were in a 3-year relationship. The apartment is paid for by the author, and they share the utilities. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. The author was surprised and didn't want her to go alone, leading to an argument. He then told her she could leave the apartment, which she did, and now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and the dynamics of their living situation. The girlfriend hadn't discussed the trip with him because she thought he wouldn't approve. That's a problem because even if they have trust, big life decisions like a solo trip should probably be discussed in a relationship. But she had been planning it for months, so maybe she felt it was her personal time. \n\nThe author then kicked her out of their shared apartment. Since he pays the rent, he technically has the right to ask her to leave, but they were still in a relationship. Ending the relationship by asking her to leave might be seen as harsh, especially if the disagreement was over something that's a personal choice. However, the fact that she kept it a secret for so long adds another layer. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel hurt that she didn't include him in such a big decision, especially since they share a home. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt she needed to do this for herself. The author could have reacted more calmly, maybe by discussing boundaries or negotiating. Instead, he made it a ultimatum, which led to the breakup.\n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. If he had discussed it more and given her a chance to explain or compromise, maybe. But by immediately ending the relationship, it might have been too abrupt. However, if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, then his decision was based on his values. \n\nI think the author's reaction was a bit extreme. Kicking someone out of the house over a disagreement, even if you're the one paying the rent, can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend had been planning the trip for months, so maybe she had a right to do it. The author could have handled it differently, like talking about it more and maybe setting some terms. But the fact that he decided to end the relationship immediately might make others think he was the one being controlling, even if the initial secrecy was on her part. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate. He could have kept the relationship going by communicating better instead of using the apartment as leverage to end things. So, Answer A.\n"
