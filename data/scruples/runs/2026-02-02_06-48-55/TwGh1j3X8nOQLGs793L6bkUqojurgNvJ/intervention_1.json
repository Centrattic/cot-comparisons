Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, which he found unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. They mention that they had a two-bedroom apartment, and he pays for it entirely, even though she compensates him. They were in a three-year relationship and had trust issues from past relationships. The key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he didn't know about until she told him. He asked to come along, she refused, saying he wouldn't allow her to go alone. He then reacted by telling her to leave the house. The question is whether his reaction was wrong.\n\nFrom a perspective of communication, if she had discussed this with him earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But she didn't, and he felt betrayed. However, kicking her out seems extreme. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, it's their shared home. Throwing her out without a place to stay could be seen as harsh. He offered money for a hotel, but that might not be enough given the short notice.\n\nAlso, their relationship's foundation on trust means that her keeping such a big decision a secret could have violated that trust. But his response of making her leave might have been an overreaction. The people calling him a controlling asshole might be right because he's enforcing his will by removing her from their home over a disagreement.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were both committed to communication, she should have started the conversation earlier. But when she did bring it up, his immediate reaction was to end the relationship. Maybe there's a deeper issue in the relationship's communication style. The author's justification is that she didn't pay for the apartment, but that doesn't negate the emotional impact of his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, the author's response of forcing her out seems excessive and controlling. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
