Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and he responded by kicking her out of their apartment. The apartment is in his name, and he pays for it because he wanted to be considerate of her finances.\n\nFirst, communication is a big part of relationships. She had been planning the trip for months but didn't tell him until the last minute. That's a problem because they were supposed to be open with each other due to past issues with trust. But on the other hand, she might have thought he would disapprove, which he did. His reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme. \n\nHe did offer her money for a hotel, but she didn't take it. Maybe that's because she wanted to leave on her own terms. However, using her leaving as a punishment for going on the trip seems harsh. They had been in a relationship for three years, so this sudden decision and the way he handled it might have been too abrupt. \n\nAlso, considering that she had a history of being cheated on, maybe she felt the need to assert her independence. But he had a valid point about trust and communication. The fact that he owns the apartment gives him that legal right, but emotionally, it's a different story. Relationships require compromise, and maybe he should have tried to discuss it more instead of making it an ultimatum. \n\nOn the flip side, he did give her an option to leave if she wanted to go on the trip. So maybe he was standing his ground because he felt she hadn't respected their agreement about communication. But the way he phrased it as \"pack your bags and get out\" might have been more about anger than a mature discussion. \n\nIn the end, the key points are communication breakdown and the harshness of the response. Even if she was wrong for not informing him earlier, his reaction could have been more constructive. So, maybe he's in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if he had his reasons.\n"
