Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: they're in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, and she helps with utilities. They've always emphasized trust because both had issues with infidelity before. She wanted a solo trip, which he didn't agree with, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are communication and trust. She didn't inform him about the trip until it was close to happening, even though she had planned it for months. His reaction was to kick her out of the house, which he owns, and then end the relationship. \n\nFrom his perspective, he might feel that trust is a cornerstone of their relationship, and she breaking that trust by not discussing the trip could justify his actions. However, from her side, she might see her solo trip as a personal goal, and his reaction as controlling, especially since he's the one providing the home. \n\nThe problem is whether withholding information about a major life decision for months is a valid reason to break up. Also, kicking her out of the home (which he owns) could be seen as extreme. Even if he's not obligated to let her stay, the action comes off as harsh. \n\nTrust issues are mutual here. He trusted her enough to let her live with him, but she didn't communicate a significant plan. However, his response might have been too abrupt. Maybe a discussion could have resolved it without breaking up. \n\nThe fact that others called him controlling suggests that his method of ending things might have been too harsh. While he's not wrong about her lack of communication, his solution (kicking her out and breaking up immediately) might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for reacting too strongly and not addressing the issue through communication. The right approach would be to discuss the problem and work towards a solution, not an immediate breakup.\n"
