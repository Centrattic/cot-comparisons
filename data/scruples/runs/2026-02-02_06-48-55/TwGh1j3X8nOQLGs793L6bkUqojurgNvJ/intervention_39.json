Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after the girlfriend planned a solo trip without telling her partner. The writer paid for the apartment and they had an agreement about sharing expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a strong emphasis on trust due to past issues. The girlfriend had always been into traveling, and this trip was planned for months. The main conflict is that she didn't inform her partner, who felt that she didn't respect their relationship enough. The writer decided to end the relationship by kicking her out, leading to backlash.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend had a history of traveling and had planned this trip for months. She might have thought she was being honest, but maybe she didn't communicate properly. On the other hand, the author was paying for the apartment, and the girlfriend's unannounced trip could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author felt that if she could leave without notice, it undermined the trust they built. \n\nBut the key point is the method of ending the relationship. The author said, \"you can go without me,\" leading her to leave. Is that a reasonable response? In a relationship, communication is crucial. If a partner is making a major life decision (like a solo trip) without discussion, it's valid to express concern. However, responding by kicking her out of the house might be seen as extreme. The author had the financial responsibility for the apartment, so if they couldn't resolve the issue, ending the relationship is one option, but doing it in the middle of an argument could be impulsive. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were a breach of communication, but the author's response might have been harsh. Ending a 3-year relationship over this without prior discussion could be seen as the author's fault. They might have needed to address the issue more calmly rather than using the trip as a catalyst for an immediate breakup. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more dialogue and for reacting impulsively. The girlfriend's lack of communication is problematic, but the author's method of ending things could have been more considerate.\n"
