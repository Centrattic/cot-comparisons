Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she told him about her planned solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for three years, live in a two-bedroom apartment he pays for entirely. She compensates him for her share of the utilities. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The issue is she planned a solo trip for months without telling him and decided to go alone, which he didn't want. He then told her she could leave his home, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here. The GF planned a trip without informing him. He felt she should have communicated it. Their relationship was based on trust and transparency. However, he took the extreme step of kicking her out of his house, which he pays for. \n\nWait, but he was paying for the apartment, and she didn't contribute to the rent. But she did cover her utility costs. So she wasn't a free rider in that sense. However, the main issue is the communication. He says she didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't allow it. She had the right to travel, but maybe the way she handled it was wrong. \n\nBut when he kicked her out, that's a big move. The apartment is his, so technically, he can ask her to leave if they're not in a lease together. But since they were in a relationship, breaking up and evicting her so abruptly might be harsh. Also, he offered money for a hotel, which she declined. \n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. If she didn't communicate a major life decision, that's a problem. But responding by ending the relationship and evicting her might be overreacting. \n\nHe might have a point about wanting transparency, but his reaction seems extreme. The fact that he paid for the apartment could mean he felt taken advantage of, but if they were in a committed relationship, it's not just about money. It's about mutual respect and communication. \n\nOn the other hand, she planned a trip for months without telling him, possibly knowing he'd disapprove. That's a breach of trust. But the way he ended it by kicking her out might have been too harsh, especially if they were still a couple. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the lack of communication justifies the immediate breakup and eviction. If the core of their relationship was trust, and she violated that by not sharing major plans, then he's justified. But if the response was disproportionate, then he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the main issue was the lack of communication from her side, and he had the right to set boundaries, especially regarding his home. However, some might argue that the reaction was too harsh. But given the context of trust being a cornerstone, maybe he's justified.\n"
