Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is the one paying for their apartment, and the girlfriend decided to go on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. They had a big argument, and he ended up asking her to leave the apartment she's living in because he was the one paying for it. She left and he's now wondering if he was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They mentioned they place a lot of importance on trust, both having been cheated on before. That's a key point. Trust is a big part of their relationship, so when she goes on a trip without telling him, that could be seen as a breach of trust. But wait, she said she had been planning it for months and was going to go on a solo trip to \"discover herself.\" The author didn't know about it until she announced it, and she didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't allow it. \n\nNow, the author responded by saying she could leave the apartment since he pays for it. The apartment is in his name, so technically, he can ask her to leave if they're not in a legal partnership or lease together. But the question is whether that action was justified in terms of their relationship. \n\nHe offered to pay for a hotel for a week, but she refused. So he's trying to be fair by giving her temporary housing. But the way he phrased the ultimatum might come off as harsh. When she said she wanted to live life to the fullest, he responded with making her leave the house. That could be seen as a direct reaction to her independence, which might not be the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective: she wanted to take a solo trip, which is a personal choice. If they had discussed travel plans before and maybe set boundaries, this might have been preventable. But she planned it for months and didn't inform him, which could be a problem. However, if the relationship was supposed to be built on trust, maybe he should have given her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe author's action of ending the relationship and asking her to leave the apartment might be a reaction to feeling disrespected or betrayed by her not informing him. But was it necessary to terminate the relationship over it? Maybe they could have had a more open conversation to work it out. Instead, he made a decisive move without giving her a chance to explain or compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, if the apartment is in his name and he's the sole financial provider, legally he has the right to ask her to leave. But in a relationship, that's a big deal. It's not just about legalities but about mutual respect and communication. Maybe the problem isn't just the trip but the underlying issues of trust and communication. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong from a legal standpoint, but in terms of relationship handling, his reaction could be seen as extreme. However, if the trust was broken by her not informing him about a major decision, then maybe his reaction is a consequence of that broken trust. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key factors are the importance of trust they emphasized and the fact that she didn't communicate her plans. The author's response might be a way to enforce boundaries based on their agreed-upon trust. But kicking someone out of the home they live in, even if they don't pay for it, is a drastic step. There could have been a more constructive way to address the issue without ending the relationship immediately. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective you take. Legally, he might have a right to ask her to leave, but emotionally and relationally, his approach might be seen as harsh. Since the question is about being in the wrong in a relationship context, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the sudden breakup. But I'm a bit conflicted. If they had a mutual understanding about important decisions, then her not informing him was a breach, and his reaction could be justified. But the way he handled it could be seen as controlling, especially since she was living in the apartment with him. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
