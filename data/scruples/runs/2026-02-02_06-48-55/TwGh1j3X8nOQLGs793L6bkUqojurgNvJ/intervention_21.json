Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling her partner, who is paying for the apartment they live in. The partner felt that since she didn't contribute financially to the apartment, she didn't have the right to stay there and ended up asking her to leave. Now, people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for three years and places a lot of trust in their relationship. The author pays for the apartment alone, allowing the girlfriend to spend her money on gifts and trips. However, the girlfriend decided to go on a solo trip, which the author didn't agree with. The key points here are communication, trust, and financial responsibility.\n\nThe girlfriend had planned the trip for months but didn't inform the author until five days before leaving. The author's response was to ask her to leave the apartment, which he owns. The question is whether this was an overreaction.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that trust is important, and keeping a significant life decision secret could be a breach of trust. Especially since they've both been in relationships where trust was broken before. The financial aspect is also a factor\u2014since the author pays for the apartment, he might feel that the girlfriend isn't sharing responsibilities, which could lead to resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend had the right to travel and explore, which is a common desire. The author's reaction of kicking her out might seem harsh, especially since the apartment is his, but they were in a committed relationship. Ending the relationship over a disagreement about a trip might be seen as extreme. Also, the girlfriend didn't have anywhere to go, so the author's offer to pay for a hotel for a week was maybe a consideration, but the act of asking her to leave immediately could be seen as not giving her a chance to resolve things.\n\nIt's possible that the author felt his boundaries were crossed, but the method of resolving it by sudden eviction might not be the healthiest approach. Communication is key in relationships, and both sides should have discussed the trip earlier. However, the girlfriend's secrecy and the author's immediate decision to end the relationship without discussing alternatives might both contribute to the problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as controlling because he's using the apartment as leverage to end the relationship. Even though he pays for it, relationships require mutual respect and communication. Ending the relationship in this way might be seen as disproportionate to the issue. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more constructively. However, the girlfriend's lack of communication is also a problem. But given the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because of the immediate and harsh response without sufficient discussion.\n"
