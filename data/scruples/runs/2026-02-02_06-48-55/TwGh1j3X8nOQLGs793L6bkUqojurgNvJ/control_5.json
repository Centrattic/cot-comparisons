Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after the girlfriend went on an unannounced solo trip.\n\nFirst, some context: They were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment, and they have a system where she compensates him. They value trust and openness. She had planned a solo trip for months, but didn't tell him until 5 days before. He didn't want her to go alone, and after an argument, he told her to leave his house. Now he's asking if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is the surprise trip. She didn't communicate it with him, even though they had a history of being open. He felt it was a breach of trust or something. He kicked her out because he thought she didn't have a right to stay, given she didn't pay for the apartment. He offered a hotel for a week but she refused.\n\nHmm. Is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. If she had communicated her plans earlier, maybe they could have discussed it. But she didn't, and that's a problem. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out\u2014seems extreme. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, they were in a relationship. Ending it because of a disagreement over travel plans might be a bit harsh. Also, the fact that he took it to the point of making her leave immediately might be seen as controlling, especially since others called him an asshole. \n\nAlso, the apartment situation: if he's the one who pays, maybe she wasn't obligated to stay. But in a relationship, you usually aren't required to let someone stay if you're the one paying. But ending the relationship over it is another matter. Maybe he had the right to ask her to leave if they broke up, but the way he framed it as \"you can leave without me\" seems a bit like using the house as leverage, which might not be fair. \n\nBut then, she had been planning this for months and didn't tell him, which is a breach of trust. They both valued trust since they were cheated on before. So maybe he had a reason to be upset. However, the immediate response of ending the relationship and kicking her out might be excessive. There's a difference between being upset and reacting in a controlling way. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, she didn't communicate important life plans. On the other, his reaction was to end the relationship abruptly. It's possible both have some responsibility here. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether his actions were justified. \n\nIn many cases, using someone's housing as a leverage to end a relationship is seen as controlling. Even if he owns the apartment, the emotional impact of forcing her to leave immediately after a breakup could be seen as harsh. So maybe he's in the wrong. But others might argue that he had the right to set boundaries. \n\nBut given that the community often reacts against controlling behavior, and the fact that he's being called an asshole by others, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong). However, if the relationship was already strained due to lack of communication, maybe not. \n\nI think the key point is that while she didn't communicate, his reaction was to use the housing situation to end the relationship, which can be seen as unfair. So the answer is A.\n"
