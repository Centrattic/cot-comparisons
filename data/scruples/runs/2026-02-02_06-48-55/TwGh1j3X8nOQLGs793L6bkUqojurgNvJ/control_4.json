Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping their girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, context is important. They were in a 3-year relationship. The author paid for the apartment alone, and the girlfriend used a meter to compensate for her share. They both value trust, given past issues. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which the author found out about only days before she was to leave. He didn't know she was going, and she admitted she kept it a secret because he wouldn't approve. The argument led to him telling her to leave his house.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is the sole provider for the apartment, so the financial aspect is a factor. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be seen as breaking the trust they valued. However, the way the author handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014could be seen as harsh. Even though she didn't pay for the apartment, they live together, and evicting someone without notice isn't typical. The author might feel justified due to the broken trust, but the method and timing of the breakup could be questionable. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend going on a solo trip isn't inherently wrong. People do travel alone. The problem was the lack of communication. But the author's reaction\u2014using the house as leverage\u2014might be too extreme. It's possible that a more constructive discussion could have resolved the issue without immediate eviction. The author's actions led to public backlash, which others see as controlling. However, if the relationship had underlying issues with trust and control, maybe the author felt this was necessary. \n\nIn the end, whether it's right or wrong depends on the relationship's context. The author might be in the right if the trust was broken and he felt it was the only way to handle it, but the abruptness and using housing as a punishment could make him look wrong. The key points are communication breakdown, trust issues, and the appropriateness of the response.\n"
