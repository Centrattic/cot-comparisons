Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple lived together in an apartment that the author paid for. The girlfriend had been planning a solo trip for months but told him only days before, saying he wouldn't have allowed her to go alone. The author reacted by telling her to leave the house. Now, people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's unsure if he was right.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip until last minute, she wanted to go solo, and the author kicked her out because she wasn't paying for the apartment. The author's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the place, she had no right to demand to stay. But he's questioning if that's controlling.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They were in a 3-year relationship, and trust was important because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be seen as a breach of trust or communication. However, the author's response of kicking her out could be seen as extreme. \n\nThe author's argument is that since he paid for the apartment, she could leave if she chose. But maybe the key issue is the timing and lack of communication. The girlfriend had been planning the trip for months but told him only days before. That's a big decision that affects the relationship, especially if they had a history of valuing communication and trust. \n\nBut then, the author's reaction of ending the relationship by kicking her out might be disproportionate. Even if she didn't communicate properly, the response could be seen as overly harsh. Ending a three-year relationship over a solo trip that she had planned but didn't communicate well might be too extreme. \n\nAlso, considering that the girlfriend's reason for not telling him was that he wouldn't have allowed her to go alone, it suggests that there might have been past conflicts about her traveling solo. If the author had concerns, maybe he should have addressed them earlier instead of reacting with an ultimatum. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his boundaries were not respected. If the relationship was built on trust, maybe the girlfriend should have communicated better. But kicking someone out of their shared home over this seems like a big step. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the girlfriend's lack of communication is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as too harsh. The fact that he's getting called controlling suggests that his actions might be overstepping. Even if he pays for the apartment, ending the relationship by making her leave immediately might not be justified. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate to the issue. The situation involves communication breakdown, but the solution (kicking her out) was extreme and could be seen as controlling, especially since they were in a place where trust was important. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
