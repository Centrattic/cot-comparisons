Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple breaking up after the girlfriend goes on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The author says he paid for the apartment alone and kicked her out after the argument.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The couple had open communication and trust, which is important. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which the author wasn't okay with. She said he wouldn't have allowed her to go, so she kept it a secret. The author then told her to leave because he considered the apartment his, and she wasn't contributing financially. \n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that since he pays for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to demand staying. But was the timing of her announcement an issue? She said she planned it for months but told him only 5 days before. That seems like poor communication. Also, the author's response was to kick her out, which might be harsh. Even if he pays for the place, they were in a 3-year relationship. Did he have the right to end it so abruptly?\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been selfish, but the author's reaction could be seen as controlling or using the living situation as a leverage in the breakup. If the apartment is in his name, he might have a legal right to ask her to leave, but emotionally, it's complicated. The author's friends and family are calling him an asshole, which might indicate societal judgment. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about her not paying for the apartment and being willing to give her money for a hotel\u2014does that show he was reasonable? Maybe, but the way he ended the relationship might be seen as cold. The question is whether his actions were justified. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, which could be a breach of trust. The author then took a stand by ending the relationship. However, using the housing situation as the reason to end things might be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the apartment is his and he's allowed to end the relationship, maybe not. But the way he handled it, using the eviction as a punishment, might be wrong. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the abrupt and potentially controlling action, even if the girlfriend was wrong in keeping the trip a secret. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
