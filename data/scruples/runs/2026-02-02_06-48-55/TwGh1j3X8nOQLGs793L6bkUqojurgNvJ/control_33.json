Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for ending the relationship after their girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip without telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The couple had been together for three years, living in an apartment that the author pays for entirely. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, didn't inform the author, and when confronted, said he wouldn't have allowed her to go. The author then kicked her out, leading to the argument about whether he was right or wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication, trust, and financial responsibility. The author paid for the apartment, and the girlfriend used a meter to contribute. The trip was unannounced, which the author found surprising. The girlfriend's reasons for not telling him were because he wouldn't have supported it, which he admitted was mostly true.\n\nNow, let's think about trust. Since they both value trust highly, the girlfriend's decision to go on a trip without informing him might have broken that trust. The author's response was to end the relationship, which seems drastic, but maybe in the context of their relationship dynamics, it's seen as a justified action. He gave her a choice to leave, which he felt was fair since she didn't pay the rent. But kicking someone out after three years might come off as harsh, especially if the trip was something she had been planning for months, even if she didn't communicate it in time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did admit that he didn't want her to go alone. The girlfriend's decision to withhold information for months could be seen as a breach of their mutual trust. If they had always been open about their lives and plans, this unannounced trip might be a deal-breaker. The author's response was a direct consequence of that, using the fact that he paid for the apartment as a reason to let her go. \n\nHowever, ending a relationship over a solo trip, especially when it's something the partner wanted to do, might be seen as controlling. Even if the author is paying for the apartment, the girlfriend's autonomy in her personal choices could be a factor. The author's threat to have her leave the apartment because she didn't tell him about the trip could be seen as using financial leverage to control her decisions, which might be problematic.\n\nBut considering their past experiences with cheating and the emphasis on trust, maybe the author felt that the lack of communication was a significant issue. The girlfriend's decision to plan a trip without involving him, especially when he expressed concern, might have made him feel disrespected or not trusted. The author's action of kicking her out might be his way of enforcing the trust they had agreed on.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend contributes through the meter. Since she doesn't pay the rent directly, he might feel he has the right to make decisions about the living situation. However, ending a relationship by forcing someone out of the home is a severe step and could be seen as using financial power in a way that's not healthy in a relationship.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are: the importance of trust in their relationship, the girlfriend's unannounced plans, the author's reaction, and the financial dynamics. The author's actions could be viewed as a justified response to a breach of trust, especially given their past. However, the method of ending the relationship by immediately kicking her out might be seen as extreme and controlling, regardless of the underlying reasons. It's a balance between respecting autonomy and maintaining trust. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on relationship boundaries and communication.\n"
