Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him and then left, and he kicked her out of their apartment because he pays for it. They've been together three years, and there's a history of trust issues because they both were cheated on before.\n\nFirst, the apartment is his, he pays for it. She's there, but she's not paying rent. Now, she goes on a trip that she had planned for months but didn't tell him. He wanted to come, but she said no because it was for her to \"discover herself.\" He argues that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to stay, so he asked her to leave. His reasoning is that if she wanted to leave, she could, but she didn't need his home. He even offered money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, trust, and shared living arrangements. In a committed relationship, especially when one person is paying for the home, there's an expectation of communication. She planned a trip that would take her away for a significant period, but didn't discuss it with him beforehand. That's a big deal because it affects their living situation. If she had told him earlier, maybe they could have worked it out. But she didn't, and now she's leaving, and he's upset.\n\nBut wait, why didn't she tell him? She said he wouldn't have allowed her to go, especially alone. So maybe there was a fear of conflict. However, in a relationship where trust is important, not communicating such a big plan is a problem. He had the right to set boundaries, especially regarding the apartment he pays for. If she's going to be away for a while, it's reasonable that he wants to have a say, even if it's his apartment.\n\nBut then he responds by kicking her out. The apartment is his, so he can ask her to leave, right? But is it appropriate to use that as a punishment for not telling him about the trip? Maybe he should have addressed the issue of her trip first, discussed it, and then decided whether she could stay or not. Instead, he immediately used the apartment as leverage. That might have been a harsh reaction. However, since she's not paying rent, he's not obligated to let her stay. So maybe he's within his rights, but the way he handled it might be seen as controlling.\n\nAlso, the fact that he offered money for a hotel and she refused complicates things. Maybe he was trying to be helpful, but she didn't accept his help. The people calling him a controlling asshole might be reacting to the immediate kickout without prior discussion. On the other hand, if the apartment is entirely his and she's not contributing, maybe he's justified in his decision.\n\nBut in a relationship, such a major decision as a solo trip that affects their shared living situation should be discussed. Her not telling him is a breach of communication, which he's reacting to. However, using the apartment as a means to force her out might be seen as disproportionate. He could have expressed his disappointment, set boundaries, and perhaps given her an ultimatum if the trip was a deal-breaker. But kicking her out immediately might be seen as too harsh, especially if the trip was already planned and she had no intention of canceling.\n\nAnother angle: they have trust issues from past relationships. Trust is crucial. Her not discussing the trip could be seen as breaking that trust, even if it's for her personal growth. His reaction might be a defense mechanism, but it's possible that he overreacted. However, given the circumstances of the apartment and the lack of communication, he's not entirely wrong.\n\nIn summary, the girlfriend's lack of communication is problematic, and the author's reaction might be a valid response to that. However, the method of kicking her out immediately without prior discussion might be seen as harsh. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. But since the apartment is his and he's paying for it, he has the right to ask her to leave. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he handled it could be seen as controlling. Hmm. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's within his rights regarding the apartment, but others might see it as controlling. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key is whether he's justified in using the apartment as leverage. Since she's not paying for it, he's justified in his decision. So, B.\n"
