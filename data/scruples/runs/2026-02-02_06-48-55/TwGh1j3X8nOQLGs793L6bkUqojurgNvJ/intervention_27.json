Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip. The situation is that the couple lived in an apartment where he paid for everything, and she had planned a trip without telling him. He kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment and thought she didn't have the right to stay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication issues. They were in a 3-year relationship, which should have established a lot of trust, as they mentioned. She wanted to travel, which isn't inherently wrong. But she didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving, which is a short notice. He was against her going alone, which is understandable. But then he responds by kicking her out. \n\nHe says he offered money for a hotel, but she refused. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing her plans earlier. Even though she didn't pay for the apartment, she was living there, so maybe he should have considered her feelings more. \n\nHe says she said he wouldn't have allowed her to go, which is why she kept it a secret. That shows a lack of communication from both sides. But he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. Instead, he made a drastic decision. \n\nTrust is a big part of their relationship. If she kept a big trip a secret, that might break trust. However, he could have handled it without ending the relationship. Kicking her out immediately seems harsh. Maybe he's using the apartment payment as a reason to justify his actions, but the core issue is their communication and trust.\n\nSo, while she did something he didn't like, his response was extreme. He should have tried to resolve the conflict without ending the relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
