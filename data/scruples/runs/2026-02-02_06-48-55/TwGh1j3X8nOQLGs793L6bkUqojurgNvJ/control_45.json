Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping their girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The couple has been together for three years, the man lives in a two-bedroom apartment he pays for alone. The woman contributes by covering her share of the utilities. They value trust because both have been cheated on before. The woman planned a solo trip to South America and didn't tell her partner until last minute, saying she wanted to \"discover herself.\" The man felt she wasn't being honest and told her to leave, which she did, moving in with her parents.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the man overreacted. The woman had been planning this trip for months but told him only days before departure. She didn't want to involve him because she thought he wouldn't support her going alone. That's a problem because communication is key in a relationship. If she planned this for months, she should have discussed it earlier. Not telling him for months could be seen as a breach of trust, which they both value.\n\nThe man's response was to kick her out of the apartment. He owns it, so he's within his rights to ask her to leave. But the emotional aspect is trickier. He felt her secrecy was a betrayal of trust, especially given their history. However, reacting by immediately ending the relationship might be seen as extreme. She had already made the decision and was just telling him, not asking for his permission. The man's ultimatum could be seen as controlling if the relationship wasn't equal. But if he felt that her lack of communication was a deal-breaker, maybe it's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman had a right to her own plans, but she needed to communicate better. The man's anger might be valid, but the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out of the home\u2014could be too harsh, especially if the apartment is shared. Wait, the apartment is 2-bedroom, and he pays for it. If she's living there, even if not paying rent, he can't just kick her out without notice unless they had an agreement. But if they're in a relationship, it's about mutual respect. \n\nThe man says he was willing to give her money for a hotel, which she refused. So he's giving her some support. But the immediate breakup might have been triggered by his feeling that her secret trip was a betrayal. However, if she had a right to make her own choices, even if they didn't agree, ending the relationship over it might be too quick. \n\nThe key points are communication breakdown and the man's response. The woman didn't communicate the trip, which is a big issue in a trusting relationship. But the man's reaction of ending the relationship might be too harsh. However, considering their history and the importance they placed on trust, maybe he made a justified decision. \n\nIt's a tough call. The woman's secrecy is a problem, but the man's response could be seen as controlling. But he's not in the wrong if he felt the trust was broken. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for the trust they valued, but others might see it as A. But according to the given choices, I need to decide.\n"
