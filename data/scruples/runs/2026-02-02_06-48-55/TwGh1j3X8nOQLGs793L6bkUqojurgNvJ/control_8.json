Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dumping their girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, some context: They were in a 3-year relationship. He lives in a two-bedroom apartment he pays for entirely, and she helps with the utilities. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving. He didn't want her to go alone and ended up telling her she could leave the apartment, which she did, moving in with her parents.\n\nNow, the main points to consider. The key issue is communication. She had planned the trip for months but didn't mention it until close to departure. That's a big red flag. In a relationship, especially one that values trust, keeping such a significant plan hidden for months is problematic. It shows a lack of openness, which contradicts their shared value of trust.\n\nHe was okay with her traveling but not alone. His response was to kick her out of the apartment, which he owns, and he offered to pay for a hotel. However, the immediate reaction of ending the relationship by evicting her might be seen as extreme. The problem is that the decision to leave is hers, not his. He can't force her to stay, but cutting her off completely could be seen as harsh, especially since she's his ex now. \n\nBut on the other hand, she didn't respect his boundaries. If he made it clear that solo travel without his knowledge was a deal-breaker, then she should have considered that before planning. The fact that she lied about planning it for months could be a breach of trust, which is a core value in their relationship. \n\nThe argument here is whether the response was proportionate. Ending the relationship because she went on a trip without telling him, especially when the apartment is his, might be justified if trust is a cornerstone. However, the way he handled it\u2014by kicking her out immediately\u2014could be seen as cutting off the relationship without giving it a chance to be discussed. \n\nBut considering that she was planning a solo trip in secret, which he found out last minute, and he felt it was a violation of their trust, his decision to end things might be seen as a reaction to her breach. However, the method of ending\u2014by evicting her from their home\u2014could be problematic if it was more about controlling her rather than addressing the underlying issue. \n\nIn summary, the main issues are: her lack of communication about a major life decision, his reaction based on their trust issues, and whether his response was appropriate. The key is whether the response was a justified reaction to her breach of trust or an overreaction. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the breach of trust was significant enough to justify ending the relationship immediately. Given the emphasis on trust in their relationship, it might be seen as justified. However, the method of ending it could be questioned. But the core issue is her actions leading up to the breakup.\n"
