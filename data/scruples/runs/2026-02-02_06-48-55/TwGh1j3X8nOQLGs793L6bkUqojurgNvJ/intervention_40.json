Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment himself, even though the girlfriend contributes to the expenses. They both value trust a lot because they've been cheated on before. The girlfriend loves traveling and has gone on trips together with him, but this time she planned a solo trip to South America. She told him that she didn't plan to inform him because he wouldn't have allowed her to go, especially alone. The argument led to the author telling her to leave his home, and she did, going to her parents' house. People are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's questioning if he's right.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the trip because she thought he would be against it. The author felt that since he pays for the apartment, she shouldn't demand to stay and offered to pay for a hotel, which she refused. \n\nI think the issue is about how the author responded. Even though the girlfriend didn't share the plans, the way he reacted by kicking her out might have been too harsh. Relationships require open communication, and the girlfriend might have expected him to be more understanding, especially since she's been planning it for months. On the other hand, the author might feel that she broke trust by not informing him of such a significant decision affecting their living situation. \n\nBut considering that they live in his apartment and he pays for it, maybe he had the right to set boundaries. However, the method of setting that boundary was confrontational and possibly unnecessary. Instead of immediately telling her to leave, maybe a discussion about how her decision affects their living arrangement would have been better. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasoning for not telling him is that she felt he wouldn't support her going solo. If they had discussed it earlier, perhaps there could have been a compromise. The author might have thought that her not informing him was a breach of trust, but maybe he should have handled it differently. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The girlfriend's autonomy and desire to travel is important, but the author's right to expect communication on major decisions is also a factor. The outcome was a breakup, but was it justified? If the author's response was overly controlling, even if he feels justified, then he's in the wrong. But if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, maybe not. \n\nI think the author's reaction was too extreme. Kicking someone out of their home because they made a solo travel decision without consulting him seems harsh. Even if he pays for the apartment, their relationship dynamics should allow for some mutual discussion about significant life choices. The fact that he offered money for a hotel shows he wasn't entirely against her trip, but his method of enforcing the boundary was more about control than resolving the communication issue. So maybe he is in the wrong here.\n"
