Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him. He found out a few days before she was supposed to leave and then kicked her out of their apartment, which he pays for. The user is asking if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The apartment is paid for by him, and she doesn't pay rent. They've been in a relationship for three years and trust is important because both have been cheated on before. She wanted to go on a solo trip, which he didn't agree with. He said she could leave if she didn't need the security of their home. She went to her parents' place after the argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, which he found out last minute. Since he's the one paying for the apartment, maybe he felt she wasn't respecting his financial commitment. But on the other hand, she had been planning it for months and wanted to do it alone, which is her right as an individual. \n\nThe argument here is whether he was too controlling. He gave her an ultimatum, telling her to leave if she wanted to go. Since she didn't have a financial stake in the apartment, maybe he was justified in saying she could leave. However, kicking someone out of a shared home can be seen as harsh, especially without a prior agreement. Relationships require mutual respect and communication, so maybe she should have discussed the trip earlier, but he also had a responsibility to handle the situation without forcing her out immediately. \n\nThe fact that she didn't pay for the apartment complicates things. He might feel it's his decision about the home, but she was living there as well. If they were cohabiting, even if one person pays, it's usually expected that both have a say in the living arrangements. By not allowing her to stay once she decided to go, he might have overstepped. \n\nAlso, his friends calling him a controlling asshole suggests that some people see it that way. However, his reasoning is that she wasn't contributing financially, so she didn't have the right to stay. But that's a bit of a stretch because people often live together even if one pays the rent. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, trust is important, but so is giving each other space. However, breaking up because of a disagreement over a trip might be too extreme. The author might be reacting out of hurt or feeling disrespected by the last-minute announcement. But the immediate reaction of kicking her out and ending the relationship could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely wrong, but there are definitely aspects where he could have handled it better. However, since he's the one who paid for the apartment, some might argue he had the right to ask her to leave if she wasn't going to stay. But the way he did it\u2014using the ultimatum during an argument\u2014might be questionable. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because while there are valid points on both sides, the act of kicking her out immediately after an argument without trying to resolve the issue might be too harsh. Communication was lacking from her side, but his response was also extreme. In a healthy relationship, even if there's a disagreement, the solution shouldn't involve immediate eviction unless there's a serious violation. So, he overreacted.\n"
