Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment entirely, and she helps with the utilities. They both value trust because of past cheating issues. She loves traveling and had planned a solo trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about. When he found out, he said she could go but without him or his home's security, leading her to leave. He's being called an asshole, but he thinks he did the right thing since she didn't pay for the apartment.\n\nSo, the key points are: She planned a solo trip she didn't tell him about, he kicked her out, and he's now questioning if he was wrong. \n\nHmm, in relationships, communication is crucial. She didn't inform him about something significant\u2014a months-long plan. That could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they value trust a lot. However, his response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. She's living in his apartment, but she's not the one paying the rent. If she left, maybe he's in the right because she's not obligated to stay there. But on the other hand, ending a relationship over an argument where he evicted her might be too extreme.\n\nHe says she was planning it for months but didn't tell him. Why didn't she communicate? That's a problem. But his reaction was to push her out immediately. Maybe he overreacted. Also, considering they had trust issues, her not sharing such a big plan might have triggered his insecurities. But is it his right to kick her out? If she's not paying rent, technically he can ask her to leave. But emotionally, it's complicated. \n\nHe offered money for a hotel, which she refused. Maybe she thought she could just stay. But by the lease agreement, if she's not the one paying, he can ask her to leave. So legally, maybe he's okay. But morally, is it right to end a relationship by evicting someone? That's a tough call. \n\nOn one hand, she didn't respect his boundaries or communicate. On the other, his actions led to her leaving, which might have been sudden. So, the answer might be a mix. But the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is communication from her side, but his reaction was to kick her out. While he's within his rights to ask her to leave since she's not paying rent, ending the relationship by doing so might not be the best approach. However, given the context of trust and her not informing him, maybe he's justified in feeling betrayed and acting that way. \n\nBut some might argue that he's being controlling by not allowing her to leave if she's not paying rent. Wait, he says she can go, but without his home. So he's giving her an ultimatum: leave the apartment. Since she's not paying rent, he can ask her to leave. But does that make him an asshole? Maybe. Because ending a relationship by making the other person leave might be seen as harsh, even if he's technically right. \n\nAlternatively, since they were in a serious relationship, living together, and she's not paying rent, he might have an obligation to let her stay, but if she's not contributing, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key is that the main problem was her lack of communication. He had every right to be upset, but his solution was to end things by evicting her. Whether that's right or wrong... Well, maybe he's not in the wrong because she broke trust by not telling him, and he stood his ground. But others might see his reaction as too extreme. \n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because she was violating trust by not communicating, and he had the right to ask her to leave since she's not paying rent. However, the way he framed it as a breakup by kicking her out might be seen as harsh, but legally and in terms of the apartment, he's in the right.\n"
