Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up with a girlfriend after she planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They were a 3-year couple living in an apartment where the author pays for everything. They have a trust-based relationship because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him, arguing that he wouldn't agree. The author didn't know until 5 days before she was leaving. He told her she could leave instead of staying in his house, which she did, moving to her parents.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author is a guy who pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend didn't pay for it. The trip was planned months in advance but was a surprise. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a big step. He says he offered money for a hotel, which she refused. The girlfriend claims she wanted to go on the trip to \"discover herself,\" which the author didn't like. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If she had told him earlier, maybe they could have discussed it. But she didn't, possibly anticipating his disapproval. The author's response was to end the relationship and have her leave the apartment. Since she wasn't paying for the apartment, he had the right to ask her to leave, but does that make it right in a relationship sense?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't deserve to stay because she wasn't contributing to the apartment. However, the emotional aspect matters. Ending a relationship over an unannounced trip, especially if it's a surprise, could be seen as harsh. The author might be reacting to a breach of communication rather than the trip itself. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's decision to go solo might have been a deal-breaker for him. Maybe he felt it was a lack of respect or dishonesty. However, if she had told him earlier, maybe he could have supported her or expressed concerns. The fact that she kept it a secret until 5 days before departure could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was immediate and severe. Kicking someone out of the home they've been living in for 3 years is a big move. Even if he's not emotionally invested anymore, was the breakup handled responsibly? The girlfriend might feel blindsided, especially if the argument led to her being asked to leave quickly. \n\nThe author's justification is that she didn't pay for the apartment, so she had no right to stay. Legally, he might have the right, but ethically, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author might have felt betrayed, but reacting by ending the relationship and asking her to leave immediately could be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering the AITA format, usually, the subreddit looks at the actions and the intentions. If the author's main issue was the lack of communication, then the breakup is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out the same day\u2014might be seen as extreme. Also, the girlfriend's actions of not informing him about a major life decision could be a red flag for both parties. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate. Even if he was upset, ending the relationship and asking her to leave immediately might not have been the best approach. He had the legal right to ask her to leave since she didn't pay for the apartment, but in a relationship, such decisions should be handled with more consideration. The fact that he used the apartment ownership as leverage to end the relationship could be seen as using financial power in a personal conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe not. Some might argue that if the lack of communication broke their trust, then the breakup is justified. It's a tough call. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the betrayal of trust. If the relationship required open communication and she violated that, then maybe the breakup is justified. However, the way he ended it by using the apartment as a weapon might still be considered wrong. \n\nHmm. I'm conflicted. But leaning towards A because the immediate and harsh reaction without giving her a chance to explain or resolve the issue might be the issue. Alternatively, if he felt the relationship was over due to the broken trust, then B. \n\nBut given the context that they were big on trust, and her not telling him about a major trip planned for months is a breach of trust. So maybe the author is justified. Wait, but he didn't give her the chance to discuss it. She might have had reasons, like needing to do this trip for her own growth. If he had a discussion instead of immediately ending the relationship, that would be better. But he didn't. \n\nSo the problem is not the breakup per se, but the method. He might have been right to break up if trust was broken, but the way he did it was wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the action of breaking up was justified, then B. If the method was wrong, maybe A. But in AITA, the subreddit usually looks at whether the action is asshole-like. \n\nI think the answer is A, because the author is using the apartment ownership to force the breakup, which is a power play. Even if he was upset, using the living situation to end the relationship might be seen as manipulative. Also, the girlfriend did plan the trip months in advance but kept it a secret, which is also a problem. But the author's reaction is too extreme. So A.\n"
