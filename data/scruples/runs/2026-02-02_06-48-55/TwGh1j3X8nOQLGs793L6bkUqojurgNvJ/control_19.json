Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, context: They're in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment by himself, and they split utilities. She's into traveling, and he's okay with it. But she planned a solo trip across South America, which the guy wasn't happy about. He didn't know about it until three days before she left. He asked to join, but she said it was about discovering herself and that he wouldn't let her go. The argument escalated, and he told her to leave his house. She went to her parents, and people are calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here: The guy paid for the apartment, which is a big deal. She didn't inform him about the trip for months, even though they value trust. He felt she wasn't respecting his input or the trust they built. When he confronted her, she said he wouldn't allow it, and he responded by kicking her out. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. She didn't tell him about the trip for months, which he found out 5 days before she left. That's a big deal, especially if they talk about future plans and trust. But he had the right to be upset. However, his response was to kick her out of the house he pays for. While she didn't pay for the apartment, it's a living arrangement where both are supposed to be in it together. By telling her to leave, maybe he took it too far. Even if he owns the apartment, ending the relationship by forcing her out could be seen as extreme. She had her belongings there, and he offered money for a hotel, but she refused. Maybe he didn't have to be harsh, but the situation is complicated.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which is her fault. She had been planning it for months and kept it a secret. But in a relationship, you should talk about big decisions like that. The guy's reaction was a bit of a shock move. Instead of working through the anger, he decided to end it immediately. That might not be fair either. So there's fault on both sides, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user is looking for A or B. So, considering the facts: She didn't communicate, he didn't handle it well. But the act of breaking up over this might be justified if trust was a big part of their relationship. However, the way he did it\u2014kicking her out\u2014could be seen as controlling, even if he's the one paying for the apartment. People might argue that it's his right to ask her to leave, but the emotional response and the sudden breakup might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if he felt that the lack of trust was a dealbreaker, then maybe he's not wrong. But I think the consensus would be that while she was wrong for not telling him, his response was too extreme. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But maybe not. It's tricky. Let me check similar scenarios. Usually, in such cases, if someone keeps a big secret or doesn't communicate, the other person might be justified in breaking up, but the method of doing so (sudden ejection) could be seen as harsh. So maybe A is correct.\n"
