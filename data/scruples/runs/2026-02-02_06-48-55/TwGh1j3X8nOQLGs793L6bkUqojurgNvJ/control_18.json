Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on a surprise solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. The couple had been together for three years, lived in a two-bedroom apartment paid for entirely by the author. They emphasized trust because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip without telling him, which he found unacceptable, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author mentions they were big on trust, so not communicating a significant life decision like a solo trip might breach that trust. The girlfriend argued she wanted to \"discover herself\" and thought he wouldn't allow it, which suggests she didn't see the need to discuss it. However, in a relationship, major decisions\u2014especially those affecting shared living arrangements\u2014should be discussed openly.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out of the apartment, which he owns. Since she didn't pay for it, he might have the legal right to ask her to leave, but the emotional aspect is different. Ending the relationship over this might be seen as a reaction to the lack of communication rather than the trip itself. \n\nBut was the timing and manner of the breakup appropriate? He gave her an ultimatum during an argument, which can be seen as impulsive. The fact that he offered money for a hotel shows he wasn't being cruel, but the decision to end things so abruptly might have been harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't inform him about a trip she had been planning for months, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author had to make a decision about his living situation and boundaries. However, a mature approach might involve discussing the issue and finding a compromise instead of immediate separation.\n\nIn relationships, especially where there's a clear power imbalance in finances (like one person paying the rent), communication is crucial. The author might feel his boundaries were crossed, but the way he handled it could be seen as controlling because he used the living situation as leverage. \n\nOverall, while the girlfriend's lack of communication was problematic, the author's response might be seen as excessive. Ending the relationship over a disagreement, even a big one, without trying to resolve it could place the blame on him. The key is whether the breakup was a justified response to a breach of trust or an overreaction.\n"
