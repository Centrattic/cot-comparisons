Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend going on a solo backpacking trip without telling her partner, who then dumps her because she didn't communicate her plans.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years, and the guy pays for the apartment. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she decided to do without telling him, saying she wanted to \"discover herself.\" The guy didn't know about it until she told him five days before she left. He asked to come with her, she said no, and then he kicked her out of the house, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments for both sides.\n\nOn the guy's side: He pays for the apartment, and they both have a history of trust issues. The girlfriend's sudden decision to leave for a solo trip might have felt like a betrayal. He might have felt that not discussing such a major life decision was a breach of trust. By kicking her out, he's asserting that if she can't be honest and communicate, he can't be in the relationship. He even offered to help with money for a hotel, so he wasn't being entirely cold.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She had been planning this trip for months and wanted to do it alone for self-discovery. She might have thought he wouldn't support her decision. Maybe she felt the need to do it on her own. However, not informing him about such a significant plan, especially when they value trust, is a problem. The fact that she was leaving for a while without telling him could be seen as a lack of communication and respect for their relationship's foundation.\n\nThe guy's reaction is extreme\u2014kicking her out and ending the relationship. While the lack of communication from the girlfriend is a major issue, the way he handled it might be too harsh. Ending the relationship over a disagreement without discussion could be seen as impulsive. However, given their history of valuing trust and the fact that the apartment was his and she wasn't contributing financially, maybe he felt justified in his decision.\n\nBut was it the right thing to do? Breaking up over a disagreement without giving her a chance to explain or resolve the issue might be hasty. However, if the trust is broken and they can't talk about important decisions, then maybe the relationship wasn't sustainable. The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions were a betrayal of trust, which they had valued so much. If she didn't communicate her plans, that could be a deal-breaker for him. The guy might feel that if she can't be honest about something big, the relationship isn't worth continuing.\n\nBut the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately with an ultimatum\u2014could be seen as controlling or extreme. Even if he was angry, giving her an ultimatum and ending the relationship might have been too sudden. However, the user states that he was willing to let her stay if she paid her share, which he says she does through a meter. The fact that he offered to help with hotel money shows he wasn't trying to be cruel, but the act of kicking her out might be seen as harsh regardless.\n\nIn the end, the main factors are communication and trust. The girlfriend failed to communicate a major plan, which was a problem given their emphasis on trust. The guy's reaction, while intense, might be a consequence of that broken trust. But the method of ending the relationship could be seen as too abrupt. However, in the context of their values, maybe it was a justified action for him to take.\n"
