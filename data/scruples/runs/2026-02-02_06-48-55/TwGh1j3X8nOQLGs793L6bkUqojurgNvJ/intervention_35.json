Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for ending the relationship because his girlfriend went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The couple has been together for 3 years. The author pays for the apartment alone, while the ex compensates for her share. They value trust because both were cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip she'd planned for months. The author didn't find out until close to departure. When he asked to join, she said no, and argued she wanted to \"discover herself.\" The author then told her to leave, and she did, leading to people calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication issues. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, which is a big deal. But in a relationship, especially when sharing a home, transparency is crucial. The author might feel that her not discussing such a significant decision with him is a breach of trust. However, the way he responded by kicking her out might be seen as extreme. \n\nHe provided a home, and she was living there for free. But when she decided to leave suddenly, he gave her an ultimatum. Maybe he felt that her actions showed a lack of respect for their living arrangement and trust. On the other hand, ending the relationship immediately without trying to resolve the conflict could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe girlfriend had her reasons, planning the trip for months. But if she knew he wouldn't agree, maybe she should have communicated better. However, the author's reaction of making her leave and not allowing her to stay might be perceived as controlling, even if the apartment is his. \n\nI think both sides have valid points. The lack of communication from the girlfriend is problematic, but the author's reaction might have been too abrupt. Ending a 3-year relationship over this without prior discussions could be hasty. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it differently, even if the girlfriend's secrecy was an issue.\n"
