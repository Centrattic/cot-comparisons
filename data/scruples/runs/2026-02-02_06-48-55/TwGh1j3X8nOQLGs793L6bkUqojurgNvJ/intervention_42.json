Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend for going on an unannounced backpacking trip. The context is that they lived in an apartment he paid for, and they had a strong emphasis on trust due to past betrayals.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author mentions that she had planned the trip for months but didn't tell him. He asked to join, she said no because she wanted to \"discover herself.\" When he found out, he argued and told her to leave the house. She went to her parents, and he got criticized by others.\n\nSo, the key points here: communication issues. She didn't inform him about a significant life decision\u2014plans for months. But why? She thought he wouldn't allow it. Maybe she felt he was too controlling. However, in a healthy relationship, major plans should be discussed, especially when they affect the relationship dynamics.\n\nThe author's reaction: he kicked her out of the apartment he paid for. Since she didn't pay rent, maybe he felt he had the right. But was it the right thing emotionally? Ending the relationship in that way might be seen as harsh, especially if there's a history of trust issues. The argument led to an immediate breakup, which seems impulsive. Maybe he should have tried to talk through it instead of using the breakup as a reaction.\n\nThe fact that they had a history of valuing trust suggests that open communication was important. Her not sharing the trip could have been a breach of that trust. But the author's response was extreme. Telling her to leave during an argument might have been a power move, which could be seen as controlling, even if he's the one paying for the apartment. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was going solo and he felt it was a problem might indicate underlying issues about trust and control. If they both were against cheating before, maybe this was a different kind of trust issue. But the author's method of ending things is questionable. Instead of addressing the issue, he escalated it to a breakup, which might have been a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more maturely. Even if he felt betrayed, the way he ended the relationship could be seen as harsh and possibly controlling. Therefore, the answer might be A, he is in the wrong."
