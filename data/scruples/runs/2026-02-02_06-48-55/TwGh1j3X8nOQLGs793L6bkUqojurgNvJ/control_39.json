Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend ending the relationship because his girlfriend went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The key points here are the financial arrangement, the trust aspect, and the way the breakup was handled.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend covers the apartment costs entirely. The girlfriend compensates him for her share of expenses, which makes sense. They've emphasized trust, which is crucial after past betrayals. The girlfriend wanted to go on a trip she had planned for months, but didn't tell him until last minute. She claims he wouldn't have approved her going alone, which is true because he said he wouldn't let her go. \n\nThe argument led to him telling her to leave the house, which she did, moving to her parents. He offered a hotel for a week, which she refused. Now people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. In a healthy relationship, communication is key, especially about major plans like a solo trip that affects the living situation. The girlfriend didn't inform him until 5 days before, even though it's a significant commitment. That's a breach of trust, as they both value it. But the boyfriend's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. While he pays for the apartment, that doesn't mean she can't have the right to be in it. Ending a 3-year relationship over this might be a heavy reaction. \n\nThe problem is whether his reaction was justified. She didn't ask for permission, but he might have used the financial arrangement to control her. However, if they were in a serious relationship, expecting to live together, not informing about a major life decision like a solo trip could be a deal-breaker. The way he phrased the ultimatum might come off as controlling, but maybe he felt it was necessary to enforce boundaries. \n\nAlso, considering they both wanted to avoid past issues, sudden decisions might trigger insecurities. But instead of discussing it, he resorted to ending things. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe he had a right to be upset about the lack of communication, but the method of breaking up was abrupt. The answer might be A, he's in the wrong for being controlling, but others might see it as her betrayal. However, given the context of trust and mutual communication being important, his reaction seems excessive. So the answer is A.\n"
