Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, some context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for their apartment, and they split expenses. She wanted to take a solo trip across South America, which she had planned for months. He didn't know about it and got upset. They argued, he told her to leave, and now people are calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, key points here. Trust is a big deal for them because both have been cheated on before. The author mentions that they're open about their lives and future plans. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, even though he asked to join and she said he wouldn't approve. The author then kicked her out, saying she could leave since she doesn't pay for the apartment.\n\nHmm, the girlfriend had the right to travel, but didn't communicate it. The author felt betrayed because of the lack of communication. But maybe he overreacted by kicking her out? Since he's the one paying for the apartment, he might have the legal right to ask her to leave, but emotionally, that's a big move. Also, they were in a committed relationship, so living together implies shared responsibilities and communication. Not telling him about a major trip might be a breach of trust, even if he was controlling in his reaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't pay for the apartment, so she can leave. But in a relationship, even if one person pays for the place, it's usually a shared home. Kicking her out over a disagreement might be too harsh. Also, the girlfriend's actions might have been a way to assert her independence, which is understandable, but she should have communicated better.\n\nThe author's response was to end the relationship and kick her out. Whether that's justified depends on their communication and expectations. If they had agreed on communication about travel plans, then she breaking that could be a problem. But if there was no prior agreement, maybe he was too controlling. However, given their history of cheating, trust is crucial. Not informing him might have broken that trust, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He handled it poorly by immediately kicking her out, which could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which is also a problem. But in the context of their relationship dynamics, maybe he felt justified. But the method of ending the relationship might be seen as harsh. I'm leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because the response was extreme and not addressing the issue through communication, but maybe B (not in the wrong) because he was standing up for his boundaries. Hmm. The user is asking for a judgment between A and B. Considering that the author chose to end the relationship abruptly without trying to resolve the conflict, which might be seen as wrong. So answer A.\n"
