Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend have been together for three years. He pays for the apartment, and they split the utilities. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, which he found out only a few days before she was leaving. He got upset and kicked her out of the house, leading her to go stay with her parents. Now he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The apartment is his, he pays for it, and she's there as a roommate. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She wanted to go on this solo trip, which he didn't know about until it was almost time. He offered to let her come with him, but she said she wanted to do it alone. When he tried to argue, he said she could leave the house if she wanted to go, which she did. Then people called him a controlling asshole, so he's confused.\n\nNow, thinking about his actions. He didn't force her to leave; he told her she could leave if she wanted to go on the trip. Since the apartment is his and he's the one paying, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not contributing financially. But relationships usually require communication. She had planned this for months and didn't tell him, which could be a breach of trust since they value trust a lot. But on the other hand, he didn't handle it well. Instead of talking it through, he immediately kicked her out, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nHe mentions that she didn't have the right to demand to stay, which is true because she's not paying rent. But dumping her without a place to stay (even though he offered a week's hotel stay, which she refused) seems a bit extreme. Even if she's not paying rent, ending a relationship by kicking someone out might be too much. Also, she went to her parents, so maybe she had a place to go, but the way he handled it could be seen as controlling, especially if he's using the apartment as leverage.\n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, both partners should communicate major life decisions, especially ones that affect the other. Her not telling him about the trip could be a big deal, especially if they had plans together or if this affects their future. But he also didn't give her a chance to explain further. He just told her to leave if she wanted to go. That's not exactly a mature way to handle conflict. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he might have a point about the apartment and her not contributing, but the way he reacted by kicking her out immediately could be seen as overreacting. Ending a relationship this way, especially by removing her from their home, might be too harsh. The fact that he didn't try to work it out but instead used the apartment as a threat might make him look controlling, even if he's not paying for everything. \n\nOn the other hand, she did keep a major decision from him, which could be a breach of trust. But since they value trust, not communicating this trip might be a problem on her side. However, the way he responded is still problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because he used the apartment as leverage to end the relationship, which could be seen as controlling and not a healthy way to handle the situation. Even if she's not paying rent, the approach he took was extreme and not constructive. Alternatively, if he's entitled to ask her to leave because she's not paying, then maybe he's not in the wrong (B). But given that this is a relationship, not just roommates, using the apartment as a way to end the relationship might be inappropriate.\n"
