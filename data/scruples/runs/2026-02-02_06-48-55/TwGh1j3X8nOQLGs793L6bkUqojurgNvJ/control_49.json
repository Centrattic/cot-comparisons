Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The situation involves a three-year relationship where the man pays for the apartment, and the ex wanted to go on a trip without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They lived in a 2-bedroom apartment, which he paid for by himself. She contributed by covering her part of the utilities. They both value trust because of past issues with cheating. The key event is that she planned a solo trip for months without telling him, and when he found out, he kicked her out. \n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here. \n\nHe paid for the apartment, so maybe he felt he had the right to set boundaries. She went on a trip without telling him, which might be a breach of trust. They mentioned being big on trust. However, she did say she planned it for months and that he wouldn't have allowed it. He responded by telling her to leave, which seems harsh. \n\nIs there a mutual understanding about communication? Maybe they didn't discuss future plans or expectations for such trips. If he didn't know about the trip until last minute, that could be a problem. But if she had been planning it for months and didn't communicate, that's an issue. \n\nHe offered to pay for a hotel if she needed, which shows he was trying to be reasonable. She left to stay with her parents. The people around him are calling him a controlling asshole, but maybe that's because of the way he handled it. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If she didn't talk to him about this major life decision, that's a problem. But breaking up over it might be an overreaction. However, considering they both value trust, maybe the lack of communication was a red flag. \n\nHe might feel that the trust was broken because she didn't share her plans. But dumping her immediately after an argument could be seen as impulsive. The fact that she had been planning it for months and didn't mention it could justify his actions if trust was a cornerstone. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out of a shared home over a disagreement is a significant step. Even if he owns the apartment, the emotional aspect matters. Relationships require compromise, and maybe there was a way to resolve it without breaking up. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If trust was a foundation and she didn't communicate, he might feel justified. But the method of breaking up by kicking her out could be seen as extreme. However, considering the context of trust and her not informing him, it's a valid reason for him. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because of the trust issues and her not communicating the trip. But others might see it as A because of the abrupt breakup. However, given the emphasis on trust and mutual communication in their relationship, his reaction might be seen as a consequence of broken trust. So, B.\n"
