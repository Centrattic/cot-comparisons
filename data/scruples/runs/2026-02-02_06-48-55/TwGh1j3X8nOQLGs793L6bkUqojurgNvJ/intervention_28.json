Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together three years, living in an apartment the author pays for. They value trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she hadn't told him about. He asked to join, but she said no. He then told her to leave, and she did, going to her parents' house. The author is questioning if he was an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend had been planning the trip for months but didn't tell him. The author felt betrayed because she didn't share this important life decision. However, the author's response was to kick her out of their home, which he solely pays for. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author's reaction might be seen as extreme. Ending a relationship over a disagreement, especially with an ultimatum, can be harsh. \n\nThe apartment situation is a factor. The author pays for it, so she doesn't have a financial stake. But they've lived together for three years, so this isn't just a matter of roommates. His decision to remove her because she didn't contribute financially might be seen as using the living arrangement as leverage in the emotional conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that she didn't have the right to stay because she didn't pay for the apartment seems a bit cold. While it's his financial responsibility, they're in a committed relationship, so her living situation is intertwined with their relationship. Using the apartment as a way to force her out could be seen as manipulative or controlling, even if he wasn't holding her there financially.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip isn't inherently wrong. People do these trips for self-discovery. But not communicating it to a partner, especially when there's a history of trust issues, could be problematic. However, the author's response of immediately kicking her out and ending the relationship might be overreacting. \n\nThe author's main argument is that he wanted trust and communication. By not telling him about the trip, she broke that trust. But breaking up over it without giving her a chance to explain or resolve the issue might not be fair. The ultimatum could be seen as an emotional reaction rather than a mature resolution. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author felt betrayed, but his method of addressing it by ending the relationship abruptly might not address the underlying issues. Maybe a discussion about boundaries and expectations for future trips could have been better. Instead, he used the apartment as a bargaining chip, which complicates the emotional aspect with financial control.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because he escalated the situation by removing her from their shared home as a punishment, which is a harsh measure even if he's the one paying for it. The use of financial leverage in a personal conflict can be perceived as controlling behavior, especially in a relationship where trust is already a big concern.\n"
