Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, they were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment, and she helps with the utilities. They value trust a lot, both having been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. He wanted to come, but she said it was for self-discovery. When he tried to argue, he told her she could leave if she wanted, and she did, going to her parents' house. Now he's questioning if he was an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a significant life decision, even though they had open communication and future plans. The fact that they value trust is important. But she didn't ask for permission, just gave a reason why he wouldn't have wanted her to go. The author's reaction was to tell her to leave, which led to the breakup.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should discuss big decisions. The girlfriend's secret planning is a problem, but the author's response of kicking her out might be overly harsh. Ending the relationship over a disagreement about a trip, especially when the trip itself is legal and her choice, might be seen as extreme. The author's justification is that she didn't pay for the apartment, so she doesn't have a right to stay, but they were in a committed relationship. Evicting a partner is not typical, even if there's financial disparity. The author could have tried to negotiate or set boundaries without ending the relationship. So maybe he's in the wrong because the breakup was a drastic reaction to a communication issue without considering other options. But others might argue that if trust is a cornerstone and she broke that by hiding plans, then he's justified. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the author's action of making her leave immediately might be seen as harsh, hence A (author is in the wrong).\n"
