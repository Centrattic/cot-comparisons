Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The guy had been paying for the apartment, and when she told him she was going, he kicked her out because he felt she didn't need his permission or the security of his home. People are calling him controlling, and he's wondering if he is indeed an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was in a 3-year relationship. They lived together in an apartment he paid for, with her compensating him for her share. They both had a history of being cheated on and placed a lot of trust in each other. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't inform him. When he asked why, she said he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her to leave, and she did, going to her parents' house. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nSo, the main issue is about communication. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the trip, which he found out 5 days before she left. The guy then decided to end the relationship by kicking her out. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nFactors to consider: Trust is a big part of their relationship. She might have withheld the trip to avoid conflict, but not communicating such a significant decision could erode trust. The guy's argument was that since he's the one paying for the apartment, she didn't have the right to demand to stay. However, even if he pays for the apartment, it's their shared home, and suddenly kicking someone out after an argument might be seen as extreme, especially if it's a result of hurt feelings over the trip not being discussed.\n\nAlso, the method he used\u2014\"kicking her out\"\u2014might be problematic. Instead of confronting the issue and discussing it, he escalated the conflict by ending the relationship in that moment. People might see this as an overreaction, even if he felt justified. The girlfriend's desire to travel solo is a personal choice, and while they had a history of trust issues, she might have thought she was protecting the relationship by not bringing it up until later. However, keeping a major life decision secret for months and then announcing it right before leaving could be seen as disrespectful, especially given the emphasis they placed on trust.\n\nBut the guy's response was abrupt. Ending a 3-year relationship because she didn't inform him about a planned trip, even if he felt it was a betrayal, might be considered too harsh. It's possible that a more constructive approach would have been better, like discussing their concerns and finding a compromise. The key here is whether the lack of communication was a deal-breaker or if his reaction was disproportionate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If trust was a cornerstone, not discussing such a significant trip could indeed be a breach of trust. However, the way he ended things could be seen as controlling if he used the apartment's ownership as leverage. The moral of the story might be that both parties have responsibilities in maintaining open communication, but the sudden breakup might have been a reaction based on emotions rather than a rational decision. \n\nSo, the guy might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more calmly and for using the apartment situation to end the relationship, even if the lack of communication was an issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend also didn't communicate her plans, which could be a problem. But since the question is about the author (the guy), the answer hinges on whether his action was justified. Given the context, his reaction seems harsh, so I'd lean towards A, he's in the wrong.\n"
