Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her unannounced backpacking trip. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The couple has been together for three years. The guy pays for the apartment, which she doesn't contribute to directly, but she covers her share through a meter. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, didn't tell him until a few days before, and he kicked her out. Now, people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points: communication breakdown. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, which he found out about 5 days before she left. They had a big argument, and he decided to end the relationship by kicking her out. The guy's reasoning is that since he pays for the apartment, she had no right to demand staying, and he offered to help with a hotel, which she refused.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, especially in long-term partnerships, communication is crucial. If one partner makes a significant life decision (like a solo trip) without discussing it, that can be a red flag. However, the guy's response was to end the relationship by making her leave the apartment. That seems harsh. Even if he was upset, the act of evicting her immediately might be over the top, especially since they were in a 2-bedroom apartment, and she might not have had immediate alternative plans. The fact that he offered a hotel for a week is a middle ground, but she refused. Maybe he should have given her more time to find another place or discussed it more calmly. \n\nBut then, their dynamic is such that he pays for the apartment. That could create power imbalance. If she's not contributing directly, maybe he felt it was a way to enforce accountability. However, in a relationship, both parties should have input on major decisions. Her not informing him about a trip that she had planned for months is a big deal. But the way he reacted\u2014ending the relationship by making her leave immediately\u2014might be the issue here. \n\nAlso, people calling him a controlling asshole: that's a strong term. But controlling behavior could involve not allowing her to go on trips. However, the line is thin. If he's the one paying, maybe he feels it's his decision to allow her to stay. But in a relationship, mutual respect and communication should be key. If he didn't want her to go, the better approach might have been to discuss it, maybe express concerns about her safety or the impact on their relationship, but not to use eviction as a punishment. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His actions were a response to her dishonesty, but the method of response (immediate breakup and eviction) seems extreme. In a healthy relationship, even if there's a major disagreement, you don't just kick someone out. That's more of a controlling or punitive reaction. So, he might be in the wrong for how he handled it, even if her not telling him was a mistake. The appropriate action would be to talk through it, maybe set boundaries, rather than immediately ending the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction was disproportionate. Even if the girlfriend made a mistake, the way he handled it was harsh and not a constructive resolution.\n"
