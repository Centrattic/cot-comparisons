Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation involves several factors.\n\nFirst, the couple lived in an apartment that the author paid for, and he didn't make her pay rent because he felt it was his responsibility. She was planning a solo trip, which he didn't know about until she told him five days before departure. He asked to join, but she refused, saying it was for self-discovery. He felt she should have discussed it with him earlier, and when she didn't, he kicked her out, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Key points: communication, trust, and financial responsibility. The couple had a history of valuing trust, so maybe the lack of communication is on her. However, the author's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. She didn't pay for the apartment, so maybe he had the right to ask her to leave if she wasn't contributing. But was the breakup justified? The author's reaction was immediate and extreme, possibly overreacting. The fact that she had planned it for months but didn't tell him earlier is a problem, but his response might be too harsh. The main issue is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to her actions. The author might feel betrayed, but the decision to end the relationship was abrupt. So, considering both parties' responsibilities, the author's reaction might be inconsiderate, but maybe she was also at fault for not communicating. However, the act of kicking her out and ending the relationship seems disproportionate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the response was too harsh and didn't address the underlying issues through communication.\n"
