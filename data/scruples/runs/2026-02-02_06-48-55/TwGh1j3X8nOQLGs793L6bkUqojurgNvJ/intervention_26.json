Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without informing her partner. The author, who pays for their apartment, kicked her out after she decided to go on the trip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend didn't inform the author about the trip, which he found out last minute. He asked to join, but she refused, saying he wouldn't allow it. The argument escalated, and he told her she can leave if she wants. She took the offer and left, then people criticized him.\n\nThe apartment situation is important. The author pays for it, and the girlfriend compensates him. So, the apartment is his responsibility. If she's not paying, maybe he has the right to decide who stays there. But relationships require mutual respect and trust. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. However, the surprise trip without discussion is a problem. \n\nThe author's action of kicking her out might be seen as a reaction to her breaking trust. But was it necessary? He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. Maybe he didn't have to be so harsh. However, since he's the one paying for the apartment, he might feel he can set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's lack of communication about a significant trip is a red flag. She had planned it for months but kept it secret. That could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to feeling disrespected. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners should discuss major life plans. The girlfriend should have talked about the trip earlier. The author's reaction was extreme, but maybe he felt justified. However, threatening to kick someone out of the house because of a disagreement is a big step. It might be seen as controlling, especially if the person isn't paying rent. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because using the apartment situation as leverage in a disagreement could be seen as unfair. Even if she wasn't paying rent, the way he handled it could be harsh. But if the apartment is his to manage, he has some right. It's a tough call. The main issue is the lack of communication from her side, but his response was abrupt. Maybe he could have handled it differently. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he used the apartment as a weapon in the argument, which is controlling behavior. Even though she didn't pay rent, the way he reacted was extreme.\n"
