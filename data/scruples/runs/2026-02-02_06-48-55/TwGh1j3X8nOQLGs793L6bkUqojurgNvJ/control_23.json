Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America and told him about it only a few days before leaving. The author, who pays for the apartment, kicked her out because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a 3-year relationship, and trust is important to both. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share. The trip was a surprise, and she said he wouldn't allow her to go if he knew. He responded by telling her to leave, which she did, going to her parents' house. People criticized him as controlling.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did he have a right to kick her out? Well, if they live together in his apartment, and he's the one paying, maybe he has the right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing? But on the other hand, ending a relationship over a planned trip that she had been working on for months might be a big reaction. Did they discuss travel plans before? The story says they were big on trust and future plans, so maybe she thought she could go on trips without prior notice. But the surprise aspect and the short notice could be an issue.\n\nHe argues that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she didn't have the right to stay. But that's a bit cold. Relationships involve shared living arrangements even if one person pays. Also, she had been planning this for months but only told him days before. That lack of communication is a problem. His reaction was immediate and harsh, leading to her leaving. Maybe he overreacted, but maybe he felt betrayed because of the secrecy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is her not communicating about a major life decision, then he might have a point. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out with an ultimatum\u2014could be seen as too drastic. Also, considering their history of trust issues, this might have triggered his need for control. On the flip side, if he's the one paying, maybe he felt justified. However, relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. Ending it over this might be a valid choice if it's about differing priorities, but the method of doing it could be questionable.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. The author might be in the right if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, but his immediate decision to end things might be seen as extreme. Conversely, the girlfriend had prior plans and didn't discuss them, which isn't ideal. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since he's the one taking the action, the question is whether he's the asshole. The community's reaction (people calling him an asshole) suggests that some might think he's wrong. However, his reasoning is based on his terms of trust and living arrangements. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author's action, while perhaps justified in his eyes, might be seen as too harsh, making him the asshole. But then again, if the relationship was built on trust and communication, her secretiveness is a problem. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But considering that he ended it unilaterally and she left, maybe the author's approach was wrong. A for yes, B for no. I think the answer is A.\n"
