Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, some context: They've been dating for three years. The author lives in a two-bedroom apartment he pays for, and the girlfriend helps with expenses. They both value trust because of past issues. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him until just before it started. She said he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone, which she admitted. The author's response was to tell her to leave the apartment, which he owns, and she moved out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The girlfriend planned a trip for months and didn't inform her partner. Given they emphasized trust and open communication, this seems like a big issue. Trust is a cornerstone in their relationship, so her secrecy could be a valid reason for the author's reaction.\n\n2. The author's decision to ask her to leave the apartment. Since he pays for it, he might feel he has the right to his space. However, since they were living together, this might have been a harsh response. Kicking someone out of the home they share can be seen as a severe action, even if he's the one paying for it. \n\nBut wait, the apartment is his, and he's the one covering the rent. If she's not contributing financially, maybe he's justified in his stance. However, the breakup happened quickly after an argument. The way he handled it might come off as controlling, especially since she had her reasons for not informing him. \n\nThe girlfriend's secrecy and the author's immediate decision to end things by asking her to leave are both points to consider. The author might feel betrayed, but his response might be too extreme. The girlfriend could argue she has the right to her independence, but the lack of communication was a major problem. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, open communication is key. The fact that she didn't discuss the trip for months could be a breach of trust. However, the author's reaction of ending the relationship without giving her a chance to explain further could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole is a red flag. While trust is important, reacting with such a drastic measure might not be proportionate. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more dialogue and support instead of immediate confrontation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because his response was extreme and potentially controlling, even if the girlfriend's secrecy was an issue. The right approach would be to address the communication problem without resorting to eviction.\n"
