Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. They lived in an apartment the author paid for, and the girlfriend was going on a solo trip she had planned for months. The author asked to join but she refused, saying he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to the author telling her to leave, which she did, staying with her parents. Now, people are calling him controlling, and he's unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the financial arrangement, the level of trust they emphasized, the surprise trip, and the author's reaction. The apartment is his, she doesn't pay for it, and he offered to help with a hotel. He says he was willing to give her money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, which he found out only days before. The author felt it was a betrayal of trust, especially since they both valued trust highly. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014might come off as harsh, even if the apartment is his. The girlfriend's right to her autonomy and the author's right to set boundaries are in conflict here.\n\nLegally, since the apartment is his and she doesn't pay rent, she might not have a right to stay. But emotionally, the situation is more nuanced. The author's reaction could be seen as extreme, especially if the relationship was healthy before this. Ending a relationship over a disagreement about travel plans, even if there's a financial component, might be seen as a choice to part ways rather than a wrong. However, the method of ending it\u2014saying she can leave because she doesn't pay for the apartment\u2014could be perceived as using financial power to control the situation, which is a red flag in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, if trust was a cornerstone of their relationship and she withheld significant plans, the author might feel justified in ending things. But the abruptness and the manner in which he told her to leave might be viewed as overly controlling. People often see sudden relationship endings as a sign of manipulation or control if one partner holds a significant financial advantage.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not be in the wrong if he and his girlfriend had mutual understanding about the apartment and finances. However, the way he ended it without attempting to resolve the issue together, instead using the financial arrangement as leverage, could be seen as wrong. It's a tricky balance between personal autonomy, financial responsibility, and relationship dynamics. The author's decision to end the relationship was his choice, but the method and reasoning might be where he's in the wrong.\n"
