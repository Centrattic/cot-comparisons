Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context they provided. They've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, and they both emphasize trust because they've been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until the last minute. He wanted to come, but she said she wanted to \"discover herself\" alone. When he objected, he told her she could leave and stay in a hotel, which she did. He's now being called an asshole by people, and he's uncertain if he was right to kick her out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend had plans for months, didn't communicate with him about it until last minute, he felt it was a breach of trust, and he ended the relationship by asking her to leave. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be seen as something she wanted to do for herself, which is understandable. However, not informing her partner about such a significant plan, especially when they live together and the apartment is paid for by him, could be a problem. He might feel that her secrecy and lack of communication were issues, especially given their emphasis on trust. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend had the right to her own independence and personal growth. Maybe she felt that she needed to take this trip for her own reasons, and the fact that she had planned it for months could mean she thought it was important. However, not discussing it with her partner beforehand could be a mistake, especially since they live together and the arrangement is that he covers the apartment costs. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a drastic step. Ending a relationship over a disagreement about a trip might be seen as overreacting. But considering their history of cheating and the importance they placed on trust, maybe the lack of communication was a red flag he couldn't overlook. \n\nThe apartment situation complicates things. He pays for it, and she's not contributing financially. If she's going to be away for an extended period, maybe he felt it was no longer fair to pay for an extra room she's not using. However, he offered to pay for a hotel, which she refused. That seems like he tried to be accommodating. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, major decisions, especially those affecting shared living arrangements, should be discussed. Her not communicating could be a breach of trust, but his reaction might be too harsh. Ending a three-year relationship over this seems extreme. However, if trust is the foundation and communication is broken, maybe it's a justified decision. \n\nI think the author's actions are a matter of perspective. If the core of the relationship was built on honesty and they had previous issues with trust, then her not discussing the trip could be a deal-breaker. But if she had a valid reason to go solo and it was planned in good faith, then his reaction might be too harsh. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because ending a long-term relationship over a disagreement about a planned trip, even with lack of communication, might be an overreaction. However, the lack of communication from the girlfriend is also a problem. But since the question is about the author's actions, kicking her out after an argument over a last-minute announcement could be seen as too extreme. So, answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nWait, maybe the key is whether the trip was a breach of their agreed-upon trust. They both valued trust, and she didn't communicate. If he felt that her secrecy was a violation, then maybe he's justified. But the way he handled it might be the issue. Instead of working through the problem, he ended the relationship immediately. So, maybe answer A because he could have handled it differently, but B if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker. It's tricky. I think the answer is A because breaking up over this without maybe trying to resolve it first is harsh. But there's a lot to consider here. I'm a bit torn, but I think the answer is A.\n"
