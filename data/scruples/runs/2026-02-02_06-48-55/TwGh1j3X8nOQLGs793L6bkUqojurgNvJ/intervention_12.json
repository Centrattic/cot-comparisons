Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America without telling her boyfriend, who pays for the apartment. He kicked her out because he felt she hadn't communicated this plan and didn't want to support her going alone.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend had been planning this for months but didn't tell him until right before the trip. That's a big deal because they've always been open with each other. Maybe she thought he would object, but keeping such a significant decision secret for months isn't great. \n\nThen, the argument where she says she wants to \"discover herself\" and he responds by kicking her out. The apartment is his, and she doesn't pay rent, so he might feel he has the right to ask her to leave. But the way he handled it\u2014during an argument\u2014could be seen as harsh. He offered to pay for a hotel, but she refused, which complicates things.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as controlling if he's using housing as leverage. Even though he pays for the apartment, relationships require mutual respect and communication. Ending the relationship over a disagreement about a trip might be extreme, especially if the main issue was lack of communication rather than safety. She was traveling alone, which could be a concern, but if they have trust issues from past relationships, this might have escalated tensions.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't share her plans, which could be a breach of trust. But ending the relationship by kicking her out during an argument might have been impulsive. The fact that others called him a controlling asshole suggests that his method of ending the relationship was seen as overly harsh, even if the underlying issue had validity.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author is in the wrong for how he handled the situation, using housing as a punishment during an argument. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, but the response seems disproportionate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
