Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, context is important. They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment himself, and she compensates him for her share of the utilities. They value trust, especially because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she had been thinking about for months but didn't tell him until five days before she was supposed to leave. When he asked to join or at least be informed, she said she needed to do it alone and that she didn't tell him because he wouldn't have let her. The author then told her to leave the house, which she did, and now he's questioning if he was right to do that.\n\nNow, considering the key points here: communication, trust, and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which is a big deal in a relationship, especially when it involves being away for an extended period. However, she did mention she had been planning it for months, which might mean she had her reasons for not telling him earlier. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme. The apartment is his, and she wasn't paying rent, so he could legally ask her to leave, but emotionally, is that the right move?\n\nTrust was a cornerstone of their relationship. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be seen as a breach of trust because she didn't communicate her intentions. On the flip side, the author's response of evicting her could be seen as a violation of trust and emotional manipulation. He used the apartment (which he owns) as leverage in their relationship, which is a red flag. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and communication, not using financial or living situations as ultimatums.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasons for not telling him\u2014she thought he wouldn't support her\u2014might indicate a lack of communication. But it's not an excuse. She should have discussed it with him, even if there was potential conflict. The author's reaction was to remove her from his home, which is a significant action. While he might feel justified because she wasn't contributing to the rent, the way he handled the breakup by evicting her instead of discussing it calmly shows poor conflict resolution skills.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have some fault. The girlfriend didn't communicate, but the author's response was harsh. However, the core issue here is the author's use of the apartment as leverage. Even though he owns the apartment, using it as a way to enforce his will in the relationship is problematic. Healthy relationships require negotiation and understanding, not ultimatums based on financial control.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he used their living situation as a manipulative tool rather than addressing the issue through open communication. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, but the author's reaction was disproportionate and self-serving.\n"
