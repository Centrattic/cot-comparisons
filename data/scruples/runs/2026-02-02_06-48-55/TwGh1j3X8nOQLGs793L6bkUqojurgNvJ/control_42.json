Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been together for three years, living in a two-bedroom apartment that the author pays for. The girlfriend compensates him for her share. They value trust, both having been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. When he asked why she didn't inform him, she said he wouldn't have allowed it. The author then told her to leave, and she did. People are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's lack of communication, the author's financial responsibility for the apartment, and the sudden breakup. The author's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she had no right to demand to stay. But does that make sense? \n\nIn a relationship, especially a long-term one, communication is crucial. If she had planned this trip for months, not discussing it with him could be a major issue. However, ending the relationship by kicking her out might be seen as extreme. The author might feel that the lack of communication and the decision to go solo without his input (which he might see as a breach of trust) justified the breakup. But others might see his reaction as harsh, especially since she was just leaving for a trip and it's not like she's abandoning the relationship. The fact that he's the one paying for the apartment complicates things, but the core issue is about trust and communication. \n\nThe author's argument is that the trust was broken by her not informing him, but in a trusting relationship, maybe he should have expressed his concerns earlier if such a trip was a deal-breaker. If he knew she liked traveling and had discussed it before, her sudden planning might have been a red flag. But if he never communicated that he was okay with her traveling, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which could lead to resentment. On the other hand, ending the relationship by kicking her out seems drastic. The author might have handled it better by discussing his feelings instead of immediately breaking up. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But the way he handled it\u2014telling her to leave and not giving her a chance to talk through it\u2014could be seen as controlling or impulsive. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong, because breaking up over a solo trip without prior communication is a harsh reaction. The core issue is communication breakdown, but the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. Unless there were other factors (like repeated breaches of trust), the immediate breakup might be unjustified. So, A.\n"
