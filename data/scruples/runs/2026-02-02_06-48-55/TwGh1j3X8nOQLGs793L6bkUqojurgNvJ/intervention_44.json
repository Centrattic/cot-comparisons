Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her unannounced backpacking trip. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, some context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment alone, and they both value trust a lot. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. He asked to join, but she said no, explaining that he wouldn't allow her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her to leave the apartment she doesn't pay for, and she went to her parents. Then he got criticized as controlling.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, trust, and boundaries. The woman didn't inform him about a major life decision (a months-long trip) that affects their living arrangement. The man, who covers the rent, might feel that her sudden absence could disrupt his plans or finances. But is it right to kick her out of the home she doesn't pay for? \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. Even if she had her reasons, not discussing a significant trip that impacts their shared life could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the man's reaction\u2014telling her to leave the apartment she doesn't own\u2014seems harsh. If they were living together, ending the relationship is one thing, but evicting her from their shared home is another. Even if she doesn't pay rent, it's their home together. Kicking her out without prior notice might be seen as extreme.\n\nAlso, the man's justification is that since she doesn't pay, she has no right to stay. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, it's expected that both partners contribute in other ways. Financial contributions are one aspect, but emotional support and shared responsibilities are part of it too. The fact that he's paying the rent doesn't negate her right to be in the apartment. It might be a point of contention if they're cohabiting without a clear agreement on living arrangements, but that's more about how they manage their finances rather than who can live there.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the man's response could be seen as overreacting. Ending a relationship is difficult, but using the threat of eviction as leverage during an argument could be seen as controlling or manipulative. Offering money for a hotel was a kind gesture, but refusing to let her stay in a shared home without prior notice (especially during a breakup) is problematic.\n\nConsidering their mutual emphasis on trust, the lack of communication from her and the harsh reaction from him both contribute to the conflict. But in terms of who is in the wrong, the man's action of immediately evicting her might be more severe. Relationships require compromise and understanding, but this situation seems more like a breakdown in communication leading to an impulsive decision. The man's response could be perceived as holding power over her by controlling the living situation, which might not align with their trust-based relationship.\n\nSo, while both parties have some faults, the man's action of kicking her out of their shared home seems like a significant misstep. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
