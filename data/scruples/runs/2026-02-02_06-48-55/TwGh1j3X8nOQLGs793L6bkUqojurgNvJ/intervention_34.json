Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend ended the relationship because his girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and he kicked her out of their apartment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They lived together in a 2-bedroom apartment that the boyfriend pays for entirely. The girlfriend wasn't contributing to the rent but compensates through utilities. They have a history of trust issues from past relationships. The girlfriend planned a solo trip without telling him, saying he wouldn't have allowed it. The boyfriend reacted by telling her she could leave and offered money for a hotel, which she refused. Now he's being criticized as controlling.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the boyfriend acted appropriately by breaking up and evicting her over this. Let's consider communication and boundaries. In a relationship, especially a long-term one, open communication is vital. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major life decision, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the boyfriend's reaction of kicking her out and calling it a breakup might be extreme, especially since she didn't pay for the apartment. He did offer financial help, but she declined. Was he being controlling by using the apartment as leverage?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, big decisions like a solo trip should be discussed. If she felt the need to hide it because she thought he'd disapprove, that suggests underlying issues in the relationship. But the boyfriend's response of ending things immediately without trying to resolve the conflict seems harsh. Instead of using the apartment as a bargaining chip, maybe a discussion about why she felt the need to go solo and how to handle future plans together would have been better. \n\nHowever, the user's context mentions that they were big on trust and had been through infidelity before. The girlfriend's deception could be a significant trust issue. But the boyfriend's method of ending the relationship by evicting her might be seen as emotional manipulation, especially since he controls the living situation. People might argue that in a serious relationship, both partners should have mutual respect, and using living arrangements as a punishment could be considered controlling behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, if the apartment was his and she wasn't paying rent, he has the legal right to ask her to leave. But the emotional aspect is different. Ending a 3-year relationship over this without giving her a chance to explain or negotiate might not be fair. Also, the fact that she had been planning it for months adds another layer\u2014maybe there was a communication breakdown where she didn't feel heard. \n\nSo, considering the arguments, the boyfriend did act in a way that could be seen as controlling by using the apartment to make a point. Even though he had the right to ask her to leave, the manner in which he ended the relationship might be inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was excessive and potentially manipulative, despite the initial breach of trust.\n"
