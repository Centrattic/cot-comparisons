Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy paid for the apartment by himself, and they had a trust-based relationship. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and when he found out, he kicked her out. The user is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The apartment is his, and he pays for it. The girlfriend didn't pay rent, so maybe that's a point. But they were in a 3-year relationship, so it's a significant time. The key issue is the unannounced trip. She had been planning it for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. He felt blindsided. \n\nHe says he's fine with her traveling, but she didn't communicate. The fact that she said he wouldn't let her go might indicate a lack of communication. Also, the argument leads to him telling her to leave. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is crucial. If she planned something major without discussing it, that's a problem. However, his reaction was to kick her out of their shared home, even though he paid for it. But if they were living together, even if he paid, it's a shared space, so maybe he overstepped by not allowing her to stay. \n\nAlso, the fact that she went to her parents' house and he got criticized by others for being controlling. Maybe he was angry, but was it justified? The question is about right and wrong. \n\nIf the girlfriend didn't communicate the trip, that's on her. But the author's response was to end the relationship by kicking her out. Is that a reasonable reaction? Maybe not. Because even if she didn't communicate, ending the relationship immediately might be extreme. However, if they were having an argument and he felt it was necessary to set a boundary, perhaps he thought it was the right step. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, if the girlfriend didn't inform him about a major decision, that's a breach of trust. However, the author's response might have been too harsh. Maybe he should have discussed it rather than immediately ending things. \n\nThe user's perspective is that he's not in the wrong because she didn't pay for the apartment and thus didn't have the right to stay. But if they were in a long-term relationship, she might have expected to still live there. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, but the author's reaction might be over the top. However, if the apartment is his and he's the one paying, maybe he has the right to ask her to leave if they break up. But the breakup happened during the argument, so perhaps he's in the wrong for not handling it more calmly. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Ending the relationship and immediately kicking her out might be seen as harsh, even if she didn't communicate. But if they were in a fight and he felt it was the end, maybe he's not wrong. The answer might be B (no) because she was the one who didn't communicate, but the immediate action is questionable. However, in the context of the story, he might feel justified. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong because the main issue was her lack of communication, and he's setting boundaries.\n"
