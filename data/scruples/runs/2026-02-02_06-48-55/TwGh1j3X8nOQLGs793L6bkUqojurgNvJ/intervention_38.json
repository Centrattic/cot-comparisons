Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong after ending the relationship with his girlfriend over an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation as presented. The couple has been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment, which is a two-bedroom. They split the expenses through a shared account and a meter. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which the author didn't know about until five days before she left. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and thought he wouldn't approve. The argument led to the author telling her she can leave, as she didn't pay for the apartment. She went to her parents' house, and now he's being called an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The girlfriend planned a significant trip without informing her partner. \n2. The author kicked her out of the apartment he owns and pays for. \n3. Trust is a big factor in their relationship. \n\nThe author believes he was right because she didn't contribute to the rent and he was willing to help with a hotel. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. In a relationship, communication is crucial. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major decision that could affect their living situation. The author had to pay for the apartment alone, so if she leaves, that's a financial impact. But did he have the right to kick her out? The apartment is his, so he owns it, but she was living there. Ending the relationship is one thing, but evicting her from their shared home might be problematic. \n\nWait, the story says they were big on trust, and she felt he wouldn't allow her to go. Maybe she thought if she told him, he would try to stop her. The author's reaction was to tell her to leave, which could be seen as a knee-jerk response. Even though he pays for the apartment, they were in a relationship, and her staying there was part of their arrangement. If he ended the relationship and she left, that's different, but making her leave immediately might not be fair. \n\nAlso, the timing is five days before the trip. That's pretty short notice. If they were living together, her leaving suddenly could cause logistical issues. The author's action of kicking her out could be seen as extreme. Even if he was upset, maybe a more reasonable approach would be to talk it through instead of terminating the relationship and evicting her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the lack of communication was a betrayal of trust. Since they had been through past issues with cheating, maybe this unannounced trip made him feel insecure or untrusted. But the trip itself isn't about cheating; it's about her personal choice to travel solo. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overreacted. If the girlfriend had a right to her own plans and the author's response was disproportionate, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he felt that her decision was a breach of trust and the living arrangement was part of their relationship, then ending things might be his right. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend and the author's response. For something that's a personal choice (like a solo trip), not discussing it for five days before departure is poor communication. However, the author's reaction of making her leave immediately might be too harsh. Ending a relationship is a big decision, and doing it in the heat of the moment during an argument could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut he owns the apartment and she didn't pay for it. So, he could have the right to ask her to move out eventually, but doing it right after the argument, without giving her time to process or move out on her own, might be the problem. Also, the fact that she had been planning it for months but didn't tell him could be a significant trust issue. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate a major decision. On the other hand, the author's immediate action to kick her out might have been too extreme. The answer would depend on cultural norms and how the relationship was structured. In many places, even if you own the apartment, if the other person is listed on the lease, you can't just evict them without legal process. If she wasn't on the lease, maybe he can, but it's still a sensitive matter. \n\nGiven that, the author's choice to end the relationship and have her leave immediately could be seen as wrong because it's a heavy-handed reaction. The girlfriend should have communicated better, but the author's response might have been too quick and not considering the emotional aspect. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he reacted impulsively and didn't handle it with the necessary care, even though there were valid concerns about communication and trust.\n"
