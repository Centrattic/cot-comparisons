Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, the context is important. They lived in an apartment that the author paid for entirely, and they had a history of being cheated on, so trust was a big part of their relationship. The girlfriend had always enjoyed traveling and had planned this trip for months, but she didn't tell him until five days before leaving. She wanted to go alone for self-discovery, and he didn't want her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her to leave, and she did, staying with her parents. Now he's questioning if he was the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the relationship dynamics here. The author was the one paying for the apartment, and the girlfriend was supposed to compensate for her share. Trust was a foundation, so maybe he felt betrayed by her not informing him about the trip. But on the other hand, she had planned it for months and wanted to do it on her own. The key points are communication and mutual respect. \n\nEven if she had a right to do her own things, especially since they had a history of trust issues, not being honest about such a significant plan might have been a problem. The author might feel that if they had trust, she should have communicated her plans earlier. However, kicking her out because she wanted to travel alone seems harsh. The author gave her an ultimatum, and she left. The house being his might mean she didn't have a legal right to stay, but emotionally, the situation is about the relationship breaking down due to lack of communication. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he handled it by evicting her, which might have been a mistake. Ending a relationship is a big step, and the manner in which he did it\u2014immediately threatening her with leaving the home\u2014could be seen as extreme. Instead of a calm discussion, he used force, which can hurt even more. The girlfriend's actions might have been the final straw, but the author's response could be seen as controlling or not allowing her autonomy, even if he was the one paying the rent. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because the way he handled the disagreement was confrontational and led to immediate separation, which might not be the best approach. But I'm not sure. If the trust was truly a cornerstone and she hadn't communicated important plans, then maybe he had a right to feel hurt. But using the threat of eviction as a means to end the relationship when she didn't want to share the trip details immediately seems like an overreaction. The fact that she was going to be away and he was upset, but then reacting by making her leave his home might not be the right way. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from both sides. The author might not be in the wrong, but the way he ended it could be seen as too harsh. However, in terms of responsibility for the breakup, maybe he's not in the wrong because he had his reasons. But the question is about being in the wrong for the action (kicking her out). So, if he had the authority to do that since he was the sole rent-payer, but emotionally it's a tough situation. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards A because the author's response was immediate and not allowing for discussion, which might not be the right approach. Ending a relationship is a personal choice, but doing it in the context of evicting her from the home can be seen as controlling, especially if they were in a home he paid for. But maybe in this case, since he had the financial responsibility, he felt justified? It's tricky. The girlfriend's secret planning could be the issue, but the author's reaction... I'm still thinking A is the better answer because the action was abrupt and possibly punitive.\n"
