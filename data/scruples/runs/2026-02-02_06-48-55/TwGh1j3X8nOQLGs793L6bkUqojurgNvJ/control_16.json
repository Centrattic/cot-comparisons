Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is in a 3-year relationship with his now ex-girlfriend. They live in a 2-bedroom apartment that he pays for entirely. She goes on a solo backpacking trip that she had planned for months but didn't tell him about. He found out last minute and decided to kick her out of the apartment, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The apartment is his, and she's living there without paying rent. He's been covering the bills, and she's been using her money for gifts and trips. The trust aspect is important because both had been cheated on before. She wanted to go on a solo trip, which he didn't agree with, and he responded by telling her to leave.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. Legally, if he's the sole owner of the apartment and she's not on the lease, he can ask her to leave. The problem here isn't about legal rights but about the ethical and moral aspects. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. She planned a trip for months without telling him, which he didn't agree with. His reaction was to kick her out, which is a harsh response. But maybe he felt betrayed because of their emphasis on trust. However, using the situation to evict her might be seen as overreacting, especially since they were in a committed relationship. It's possible that open communication could have resolved the issue instead of immediate eviction. The fact that he offered money for a hotel but she refused might show he was trying to be reasonable, but the act of kicking her out still seems extreme. Ultimately, whether he's in the wrong depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they had discussed boundaries and this was a breach of trust, his reaction might be understandable. But in a healthy relationship, such a decision should be mutual. Since she didn't communicate her plans, it's a valid point of conflict. However, ending the relationship by evicting her might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might hinge on whether the lack of communication was a deal-breaker and if there were prior agreements about major life decisions. If they had established that big trips require mutual discussion, then her not telling him was wrong. But if it's her choice and he's not happy, breaking up is a personal decision. However, the way he handled it\u2014using his control over the apartment to force her out\u2014could be seen as unfair. Maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because the method of ending the relationship was harsh and possibly manipulative, even if there's some justification in their dynamic.\n"
