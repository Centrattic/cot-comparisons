Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author breaking up with his girlfriend after she announced a solo backpacking trip she had planned for months, which he found out about only days before she was to leave. He kicked her out of his apartment, which he pays for.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years. The apartment is paid by the author, and they share the utility costs. They place a lot of trust in each other, given both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip, which the author didn't agree with, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since he pays for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to demand to stay, even though she contributes to the bills. He offered a week's hotel money, which she refused. She left, and he's now called out for being controlling.\n\nNow, considering the context of their relationship. They have a history of trust issues, and communication seems important. The girlfriend planned the trip for months but told him only days before, which the author found out last minute. The author felt that the lack of communication and going against his wishes was a breach of trust. When she said she wanted to go alone to \"discover herself,\" the author responded by kicking her out, using the fact that he pays for the apartment as justification.\n\nBut is that a valid reason? The girlfriend was contributing to the bills, even if indirectly. The apartment was a shared space, and the author's decision to kick her out might be seen as using financial power to control her decisions. Even if he pays the rent, it's a shared living arrangement, and her leaving was part of her decision. The author's response of turning it into a breakup might be seen as extreme. Instead of discussing and finding a compromise, he gave a ultimatum that led to their separation.\n\nAlso, the fact that their relationship was based on trust means that communication was key. The girlfriend's decision to not inform him earlier could be a breach of trust on her part, but the author's reaction might be equally damaging. By evicting her, he's using his financial leverage to enforce his will, which could be seen as controlling, even if he's not physically abusive.\n\nThe people calling him a controlling asshole might be right because he's using the apartment as a leverage. People in relationships where one partner pays more for the living expenses might find it unfair if that financial power is used to control the other's decisions. The author's approach was to terminate the relationship rather than discuss and find a solution, which could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans early enough, leading to a last-minute conflict. If they had discussed it earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But the author's response was to kick her out, which is a harsh measure. The fact that he offered hotel money but she refused might not matter if the core issue was about trust and communication.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the girlfriend's lack of communication is a fault, the author's reaction of evicting her and breaking up might be excessive. Using the apartment as a bargaining chip in the relationship is problematic, especially in a situation where trust is a cornerstone. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he took an extreme action rather than addressing the issue through dialogue. The key here is the ultimatum and the use of financial power to enforce his decision, which can be seen as controlling behavior. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
