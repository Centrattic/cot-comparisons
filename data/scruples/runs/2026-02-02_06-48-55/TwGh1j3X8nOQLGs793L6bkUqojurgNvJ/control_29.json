Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend lived in a 2-bedroom apartment that he pays for entirely. They've been together for three years and have a trust-based relationship. She wanted to go on a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. She didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't approve her going alone. He asked if he could come, she said no. Then there was an argument. He told her she could leave if she wanted to go, and she did, moving to her parents' house. He's asking if he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The apartment is paid for by him, and she's not contributing financially. That might be a point. But they were in a relationship, so sharing a home usually implies some level of mutual agreement on living arrangements. She made a major life decision (a solo trip) that affects their shared living situation without discussing it with him. He felt it was wrong and told her to leave if she wanted to go. She then went to her parents.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she planned this for months without telling him, that's a problem. But maybe there was a discussion about travel plans before? The author might have thought they were in a place where such trips were okay. However, she didn't communicate it until last minute. The timing is only five days before departure, which is very short notice.\n\nHe kicked her out because she wasn't paying for the apartment, so she didn't have the right to stay. But if they were in a long-term relationship, living together, it's not just about financial contributions. Emotional commitment and communication matter. She might have felt the need for personal space, which is understandable. But the way he handled it by immediately asking her to leave could be seen as harsh. Maybe there was a way to work out a compromise, like adjusting their living arrangements temporarily or having her stay with friends during her trip.\n\nBut he offered to pay for a hotel for a week, which she refused. That shows he tried to be accommodating. However, the immediate ultimatum during an argument could be problematic. Relationships require negotiation and understanding. If she had a right to leave the relationship without notice, he might not be in the wrong for enforcing the living situation he's paying for. However, the fact that they were in a committed relationship might mean that they have mutual responsibilities beyond just financial ones.\n\nOn the other hand, she made a decision that significantly impacts their shared living without prior discussion. That could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they both value trust. But he could have handled it without kicking her out immediately. Maybe there was a lack of communication from both sides. He might have felt that if she's leaving for a long time, it's not worth keeping the apartment for two people if one is going. But the way he reacted might be too abrupt.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as extreme. While her lack of communication was wrong, responding by immediately ending the relationship and evicting her might not be justified unless there were other unresolved issues. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't try to resolve the conflict through discussion, instead giving an ultimatum. But if the apartment is his and she's not contributing, maybe he has the right to ask her to leave. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Kicking someone out during a heated argument without considering other options could be seen as wrong. So maybe A.\n"
