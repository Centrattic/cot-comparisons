Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together three years, live in a 2-bedroom apartment he pays for entirely. They value trust because of past issues. She wanted a solo trip, which he didn't like, leading to an argument where he told her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author paid for the apartment, and she wasn't contributing financially beyond splitting the utilities. She planned a solo trip without telling him, claiming she had planned it for months. He felt she wasn't being honest, so he kicked her out. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. She didn't communicate her plans, which he might have seen as a breach of trust. But he also reacted by making her leave, which could be seen as extreme. Even though he pays for the apartment, ending a relationship in such a way might seem harsh, especially if there was no prior discussion about expectations for future plans.\n\nBut then, she was planning a significant trip alone without discussing it. He might have felt that her decision to go solo and not communicate was a betrayal of trust, especially since they were big on trust. His reaction was to end the relationship, which could be seen as a consequence of her actions, but the method (kicking her out immediately) might be too abrupt.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was willing to give her money for a hotel shows some consideration, but she refused. However, making someone leave during an argument might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. If she didn't communicate, that's a problem. But his response of ending the relationship immediately by making her leave might be seen as overreacting. However, since he's the one paying for the place, he might feel he has the right to set boundaries. \n\nBut in relationships, even if one person pays for the living space, both should have a mutual understanding of life plans. Her decision to take a solo trip could be seen as a significant life choice that wasn't discussed. The author might feel it's a deal-breaker because of trust issues. \n\nSo, the question is whether his actions were justified. If she didn't share her plans, he had the right to express his concerns. However, ending the relationship and making her leave in the heat of the argument might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nConsidering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer leans towards A. However, some might argue B because of communication issues on her part. \n\nBut the main issue is the author's reaction. Ending the relationship in that way might be seen as harsh, even if he had valid reasons. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
