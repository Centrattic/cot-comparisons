Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after the girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip without announcing it earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple lived in an apartment where the guy paid for everything, and the girl was planning a solo trip. The guy didn't know about it until four days before she left. He asked to join, she said no. Then he told her to leave the house, kicked her out, and she went to her parents. People called him a controlling asshole.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key points here are communication and trust. The couple had a history of being open and trusting each other. The girl had planned the trip for months but kept it a secret because she thought he wouldn't support her. The guy was upset because she didn't communicate early enough. He felt like he was paying for the apartment, and she didn't contribute financially. When she announced the trip, he reacted strongly by ending the relationship and evicting her.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The guy paid for the apartment, which the girl didn't pay for. That might create an imbalance. If she was using his home as a base while planning these trips, maybe she didn't consider his feelings about financial contributions and shared responsibilities. However, the trip was planned for months, so why didn't she tell him earlier? She knew he wouldn't support it, but hiding it might have been a breach of trust, which they both valued.\n\nWhen she finally told him, he reacted by ending the relationship. His reasoning was that since he paid for the apartment, she didn't need to stay. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. But kicking someone out of a shared home isn't just about who pays. Even if he pays the rent, it's a shared living space, and evicting someone without a legal process is problematic. In many places, you can't just kick someone out unless you have a legal process. So that's a red flag. He might have violated housing laws by evicting her without proper notice or legal procedure.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: she went on a solo trip because she wanted to discover herself, and he felt it was a dealbreaker. Maybe they had different priorities. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately and ending the relationship after an argument\u2014could be seen as harsh. Did he have a right to end the relationship over a disagreement about travel plans? Maybe, but the method was questionable.\n\nTrust was a big part of their relationship. She didn't tell him about the trip until last minute because she thought he wouldn't support it. That's a problem because trust involves honesty. However, he might not have been supportive, so her decision to keep it a secret was to avoid conflict. Both sides have their issues here.\n\nThe key issue is the eviction. If they lived together, even if he paid the rent, she has the right to be in the home unless there's a legal eviction process. Kicking her out without that could be illegal. So from a legal standpoint, he's in the wrong. Emotionally, maybe not, but legally, yes. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. But often people consider legal aspects in these judgments.\n\nAlso, the fact that people called him a controlling asshole suggests that society might see his actions as over the line. Controlling behavior would include trying to keep her from traveling, but she was the one who went against his wishes. However, the way he reacted\u2014immediately ending the relationship and evicting her\u2014could be seen as controlling or extreme.\n\nIn summary, the guy might not be entirely wrong in wanting to end the relationship because of the lack of communication and trust, but the method he used (evicting her) was inappropriate. So, he's partially in the wrong. The answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the eviction, but there's nuance. But according to the question's options, it's either A or B. Since the key issue is the eviction, which is a clear wrong, the answer is A.\n"
