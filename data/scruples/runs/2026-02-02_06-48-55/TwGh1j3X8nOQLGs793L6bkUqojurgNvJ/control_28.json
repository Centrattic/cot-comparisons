Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and when he found out, he kicked her out of their shared apartment. The apartment is paid for by him, and they both value trust a lot. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They've been together for three years, and the apartment is his responsibility financially. She didn't contribute directly to the rent but compensated him for utilities. That might be a point. If she's moving out, maybe he's justified in not wanting her to stay if she's leaving suddenly. But wait, she was going on this trip alone, which he didn't agree with. He asked to come along, but she said it was for self-discovery, and that he wouldn't approve. Then, he said she could leave the house without him, which led to her moving to her parents'.\n\nSo, the author is upset because she didn't communicate the trip earlier. She had planned it for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. That's a big issue because they value trust. If she wasn't honest about a major decision like that, maybe he's justified in being upset. But then, when he kicks her out, is that going too far? If the apartment is his and she's not paying rent, he can't be forced to let her stay, right? But the way he did it\u2014during an argument\u2014might come off as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, she was going on a solo trip, which he might see as negligent, especially if they were supposed to be a team. However, in a relationship, both partners should have some independence. Maybe she felt the need to do this trip, and he overreacted. The fact that he offered money for a hotel but she refused might be a point in his favor, but the immediate kickout seems extreme. \n\nThe people calling him a controlling asshole might be right because he took away her housing so abruptly. Even if the apartment is his, ending a relationship by making her leave immediately could be seen as cruel, especially if she wasn't expecting it. Also, if they were in a committed relationship, both should have some mutual respect for each other's space. But if she broke trust by not discussing the trip earlier, maybe he's in a position to end things. \n\nHmm, it's tricky. The main issues are lack of communication from her and his reaction. Since he's the one who ended it, and if the problem was her not being truthful about the trip, then maybe he's right to break up. But the method of kicking her out immediately might be where he's wrong. It's a combination of both. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer depends on the communication issue, maybe she's at fault. But if the focus is on his reaction, maybe he is. \n\nIn similar situations, sudden removal from a shared home without prior notice is often seen as harsh. Even if the apartment is his, ending a relationship like that can be seen as extreme. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because of how he handled it, even if her actions were problematic.\n"
