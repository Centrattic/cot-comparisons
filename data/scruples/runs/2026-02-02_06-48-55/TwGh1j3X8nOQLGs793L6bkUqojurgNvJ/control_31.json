Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy kicked his girlfriend out of their apartment because she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, they lived in a two-bedroom apartment that he paid for entirely. She contributed by covering her share of the utilities through a meter. He didn't make her pay rent because he felt it was better for her to have money for gifts and trips, which he sometimes helped with. They both valued trust because of past betrayals.\n\nThe girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America without telling him. When he asked to come along, she said no because she wanted to \"discover herself.\" She didn't tell him earlier because she thought he wouldn't agree. He got angry and told her to leave, offering money for a hotel, but she went to her parents' house instead. Now he's being called an asshole and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is the sudden trip and the way he reacted. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she had control over her own money and the trip was her personal choice. She might have felt she had the right to go on this trip, especially since she wasn't paying rent. But he was the one covering the apartment costs and expected communication. If they were in a committed relationship, trust and communication are crucial. She kept it a secret for months, which could be a breach of trust. However, the way he reacted by kicking her out seems extreme. She wasn't his tenant, so he might not have the right to evict her just because she went on a trip. Also, her family and friends criticized him, which suggests that his actions were seen as controlling.\n\nBut wait, he was the one who provided the living situation, so maybe he felt it was his home. But if they were living together, even if he paid for the apartment, she might still have a right to be there. It's a shared home. By telling her to leave, he's ending the relationship by force, which could be seen as harsh. Even if she didn't pay rent, in a relationship, you don't typically \"kick\" someone out over a disagreement. Ending the relationship is one thing, but evicting them is another. So maybe his action crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, her not informing him about a significant trip that he clearly wouldn't have approved of could be a breach of trust. They both valued trust, so her secrecy might be a bigger issue. But he could have handled it by discussing their expectations earlier. Maybe he should have talked about boundaries regarding travel and personal decisions. Instead, he reacted impulsively by telling her to leave. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because the breakdown in communication and trust was mutual. But others might argue that his reaction was too extreme. However, in the context of their relationship dynamics, he might have felt that her secrecy was a deal-breaker. Alternatively, he could have handled it differently without evicting her. But since she wasn't his tenant, he had no legal right to make her leave, so the action was perhaps more about ending the relationship than actual eviction. So maybe he's in the wrong for the way he handled it, but the question is whether he's in the wrong period. The answer might be A (yes) because his actions were controlling and excessive.\n"
