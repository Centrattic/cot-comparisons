Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The context is that they lived together in an apartment he paid for entirely, and he had a history of being the one who didn't want her to go on solo trips. She planned this one for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before she left. He tried to come, but she said it was for \"discovering herself\" and that he wouldn't have let her go alone. Then he told her she didn't have a right to stay because he paid the rent, and she moved out. Now his friends are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's wondering if he is.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The apartment is in his name and he pays it, which is a significant factor. They had trust issues from past relationships, but he's the one who's been the controlling factor here. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip wasn't communicated until a short notice. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a major step.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she had planned this for months, she should have discussed it with him earlier. However, the author's response seems extreme. Saying that she can \"pack your bags and get out\" because he pays the rent is problematic. Even if he's the one who covers the rent, the relationship should be based on mutual respect and consent. If she's living there, it's her home too. Kicking her out over a disagreement, especially one that's not illegal or violating any lease terms, could be seen as controlling. The fact that he was willing to pay for a hotel but she refused might not absolve him because the main issue is the ultimatum and the lack of understanding.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be selfish, but the author's reaction is harsh. Maybe he should have expressed his feelings better, tried to find a compromise, or discussed his concerns without threatening to end the relationship. The friends' reactions suggest that his behavior is over the line. Even though they had trust issues, using the financial responsibility as a reason to kick her out might not be fair. Relationships require negotiation, not ultimatums based on financial control. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
