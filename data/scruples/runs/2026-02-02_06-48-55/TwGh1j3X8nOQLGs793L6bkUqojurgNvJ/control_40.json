Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the guy pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend went on a solo trip without telling him, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The apartment is paid for by the author, and the girlfriend was supposed to contribute. She planned a solo backpacking trip, didn't tell him, and when he found out, he kicked her out. The main issue here is the lack of communication and the sudden decision to leave.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to stay. But wait, they were in a 3-year relationship. Even if he pays for the apartment, a long-term partner might expect some level of mutual agreement on major life decisions, like a three-week trip. She might have thought she could go, but not informing him could be a breach of trust, especially since they emphasized trust in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it by kicking her out and offering a hotel might be seen as harsh. Maybe he should have discussed it more and tried to find a compromise instead of immediately ending things. The fact that she was going on a solo trip might be a deal-breaker for him, but was ending the relationship the right approach?\n\nAlso, he's getting calls from others labeling him a controlling asshole. That suggests others might not see his action as justified. But if the relationship was built on trust and mutual respect, not telling each other about a major trip could be a problem. The girlfriend might have crossed a line by not communicating, but the author's response could be seen as too extreme.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate a significant decision. On the other, the author's reaction of evicting her might be too harsh, especially since they were in a 3-year relationship. The fact that he was willing to give her money but she left immediately might show he's trying, but the method might be wrong.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. If they had prior agreements about travel, maybe it's different. But given the context, the author's actions could be seen as overreacting. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his method was questionable. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's action broke trust, then maybe he's justified. But the sudden breakup might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIn the end, it's a tricky call. The answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because ending the relationship and evicting someone, even if you pay for the apartment, can be seen as harsh. Or maybe not (B) because the girlfriend didn't communicate, which is a breach of their trust-based relationship. I'm a bit torn, but given that relationships require communication and mutual respect, the author's reaction might be seen as too extreme. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
