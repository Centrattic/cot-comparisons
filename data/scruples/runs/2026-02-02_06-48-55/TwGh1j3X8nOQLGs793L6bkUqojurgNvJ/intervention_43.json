Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend, who he's been with for three years, live together in an apartment that he pays for entirely. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she didn't tell him about until she announced it a few days before she was leaving. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and he didn't want her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her to leave, and she did, staying with her parents. Now he's wondering if he was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The apartment is paid for by the author, which he mentions is a choice he made because he can afford it and not to burden her. They split the utility costs. So he's contributing more financially to their shared home. The girlfriend, on the other hand, plans a solo trip, which he didn't support, and when she didn't tell him, he kicked her out. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and consent. The author says she had been planning the trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving. If they are a couple who values trust and communication, not informing each other about major life decisions could be a problem. But the girlfriend's reasoning was that he wouldn't have agreed, so she didn't tell him. That might seem like an overreach, because even if she thought he wouldn't support it, she should have discussed it with him instead of just going.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to kick her out of the apartment he owns. Even though he pays for it, they are in a relationship, and evicting a partner without legal grounds could be problematic. The apartment is a shared space, even if he pays for it. If they were in a legal lease agreement where she was a tenant, he might need to follow eviction procedures. But since they're a couple, it's more complicated. Also, he offered her money for a hotel, which she refused, but that doesn't change the fact that he's asking her to leave the home they share.\n\nAnother aspect is the suddenness of the decision. Arguing and then immediately evicting someone is a drastic step. Even if there was a disagreement, giving her time to move out would be more reasonable. Also, the emotional aspect: his phone was filled with people calling him an asshole, which suggests that his action might not be socially acceptable.\n\nBut maybe the author felt that her breaking trust by not communicating such a big decision justified his actions. However, the way he handled it\u2014during an argument, immediately telling her to leave\u2014could be seen as a controlling or extreme reaction. He could have handled the situation by discussing boundaries, maybe setting conditions for future decisions, but kicking her out of their home seems harsh.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which is important in a relationship. The author reacted in a way that ended their relationship abruptly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one who took the action of ending the relationship and evicting her, and given that the apartment is a shared space in a relationship, his action might be seen as more egregious, especially if there was no prior discussion about such scenarios. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's action of immediately kicking her out during an argument without a legal basis or prior agreement seems like overstepping, making him at least partially at fault. But I'm not sure if it's entirely his fault. The girlfriend's lack of communication is also a significant factor. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was his, and it's a sudden and harsh response, I think the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
