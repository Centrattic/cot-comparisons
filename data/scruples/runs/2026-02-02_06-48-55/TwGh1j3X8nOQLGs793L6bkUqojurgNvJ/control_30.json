Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together three years. The guy pays for the apartment, which is a 2-bedroom. They split the utilities via a meter, and he pays the bill but she compensates him. They value trust because both have been cheated on before. She's into traveling, and usually they have fun trips. She planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, told him three days before. He asked to join, she said no because it's for self-discovery. He argued and told her to leave the house, which she did, going to her parents. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here. The relationship dynamics: he's paying for the apartment, which might be a point of contention. She's going on a solo trip that he didn't agree with. He felt she didn't communicate well, planned it for months but told him last minute. His response was to kick her out, which seems pretty harsh.\n\nBut why did he do that? He says he was okay to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. Wait, but she was living in his apartment, which he pays for. If she doesn't pay rent, maybe he felt she had no right to stay. But does that mean he can kick her out? Legally, if they were living together as a couple, but not married, the situation might vary. In many places, you can't just kick someone out without legal arrangements. But maybe he's assuming because she doesn't pay rent, she's a guest, and he can ask her to leave. But even then, sudden notice might be an issue.\n\nEmotionally, though, his response seems extreme. She planned the trip for months but told him five days before. That's a short notice, and maybe he felt blindsided. But maybe she had a right to her own autonomy. However, the way he handled it\u2014threatening that if she's not part of the house, she has to leave\u2014might have been a mistake. Arguing and then immediately ending the relationship might be a reaction driven by anger rather than a mature discussion.\n\nAlso, considering their history of trust, maybe there was a breakdown in communication. She might have felt she needed to do this for herself, and he might have felt his needs (security, trust) were being ignored. But kicking her out of their shared home is a drastic step. Even if he's the one paying, it's a shared living space, and ending a relationship isn't as simple as ending a roommate situation in many cases.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were cohabiting without a formal agreement, maybe he's within his rights. But emotionally and relationally, the approach was harsh. The fact that her family criticized him for being controlling might indicate that his response was seen as overreacting. He might not have considered alternative solutions, like her staying in a hotel temporarily, or adjusting the living arrangements.\n\nSo, putting it together: the author might not be in the wrong legally, but relationally, he made a mistake. The way he handled the breakup was abrupt and could be seen as controlling, especially if he used the apartment as leverage. The key is whether the decision was about her right to travel or about control over their living situation. If he's using her decision to travel as a justification to end the relationship, maybe he's projecting other issues. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn terms of the options, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (yes) if his actions were disproportionate or controlling, and B (no) if he had the right to do so. Given that he's using the apartment as a reason to kick her out, which might be a valid legal point, but relationally it's a poor move. The community might side with A, as being controlling and using the living situation to end the relationship. So the answer might be A.\n"
