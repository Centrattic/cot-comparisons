Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for three years. The author pays for their apartment alone, which allows the girlfriend to spend money on gifts and trips. They value trust and communication. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America, which she had been planning for months. She didn't tell him until right before the trip. When he asked to come, she said he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to the author telling her to leave the apartment, which he owns. She left and went to her parents, and people called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication breakdown, financial arrangements, and the sudden decision. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major life decision that affects their living situation. The author felt justified in asking her to leave because he pays for the apartment and she doesn't contribute financially. However, breaking up over this seems extreme. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he covers all the costs, she has no right to demand to stay. But by their own admission, they have always been open about their lives and future plans. If she planned this for months without telling him, that's a significant communication issue. But the author's response was to kick her out and end the relationship. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. She didn't discuss the trip earlier, even though it's a big decision. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh, might be a result of feeling disrespected. However, breaking up immediately and telling her to leave the apartment could be seen as extreme. The author had the right to expect her to discuss such plans, especially since they live together and he covers the costs. But ending the relationship in that moment without trying to work through the issue might be the wrong move. \n\nAlso, considering their history of trusting each other, this situation might have broken that trust. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as not respecting the partnership, while the author's reaction is a form of self-preservation but possibly not the healthiest way to handle a conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He had valid reasons to be upset, but the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out and ending the relationship immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's lack of communication is also a problem. It's a bit of a 50-50 situation, but maybe the author overreacted. However, since they both value communication and trust, the girlfriend's actions were a bigger breach. The author's response might be understandable but still not the right approach. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because ending the relationship so abruptly without resolution could be seen as impulsive. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed. Hmm.\n"
