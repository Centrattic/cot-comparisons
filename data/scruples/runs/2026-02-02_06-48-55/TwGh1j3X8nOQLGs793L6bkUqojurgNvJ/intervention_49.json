Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip without telling him. The key points here are the context of their living situation, trust, and communication.\n\nFirst, the apartment is paid for by the author, and they both live in it. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip that she had been working on for months, which the author found out about only days before she left. She didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't approve. The author then told her to leave the apartment, which she did, and she went to her parents' house. He's defending his decision by saying she didn't pay for the apartment and that he offered her money for a hotel.\n\nNow, considering trust and communication. They mentioned they were big on trust, which is important given their past. If she planned this trip for months, not telling him seems like a breach of trust. The author might feel that her decision to go without discussing it was a deal-breaker. But on the other hand, maybe she had the right to her own independence and privacy. The author's reaction of immediately kicking her out raises questions. Was that a proportionate response? Ending the relationship because of a decision that's been in the works for months might be too harsh, especially if there was a misunderstanding. Also, the author's control over the living situation could be a factor. If she wasn't paying for the apartment, does he have the right to ask her to leave? It's complicated. Maybe they should have discussed it more. The author's reaction might be seen as impulsive and controlling, especially if he didn't give her a chance to explain or if the breakup was immediate without considering her perspective. However, if he felt that her decision was a violation of their trust and he couldn't reconcile that, maybe his actions were his way of setting a boundary. It's a tough call, but the sudden breakup without prior discussion might make the author look like he overreacted. So, while her not informing him was a problem, his immediate response could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
