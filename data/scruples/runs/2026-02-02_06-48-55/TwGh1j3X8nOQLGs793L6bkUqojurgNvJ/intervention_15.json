Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip he didn't agree with. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment, and they have a financial arrangement where the girlfriend covers her share. They value trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about because she thought he wouldn't approve. The argument happened when he found out, and he told her to leave his house, which she did, going to her parents' place. He then broke up with her, and she got a lot of calls from people saying he was a controlling asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and boundaries. The girlfriend kept the trip a secret for months, which is a big deal, especially since they emphasized trust. The author felt betrayed and used the situation as a reason to end the relationship. The key points to consider are: Was the girlfriend's secrecy justified? Did the author overreact by kicking her out? \n\nThe author's reasoning was that since she didn't pay for the apartment and he offered to pay for a hotel, she had no right to stay. However, breaking up over a disagreement, especially by evicting someone from a home, can be seen as extreme. The fact that the girlfriend was planning a solo trip might be a red flag for the author, but the way he handled it\u2014using the financial aspect as leverage\u2014could be seen as controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's secrecy is problematic. If they had open communication about future plans, she should have discussed this trip earlier. The author might feel that his trust was broken, which is important in their relationship. But the immediate reaction of breaking up and evicting her might be too harsh, especially if there was no prior discussion about boundaries for such trips.\n\nAlso, external opinions called him controlling, which suggests others see his actions as over the line. Even if he had valid reasons, the method of ending things by removing her from the home he pays for could be seen as using financial power in the relationship. \n\nIn relationships where trust is a cornerstone, both parties should communicate openly. The author might have felt that the secrecy was a violation of trust, but the way he reacted could be seen as inconsiderate. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing the trip and finding a compromise, would have been better. Instead, he made a drastic decision that led to her leaving, which might be the wrong approach even if his feelings were hurt.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with more empathy and communication. Breaking up over a disagreement, especially using the financial arrangement as leverage, can come off as controlling. The girlfriend's secrecy is problematic, but the author's response was too harsh. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
