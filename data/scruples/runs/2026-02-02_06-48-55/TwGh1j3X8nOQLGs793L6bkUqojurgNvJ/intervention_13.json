Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment alone because he wanted to, and the girlfriend compensates him through a meter. They both prioritize trust because of past cheating experiences. The girlfriend planned a solo trip she hadn't told him about, saying he wouldn't approve. They had an argument, and the guy told her she could leave, which she did, going to her parents' house. He's now being called controlling.\n\nSo, the main points are: the girl planned the trip secretly, he found out, they argued, and he kicked her out. The guy's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she had no right to demand to stay. But maybe the issue is about communication and trust. Since they value trust, maybe not discussing such a big trip is a problem. However, the guy's response was to kick her out immediately, which seems harsh. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should communicate major decisions, especially if it involves being away for a long time. The girl didn't tell him, which could be a breach of trust. But the guy's reaction was to end the relationship by kicking her out of the apartment. Even though he pays for it, that's a drastic step. Maybe he should have addressed the lack of communication first, not ended the relationship. Also, the fact that he was willing to help with money but she left anyway might show he was trying to be supportive. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girl had been planning it for months without telling him, which is a big deal. The guy might feel betrayed, especially since trust was a big part of their relationship. However, ending the relationship by throwing her out might be too extreme. Maybe he should have discussed the reasons behind her not telling him, given her a chance to explain, and worked through it. \n\nSo, maybe the guy is in the wrong because his response was disproportionate. The girl's secrecy was wrong, but the immediate breakup without discussion could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he handled it, using the apartment situation to kick her out, might be seen as controlling, especially if she didn't have a place to stay. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The girl's secrecy is a problem, but the guy's reaction is also extreme. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with more empathy and instead used the apartment as leverage to end the relationship immediately. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: if trust was important, and she broke that trust by not being open, then maybe he's justified. However, the immediate action of kicking her out might not be the right approach. So maybe A.\n"
