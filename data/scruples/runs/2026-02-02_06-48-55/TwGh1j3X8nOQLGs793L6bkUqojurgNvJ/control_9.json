Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for three years, live in a 2-bedroom apartment he pays for, with her contributing via a meter. Trust is important for both because of past cheating issues. She planned a solo trip across South America, months in advance, but didn't tell him until five days before. He wanted to come, she said no because she wanted to \"discover herself.\" He felt she wasn't honest and kicked her out, leading to backlash.\n\nNow, considering their living arrangement: He pays the rent, she covers her share. She's been planning this trip for months but didn't inform him. His reaction was to tell her she could leave, which she did. The key points here are communication and trust.\n\nIn a relationship built on trust, being honest about significant plans is crucial. She didn't communicate her intentions, which could have caused an argument, but did he have the right to kick her out? The apartment is his, so he can ask her to leave. However, the way he phrased it (\"pack your bags and get out\") might come off as harsh. She had the right to stay if she paid her share, but he's the one paying. But maybe the issue is more about the lack of communication and his reaction being too extreme. \n\nHis reasoning is that she didn't pay for the apartment, so she shouldn't demand to stay. However, they were in a committed relationship. Kicking someone out because of a disagreement, even if you own the place, can be seen as extreme. Also, his friends calling him an asshole suggests others might view his reaction as controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't respect his feelings by keeping her plans a secret. But breaking up over this might be a drastic measure. The author's actions are in question: was it about standing up for his boundaries or being overly controlling?\n\nIn summary, both have some accountability. She didn't communicate, he reacted strongly. However, the decision to end the relationship over a disagreement, especially with such a reaction, might be seen as the author being in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
