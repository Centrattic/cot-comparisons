Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share. They both value trust because of past relationships. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about because she thought he wouldn't approve. When he found out, he told her she could go without him, but if she left the apartment, that was it. She left, went to her parents, and people criticized him as controlling.\n\nSo, the main points are: the trip was unannounced, she planned it for months, he kicked her out when she left. The question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nI think the key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, even though they were planning to live together in an apartment he paid for. She had a history of planning trips, but this one was solo and last-minute? Wait, she said she had been planning it for months. So maybe she didn't tell him because he might have opposed it. But three days before the trip is a very short notice. If she had planned it for months, why didn't she talk to him earlier? That seems like a big red flag in the relationship. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out because she wasn't paying for the apartment. But the apartment is their shared home. If she left, maybe he's not at fault for setting boundaries. However, breaking up over an unannounced trip might be too harsh. The girlfriend might have felt her needs for personal freedom weren't being respected, especially if she felt she had to keep it secret. \n\nBut the author also didn't confront her earlier. If she had planned it for months, he might have missed signs. On the other hand, her not informing him about such a significant decision, especially affecting their living situation, is a problem. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the breakup seems extreme for an issue that could have been discussed and resolved. However, the girlfriend's lack of communication is also a problem. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe he's not wrong because he set a boundary that she didn't respect. But maybe he should have handled it differently instead of dumping her immediately. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if she was going to leave the apartment anyway, maybe he had the right to ask her to leave. But the fact that he kicked her out because she went on a trip without telling him... that seems harsh. Relationships require compromise, and maybe he overreacted. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: the apartment arrangement. He pays for it, but they live together. If she left, maybe he's not wrong to enforce the terms. But if she was supposed to be there and didn't inform him, maybe she was violating their trust. However, the surprise trip wasn't about cheating; it was about personal freedom. \n\nI think the author's main mistake was reacting with an ultimatum instead of trying to talk things out. Kicking her out because she wanted to go on a trip she had planned for months seems extreme, especially if the apartment is shared and he was okay with her being there. So, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nBut then, if she wasn't paying for the apartment and he was covering the costs, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not there. However, they were in a relationship, so mutual respect and communication are key. His reaction might have been out of proportion. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the situation could have been handled better through communication rather than an immediate breakup. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, but the author's response was too harsh. He should have addressed it earlier instead of using the apartment as leverage. So A.\n"
