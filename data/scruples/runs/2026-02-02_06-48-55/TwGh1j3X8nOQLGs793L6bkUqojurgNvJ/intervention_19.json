Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him. So, first, let's look at the context. They were in a 3-year relationship, living in an apartment he pays for. He handles the bills and she compensates him. They both value trust a lot because of past cheating experiences.\n\nThe main issue is the girlfriend's unannounced trip. She had been planning it for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before departure. He asked to go with her, but she said no because it was for self-discovery. She thought he wouldn't allow her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her to leave the apartment since she wasn't paying for it, and she went to her parents' house.\n\nNow, considering their communication style. They were supposed to be open and trust each other. If she had such a big trip planned for months, not discussing it with him seems like a breach of trust. But maybe she had her reasons, like fear of rejection. However, not communicating such a significant decision in a relationship is problematic.\n\nHe kicked her out because she didn't contribute to the apartment costs, but they were in a relationship. Maybe he felt disrespected or betrayed because she didn't share this plan. But is it fair to kick someone out of the home they live in just because they didn't communicate a personal decision? The apartment is his, but they were cohabiting. Even if she didn't pay rent, that doesn't necessarily mean she should be evicted over a disagreement.\n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014saying she could leave without him\u2014seems harsh. Instead of discussing and finding a compromise, he made an ultimatum. Maybe he could have expressed his feelings and tried to resolve the issue without ending the relationship. However, if he felt that the lack of communication was a deal-breaker, then ending the relationship might be his choice, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, she had a right to her own independence and should have communicated her plans. But the fact that she didn't tell him something so important could indicate a lack of respect for their relationship dynamics. He might have felt that this was a red flag, especially given their emphasis on trust.\n\nSo, who's at fault? Both might have some responsibility. She for not communicating, he for reacting with an ultimatum. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he ended the relationship because of her lack of communication, which was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he overreacted by immediately kicking her out instead of trying to resolve the issue, then he might be in the wrong. The key here is whether his reaction was proportionate. Ending a relationship is a big step, but if the issue was about trust and communication, and she violated that, then his decision might be justified. Alternatively, maybe he should have used the communication they usually had to address the problem without breaking up.\n\nI think the main problem is her not discussing the trip, which is a big deal in a relationship that relies on trust. His reaction might have been extreme, but given their history and the importance of trust, maybe he felt it was necessary. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he set boundaries based on their trust issues, and she crossed them. However, some might argue that his method of ending it was harsh. But given the context, maybe he had valid reasons.\n"
