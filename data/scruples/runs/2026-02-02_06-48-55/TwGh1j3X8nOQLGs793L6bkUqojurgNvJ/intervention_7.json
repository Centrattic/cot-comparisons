Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended the relationship with his girlfriend (now ex) because she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, they were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment entirely, and she compensates him for her share of the utilities. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before departure. When he asked to join, she said no because it's about self-discovery. He felt it was a betrayal of trust, leading to an argument where he told her to leave the house. She went to her parents and his phone was filled with people calling him an asshole.\n\nThe main issue here is communication and trust. They built their relationship on being open and honest. If she had planned a trip for months, not telling him until the last minute and refusing to include him could be seen as a breach of trust. He reacted by ending the relationship, which he justifies because she didn't pay for the apartment and he offered her money for a hotel. But was that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, she had the right to travel, but not communicating such a significant decision might be a red flag. The author felt it was a test of trust. On the other hand, ending the relationship by kicking her out might be seen as an overreaction. Instead of addressing the issue through discussion or setting boundaries beforehand, he resorted to ending things, which could be seen as impulsive. The fact that he was the one paying for the apartment might make people think he used that as a power move, which could be seen as controlling. However, if trust was a cornerstone, her secrecy could have genuinely broken that trust.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction was justified. If trust was a key component, then her actions undermined it. But ending the relationship in the heat of the argument without giving her a chance to explain or work it out might be too harsh. The key is whether the author handled it appropriately given their established values. If they had prior discussions about such trips, maybe it's different, but the story says they were into open communication. So not telling him about a months-long plan is a problem. However, the way he broke up with her\u2014by making her leave the apartment\u2014could be seen as using their living situation as leverage, which is problematic. It might have been better to have a conversation rather than an ultimatum. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for how he handled it, but his feelings are valid given the lack of communication. It's a tough call. The answer might hinge on whether the lack of communication was the main issue or the method of ending the relationship.\n"
