Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, and they split utilities. She planned a solo trip, which he found out about right before she was leaving. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" alone, which he felt was a problem. He told her she could leave, and she did, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication and mutual respect. Even though he pays for the apartment, their relationship should be based on trust and open communication, especially since they both have past issues with trust. The fact that she planned a months-long trip without telling him until last minute could be a big deal. But then again, he did kick her out of their home, which she might have been living in. \n\nHe says he offered her money for a hotel, but she refused. However, the apartment is his, so he might have the legal right to ask her to leave. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, such a decision could be seen as extreme. Maybe the issue is not just about the trip but about how he handled the breakup. \n\nShe might have felt she was being controlled because he didn't want her to go alone, but his response was to end the relationship immediately. That seems harsh. Even if he's upset, communicating better and discussing the issue instead of cutting her off might have been better. \n\nSo, considering all that, while she should have communicated better about the trip, his reaction of dumping her and making her leave the apartment could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require negotiation and understanding, not ultimatums based on one issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't handle it in a more constructive way.\n"
