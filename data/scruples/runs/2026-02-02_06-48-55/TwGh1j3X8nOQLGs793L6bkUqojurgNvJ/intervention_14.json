Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend (now ex) decided to go on a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. She didn't tell him until three days before the trip. The author didn't like the idea of her going alone, and when she said he wouldn't allow it, he told her to leave his apartment since he pays for it. She then went to her parents' house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment and uses a meter system where the girlfriend contributes to the bill. They emphasize trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to travel solo, which the author didn't support. The author's response was to kick her out, leading to her moving out.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend planned the trip for months but didn't tell him. That's a big deal because they value open communication. However, the author didn't handle it well by making her leave the apartment. Even though he pays for the apartment, the relationship is supposed to be about mutual respect and understanding. \n\nThe girlfriend's desire to travel is her personal freedom. The author's reaction seems extreme. Telling her to leave because she didn't pay for the apartment might not consider the emotional impact. Also, giving money for a hotel but she refused could be a point, but the act of asking her to leave immediately after an argument is harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the lack of communication was a breach of trust. But instead of discussing it calmly, he resorted to an ultimatum. In a relationship, handling such conflicts with communication is better than using financial power plays. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as controlling, especially since the girlfriend was within her rights to travel, even if he disagreed. The way he handled it\u2014using the apartment ownership as leverage\u2014could be seen as wrong because it's not a healthy way to resolve disagreements. Relationships require compromise, and his reaction seems like an overstep.\n"
