Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple ending their relationship because the girlfriend went on a solo trip without informing her boyfriend, who pays for their apartment. The author kicked her out, leading to friends calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years, living in an apartment the boyfriend pays for. They value trust, both having been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and believed he wouldn't have allowed it. The boyfriend confronted her, and she ended up moving out. The author says he kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment and offered her money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a significant trip she had planned for months. Even if they have a history of being open, this seems like a breach of trust. However, the boyfriend's response was to kick her out, which is a harsh action. \n\nThe apartment situation is important here. Since he pays for it, maybe he felt entitled to control who lives there. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, such decisions typically involve mutual agreement. If she was moving out, maybe the eviction was expected. But the way he said it\u2014\"you can leave without me\"\u2014could come off as manipulative or controlling, especially if it was a direct response to the argument.\n\nAlso, friends calling him an asshole suggests that his actions were seen as extreme. The girlfriend might have felt that the trip was her personal choice, and the boyfriend overreacted. However, if the couple had agreed on a living arrangement where he pays for the apartment in exchange for her contributions (like sharing expenses), her leaving might be a mutual decision. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend might have felt disrespected because she didn't communicate something so important. But reacting by evicting her could have been a power move rather than a constructive solution. The right to live in the apartment is legal since he owns it, so he has a point there. However, emotionally, in a relationship, such decisions might require more negotiation. \n\nIs the author wrong for evicting her? It depends on the circumstances. Legally, he's in the right as the apartment is his. Emotionally and relationally, it's more complex. The girlfriend's lack of communication was a problem, but the boyfriend's response was perhaps too abrupt. AITA situations often hinge on perceived fairness and communication. If the girlfriend had a history of being open, not telling him about a major trip could be a deal-breaker. But the way he ended it might have escalated things unnecessarily. \n\nIn the end, if the girlfriend chose to leave, maybe it wasn't the author's fault. But if he initiated the breakup by evicting her, that could be seen as wrong if it was a manipulative tactic. The fact that he offered money for a hotel but she refused might indicate she was already planning to leave. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he's standing up for his own boundaries, but others might see it as controlling. But given the girlfriend's lack of communication, maybe he's justified. However, the way he did it could be problematic. The friends' reactions suggest societal judgment is on her side, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because evicting someone over a disagreement, even if they live in his apartment, can be seen as harsh. The trip was planned for months, so maybe she had a right to her independence. The author's response was extreme. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The key factors are communication, trust, and the living arrangement. The girlfriend's actions breached trust, but the author's reaction was punitive. In terms of AITA, people often side with the person who is being more considerate and communicative. Since the girlfriend didn't communicate, the author might be justified, but his method of response could be wrong. However, given that the apartment is his, and he's allowing her to stay, maybe it's a matter of him reasserting his ownership. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own home and the trust issues. But I'm not 100% sure. The community might see it as controlling, but legally and in terms of their agreement, he's within his rights. So the answer is B.\n"
