Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America without telling her boyfriend, who pays for their apartment. The boyfriend then kicked her out after an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had been in a 3-year relationship, and they emphasized trust because both had been cheated on before. The apartment is paid for by the author, and the girlfriend was supposed to cover her part through a meter. The girlfriend's trip was a surprise, and she claimed she had planned it for months but didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't allow it. The author responded by saying she could leave, which she did, and people are calling him controlling.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. The girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be a significant life choice that the author didn't agree with, but the fact that she planned it for months without communication is a problem. The author might feel betrayed or that his trust was violated. However, the author's response was to kick her out immediately, which could be seen as extreme.\n\nThe apartment is his, so technically, he can ask her to leave. But relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If she didn't communicate her plans, that's a fault, but the author's reaction of immediate eviction might be harsh. The girlfriend might have a right to autonomy in her decisions, even if they conflict with the relationship. The fact that people called him an asshole suggests that his actions are seen as controlling. However, the author's perspective is that he was standing his ground.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of communication in relationships. The girlfriend's unannounced trip could be a breach of trust, but the author's response could also be a breach of trust. The apartment situation might play a role here\u2014since he pays for it, he might feel more entitled to control the living situation. However, relationships require negotiation and understanding. If they had discussed future plans and trust was a cornerstone, then the girlfriend's decision to go solo might be a deal-breaker. The author might have felt that if she didn't value their communication, the relationship was over.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have handled it differently, like discussing the issue and finding a compromise instead of immediately ending the relationship. The girlfriend might have been acting on her own desires, which the author found unacceptable. But ending a relationship over a disagreement about a trip, even if it's a big one, might be too extreme. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the breach of trust or an overreaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if his response was disproportionate. The girlfriend's actions were problematic, but the author's immediate eviction could be seen as controlling or not giving her the chance to resolve the issue through discussion. On the other hand, if the author felt that the relationship's trust was broken and he was standing up for his boundaries, then it's a more nuanced case. But generally, kicking someone out of the house over a disagreement about a trip might be too harsh. So, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
