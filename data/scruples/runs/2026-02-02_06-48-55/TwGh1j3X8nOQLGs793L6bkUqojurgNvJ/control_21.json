Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, which is a big deal. They emphasize trust because both have been cheated on before. She wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, planned for months, but didn't tell him. When he found out, he told her she could leave the apartment since she didn't pay for it. \n\nNow, considering their living situation: He's the one covering the rent, utilities, etc. She's using his money indirectly through the meter system. If she leaves, she doesn't have to stay there. But is it fair to dump her over this? \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She planned this trip for months and didn't inform him, which might be a breach of trust. They had always been open about their lives, so maybe she breaking that rule is a problem. On the other hand, he responded by kicking her out, which seems harsh. \n\nBut wait, he offered her money for a hotel, which she refused. So maybe he's not being completely controlling. However, ending the relationship over this might be extreme. Even if she broke the trust, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to make her leave the apartment\u2014could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's being called a controlling asshole by others might indicate that his actions were too severe. She was planning a trip she was excited about, and while not discussing it is a problem, the punishment of ending the relationship immediately might be disproportionate. \n\nHe might have had the right to be upset about the lack of communication, but the way he reacted could be seen as wrong. Maybe they should have talked it out instead of her being evicted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his reaction was overly harsh and could be seen as using the apartment as leverage to force her out, rather than addressing the communication issue directly and respectfully.\n"
