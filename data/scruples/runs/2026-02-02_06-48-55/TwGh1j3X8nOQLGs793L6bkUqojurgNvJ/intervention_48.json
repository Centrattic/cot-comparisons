Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a guy) broke up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. They were in a 3-year relationship, and he paid for their apartment. She had planned this trip for months and didn't tell him, saying he wouldn't have allowed her. He responded by making her leave the apartment, and she went to her parents'.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship context. They emphasized trust because both had been cheated on before. He paid for the apartment, she helped with the bill. She wanted to travel, and he was okay with her trips. But this one was solo and unannounced. He felt it was a betrayal of trust, leading him to end the relationship.\n\nHe says he gave her the option to stay in the apartment, but since she didn't pay for it, he didn't feel she had a right to stay. He offered money for a hotel, but she refused. Then she left. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Some points to consider: \n\n1. Trust and communication: Since they were big on trust, her not telling him about a months-long plan might be a breach. However, breaking up over it could be harsh, especially if there was no prior discussion about travel plans.\n\n2. Financial aspect: He paid for the apartment. If she's not a legal tenant, he might have a right to ask her to leave. But relationship issues shouldn't be settled through eviction. That's more of a legal matter.\n\n3. Emotional response: His reaction seems extreme. Kicking someone out of a shared home over a disagreement might be seen as retaliatory, even if there's a valid reason. The method of ending the relationship by removing her from the house could be problematic, especially if it's more about control than actual safety or legal issues.\n\n4. Alternatives: Could he have talked it out instead of immediately evicting her? Maybe setting boundaries without breaking up. But she also should have communicated better. \n\n5. Perception: Others might see him as controlling because he's using the apartment as leverage. However, if he's the one who owns it, he might have a right to some extent. But mixing emotional issues with living arrangements is tricky.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she planned a trip for months without telling him, that's a problem. But his response might be seen as overreacting. Ending a 3-year relationship by making her leave the house is a big step. It could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction rather than a mature resolution. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not handling it more calmly. But she also had a responsibility to communicate better. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the way he ended it could be seen as controlling and not allowing for discussion. Alternatively, if the apartment situation was his to manage, maybe he's not. But in a healthy relationship, you don't use housing as a weapon. So leaning towards A.\n"
