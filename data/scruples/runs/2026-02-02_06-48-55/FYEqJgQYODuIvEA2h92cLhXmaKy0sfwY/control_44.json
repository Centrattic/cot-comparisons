A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago. The ex moved out and accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix it, and they start hanging out, leading to a date.\n\nThe author is upset and decides to distance themselves from the friend. The key points here are the timeline and the friend's actions. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. However, the author still has feelings for the ex, which adds emotional complexity. \n\nThe friend waited a year before contacting the ex to fix the bumper. That seems like a long time. Maybe there's a reason he waited, but it's unclear. The author mentions they've continued to hang out, game, and get drinks all year, so the friend wasn't avoiding them. The friend knows the author still has feelings but proceeds anyway. That's a red flag. \n\nWhen the friend finally tells the author about the date, the author's response is to step back from the friendship. Is this justified? The author isn't in a relationship with the ex anymore, so the ex is free to date whoever. But the friend is now dating someone the author still has feelings for. The author's emotional reaction is valid because they're still processing the breakup. \n\nThe friend might be in the wrong for pursuing the ex when the author is still emotionally invested. However, maybe the friend thought it was okay since a year had passed. But the author's feelings are real, and the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Since the friend knew about the feelings and still went ahead, the author's decision to distance is understandable. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
