I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, there was an incident where she damaged their friend's car. Then, a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset and decided to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nThe author's main issue is that their friend is dating their ex. They mention they still have feelings for the ex, even though a year has passed. The friend, on the other hand, informed the author about the date, which the author appreciated, but they're cutting off the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let's consider both sides. The author has every right to feel hurt and might want space. However, it's been a year since the breakup, so emotions might have cooled down. The friend might have moved on, and the author might be projecting their lingering feelings onto the situation. The friend did reach out to inform them, which is respectful. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend, which could be overreacting if they're still not over their ex. On the other hand, the friend knowingly dated someone who was still in the author's emotional space, which could be insensitive.\n\nI need to weigh the timing here. A year is a significant amount of time. If the author is still emotionally attached, maybe they're the ones holding onto something that's past. The friend's actions might not be wrong if they're both moving on. But the author's decision to cut off the friend because of this relationship might be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the friend's autonomy. However, if the author is still in love with their ex, it's understandable to feel hurt. But the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing. If the author hasn't moved on and the friend is now pursuing their ex, the author's reaction could be justified. Alternatively, if it's been a year and the author is still upset, they might need to take responsibility for their own feelings rather than punishing the friend.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to feel hurt and need space. However, the friend might have handled it differently by being more considerate of the author's feelings. But the main question is about the author's right to be upset. Since the answer options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not), considering all angles, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset; people have the right to process their emotions after a breakup, even if it's been a year. The friend might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings when dating the ex, but the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their emotional state.\n"
