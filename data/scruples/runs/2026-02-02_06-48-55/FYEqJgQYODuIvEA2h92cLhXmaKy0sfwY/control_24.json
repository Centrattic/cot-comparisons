I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend is dating their ex. They broke up a year ago, and during the breakup, the ex damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her to fix the bumper, and now they're dating. The author is upset and decided to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the facts. The author was in a relationship with this person, then they broke up. After the breakup, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. The friend didn't reach out until a year later, which seems like a long time. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting them off because they still have feelings for the ex. \n\nThe key points here are the author's emotional response and the actions taken. The author is upset because their friend is dating someone they still have feelings for. They've been friends with this person, and the friend knows about their lingering feelings. The author is choosing to distance themselves, which is a personal decision. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're not doing anything illegal or unethical. They're expressing their feelings and making a choice to step back. Friends can choose to distance themselves if they feel uncomfortable. The friend did inform them, which shows some respect. However, the author might be seen as overreacting if the friend was only trying to resolve the car damage and ended up getting closer to the ex. But given that the author still has feelings, it's understandable. \n\nThe friend might have a responsibility to consider the author's feelings, especially since he knew about them. However, the ex is a free agent and can date whoever she wants. The author isn't the one who is wronged in the dating aspect. The issue is more about the friend's actions and the author's reaction. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, no, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to feel upset and to set boundaries in their friendship. The friend might have misjudged the situation, but the author's choice to step back is a valid personal decision.\n"
