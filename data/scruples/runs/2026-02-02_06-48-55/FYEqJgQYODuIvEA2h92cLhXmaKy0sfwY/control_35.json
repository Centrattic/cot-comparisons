I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. Let me break down the situation. \n\nThe author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend was there when the ex left, and she damaged his car's bumper then. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting off the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a valid reason to be upset. The ex and the friend started dating a year after the breakup. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is mentioned. The friend informed the author, so he's being transparent. The author is distancing themselves because of this.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the friend didn't do anything to prevent the author from moving on. The author might still be in the early stages of getting over the relationship, so being upset is natural. The friend tried to handle it respectfully by informing the author. The author's reaction is about personal feelings, not something the friend did wrong. So the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
