A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she accidentally damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend only reached out to the ex to fix the bumper after a year. That seems like a long time to wait, which might raise some questions. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex, yet proceeded to date her. That could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author is upset and choosing to distance themselves from the friend. Is that justified? Well, if the friend knowingly pursued a relationship with someone the author was still in love with, that's a betrayal of trust. The author had a friend who supported them during the breakup, so the friend's actions might have been particularly hurtful given that context.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex and the friend might have developed feelings after the initial contact, and the friend might not have known the author was still interested. But the author mentioned that they had talked about still having feelings. If the friend was aware and still chose to date the ex, that's a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friend. Is that fair? If the friend acted in bad faith, then the author's response is understandable. But if the friend didn't know the author's feelings, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, the author states that the friend knew they still had feelings. So, the friend's actions were deliberate, which makes the author's decision to step back more justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are whether the friend acted with knowledge and intent. If the friend knowingly pursued the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The author's decision to distance is a personal choice, and they have the right to protect their emotional well-being. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
