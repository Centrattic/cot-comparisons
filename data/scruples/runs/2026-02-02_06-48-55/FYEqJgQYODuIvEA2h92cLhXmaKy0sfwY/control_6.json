I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, the author had a friend over who witnessed the move-out. The ex then got into the friend's car and damaged the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now, they're dating, and the friend told the author, who then decided to distance themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the friend getting involved with the author's ex. The author feels upset and is cutting off the friend. The key points to consider: Did the friend act inconsiderately? The author mentions they have a history of being friends and even met up over the year. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex but still chose to date her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, people often feel hurt when someone close to them dates an ex, especially if there are unresolved feelings. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. The author's response is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. They didn't lash out or confront the friend aggressively; they just stepped back and wished them luck. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was just a casual interaction and didn't realize the author's lingering feelings. But since they had communication over the year, the friend should have been aware. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The friend's decision to date the ex despite knowing the history might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to feel hurt and choose to distance themselves. The friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
