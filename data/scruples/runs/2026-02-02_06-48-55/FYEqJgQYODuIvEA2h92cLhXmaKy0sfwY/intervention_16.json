A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend started dating the author's ex after a year of them being broken up. The author is upset and is cutting off their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their ex ended a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year before contacting her to fix it, and then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because he's upset about it. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex, yet went ahead with dating her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another perspective.\n\nI should consider some factors here. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary. The author had a close friend who knew about their feelings, yet the friend pursued a relationship with the ex. That could be a breach of trust or loyalty. The author's reaction\u2014cutting off the friend\u2014is a personal choice, but is it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend might be within his rights to date whoever he wants. If he told the author he was going to date the ex, maybe the author has the right to be upset. However, if the friend was already aware of the author's feelings and still did it, maybe there's a betrayal there.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they had a buddy over when the ex left, implying they were supported. The friend helped, and then later dated the ex. The author's reaction could be seen as justified because the friend didn't respect the author's feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the time frame. A year after the breakup, the friend contacts the ex. That's a long time, so maybe the friend thought there was no issue. But the author still has feelings, so it's a personal issue. The friend might not have known the author still had feelings, but the author says the friend knew. If he knew, then pursuing the ex is a problem.\n\nThe author's response is to take a step back. Is that being in the wrong? If the friend acted inconsiderately, the author isn't the one at fault for being upset. The friend might be the one at fault for not considering the author's feelings. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the friend's actions are the issue, not the author's reaction.\n\nBut maybe some people would say the author is overreacting. However, the key point is the friend knew the author's feelings. That makes the friend's actions more problematic. The author's decision to distance is a personal choice, and not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
