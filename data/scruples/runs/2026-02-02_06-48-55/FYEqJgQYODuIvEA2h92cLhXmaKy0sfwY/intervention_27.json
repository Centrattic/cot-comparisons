I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) story is at fault for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged their friend's car. The friend waited a year before contacting her to fix the damage. Then they started hanging out and eventually dating. The author felt hurt because their friend knew they still had feelings for the ex, yet went ahead with the relationship. The author decided to stop being friends with the friend.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: They're hurt and choosing to distance themselves because the friend started dating their ex. They might feel betrayed or disrespected, especially since the friend knew about their feelings. Ending the friendship is their way of dealing with the emotional pain.\n\nThe friend's perspective: He waited a year before reaching out to fix the car damage, which might have been a genuine act. He informed the author about the dating to be respectful. The friend might not have realized how much the author still felt for the ex, or maybe he thought time had passed enough.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, people have different reactions to breakups. It's common to feel hurt if someone you care about starts dating an ex you're not over. The author's decision to step back isn't necessarily wrong, as they're prioritizing their feelings. However, maybe the friend didn't intend to hurt them, and the author could consider if there's room for forgiveness or understanding. \n\nBut the key points are: the author communicated their feelings, the friend was upfront, and the author is taking space. It's not about right or wrong, but about emotional response. The author isn't at fault for reacting this way. So I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
