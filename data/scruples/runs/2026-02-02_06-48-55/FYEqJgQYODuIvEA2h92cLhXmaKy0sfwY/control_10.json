I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who's dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car, and then the friend waited a year to contact her. Now they're dating, and the author is cutting ties with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex, which might be why they're upset. It's common to feel hurt in this situation, so maybe their reaction isn't out of line. Friends usually respect each other's boundaries, so the friend bringing up the ex after a year might be crossing a line. But the friend did inform the author first, which shows some consideration. However, the author's response of distancing themselves is a personal choice. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and emotional harm. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset. The friend's actions might have been considerate in informing them, but the situation is sensitive. The author's decision to step back is their right, especially if they're not ready to handle the friend's relationship with the ex. So, the answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
