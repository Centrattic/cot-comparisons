I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset because their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left in a hasty way, damaging their friend's car, and then the friend reached out a year later to fix the bumper. They started hanging out, and now the friend is going on a date with the author's ex. The author feels upset and decides to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotions involved. The author still has feelings for their ex, which their friend knew. The friend contacted the ex to fix the damage and then moved on to dating her. The author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. \n\nIs the author justified in their feelings? Well, the friend knew about the author's feelings. Even though a year has passed, the author might still be hurt. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive because they're dating someone who the author is still emotionally connected to. However, the friend might not have done anything wrong, as the ex was free to move on, and the friend just followed up on a past incident. \n\nOn the other hand, the author choosing to distance themselves is a personal decision. They have the right to feel hurt and want to protect their emotional well-being. The key point here is whether the friend acted in a way that was intentionally hurtful. If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still chose to date the ex, maybe they should have considered the author's emotions more. But if the friend was just being polite and trying to resolve the car damage issue, then maybe they weren't being malicious. \n\nThe author's reaction is to stop being friends, which is a big step. Some might say the author is overreacting, while others might support their right to prioritize their emotional health. The fact that the friend informed the author shows some level of respect, even if the decision to date was made regardless. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, but the action of cutting off the friend might be seen as harsh by some. However, the friend might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings more carefully. The answer depends on the nuances of the friendship and the friend's intentions. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because the author has the right to feel hurt and choose their boundaries.\n"
