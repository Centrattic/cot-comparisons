I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex got back together with their friend after a breakup. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. They broke up a year ago, and the ex moved out. The friend didn't contact her until a year later to fix a damaged bumper. Then they started hanging out. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which the friend knows. The friend is going on a date with her, and the author is cutting ties with him.\n\nHmm. The friend waited a year before reaching out. The author might feel betrayed because the friend didn't contact her sooner, especially after damaging the bumper. But the friend had a valid reason to contact her about the bumper repair. However, the fact that they started hanging out after that could be seen as moving on too quickly. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They're still emotionally attached, and the friend is dating someone they still have feelings for. The author's reaction is to distance from the friend. Is that fair? Well, the friend did know about the author's feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. That could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend had the right to move on after a year. The author's ex is free to date others, and the friend might not have known that the author still had feelings. But the author did mention to the friend they had feelings, so maybe the friend should have been more considerate. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. They're protecting their feelings by stepping back. Cutting off a friend is drastic, but maybe they're justified given the circumstances. The key here is whether the friend acted inconsiderately. If the friend knew the author's feelings and still chose to date the ex, that's a problem. If they didn't know, maybe not. But the author says the friend knows, so the friend's actions are a bit of a betrayal. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to be upset and take distance. The friend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's response is a valid self-protection measure. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
