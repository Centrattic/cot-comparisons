I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. The key points here are the timeline and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the breakup happened a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was an incident where she damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year before contacting her to fix the damage. Then they started hanging out and eventually dating. The author is upset that their friend is dating their ex and decides to distance themselves.\n\nNow, the author still has feelings for the ex. The friend knows about these feelings but chose to date her anyway. The author is cutting contact with the friend because of this. \n\nFrom an emotional perspective, it's understandable that someone would be upset if a friend dates their ex, especially if they're still feeling something. However, the timeline is a year. A year is a significant amount of time, and it's possible the author hasn't fully moved on. The friend did wait a long time to contact the ex, which might suggest he gave space, but once he did, they started dating.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a friend might seem extreme, but if the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still chose to pursue the ex, that's on the friend. The author's reaction is about their own emotions and boundaries. They have the right to decide who they want to associate with. So maybe the friend is at fault here for not respecting the author's feelings, while the author is acting to protect their own emotional well-being.\n\nAlternatively, if the author hasn't given enough time or is holding onto the past, that could be a problem. But a year isn't that long for everyone. The main issue is the friend's decision despite knowing the author's feelings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They have the right to be upset and set boundaries. The friend, however, might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
