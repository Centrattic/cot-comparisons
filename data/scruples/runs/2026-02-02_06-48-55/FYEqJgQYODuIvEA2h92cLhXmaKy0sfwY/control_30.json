I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup and the ex dating the friend. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, the author had a friend over for support. The ex then damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset, cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings: they still have feelings for their ex. The friend knows this but went ahead with the ex anyway. The author is cutting the friend off because of this. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a right to be upset. It's been a year since the breakup. Typically, a year is a long time to still have feelings, but people do have different healing processes. The friend did check in after a year to fix the bumper, which might have been a way to reconnect. The friend knows the author's feelings but chose to date the ex. That seems a bit insensitive, but maybe the friend thought it was okay since it's been a year.\n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. Is this justified? Well, the friend did start a relationship with someone the author is still emotionally connected to. The author might feel betrayed or hurt. It's understandable to be upset, especially if the friend knew. However, cutting off a friend might be an extreme reaction, but emotions can run high in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have known about the lingering feelings, but the author mentioned earlier that they still have feelings. So the friend had that information. Maybe the friend should have considered the author's feelings. But the author is also choosing to end the friendship over this. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend knew about the feelings, the author is cutting off the friend, and the time frame is a year. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to feel upset and set boundaries. The friend's actions might be the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
