A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the friend started dating the ex after she left. The friend damaged the ex's car when she moved out, and now he's going on a date with her. The author told their friend they were stepping back from being friends because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author still has feelings for the ex, which might contribute to their hurt. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about fixing the bumper, then they started hanging out. The friend informed the author about the date, and the author decided to distance themselves.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend knew the author had feelings for the ex but still chose to date her. The author's reaction is to cut off the friendship. Is that fair?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the friend moving on with their ex might feel like a betrayal, especially since they were close. The author's right to feel upset is valid. However, the friend might have thought that a year later, it's okay. But since the author still had feelings, the friend's actions could be insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the author and ex broke up a year ago. In many relationships, a year is enough time for people to move on. However, the fact that the friend was the one who helped the author during the breakup might add another layer. The friend might have been trying to be supportive, but then took advantage of the situation by dating the ex. That could be seen as taking advantage of the author's vulnerable state.\n\nThe author's choice to step back from the friendship is a form of self-preservation. They might feel that the friend crossed a line. The friend could be seen as in the wrong for pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. But the author's reaction\u2014cutting off contact\u2014might seem harsh to some, especially if the friend was just moving on. However, given that the author still has feelings, their reaction is understandable.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, when someone dates an ex of their friend, especially when the friend is still emotionally involved, it's often seen as crossing a boundary. The friend might not have considered how this would affect the author. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset and choosing to distance themselves. The friend's actions might be the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They have every right to feel hurt and to set boundaries. The friend's behavior is questionable, not the author's response.\n"
