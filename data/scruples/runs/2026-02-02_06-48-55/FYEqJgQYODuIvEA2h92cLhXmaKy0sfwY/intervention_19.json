I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA person) is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend after the friend started dating the author's ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: they broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, the friend (let's call him Bob) was present. The ex damaged Bob's car when she left. A year later, Bob contacts her to fix the bumper, and then they start hanging out and eventually date. The author (ITA) finds out and cuts off Bob.\n\nThe author's reasoning: they still have feelings for their ex, and Bob knew that. The author is upset because Bob is dating their ex. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from Bob.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and relationships. If someone is still emotionally attached to their ex, it's understandable to feel hurt if a close friend starts dating them. However, the ex and the author are no longer in a relationship, so Bob's actions aren't necessarily unethical. The author's reaction is about their own feelings, not Bob's actions being wrong.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. If Bob knew the author's feelings and still pursued a relationship with the ex, that could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the author is now choosing to distance themselves. The author isn't doing anything wrong by taking space for their emotional well-being. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Maybe not. People have the right to manage their own emotional comfort. However, if the author was in a relationship with Bob, that would be different. Since they're just friends, Bob might have a right to date whoever he wants. But the author's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Cutting off a friend because they dated an ex isn't inherently wrong, especially if the author still has feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
