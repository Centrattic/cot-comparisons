A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. When the ex left, she damaged their friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the damage, leading to them hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting them off. \n\nThe author mentions they still have feelings for the ex but have been friends with this buddy for a year, talking, gaming, getting drinks. The friend knew about the feelings but chose to date the ex. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend knew about the author's feelings. If the friend had known the author was still interested in the ex, they might have considered that before pursuing a relationship. The author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. \n\nBut maybe the friend didn't realize the author still had feelings? Or maybe the friend thought the author had moved on. However, the author said they've been in contact all this time and mentioned still having feelings. So maybe the friend knew. \n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as disregarding the author's feelings. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. They're not in the wrong for feeling hurt. Relationships can be complicated, and friends should respect each other's feelings. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in their feelings, especially if the friend knew and still pursued the relationship. The author has the right to prioritize their emotional well-being by stepping back.\n"
