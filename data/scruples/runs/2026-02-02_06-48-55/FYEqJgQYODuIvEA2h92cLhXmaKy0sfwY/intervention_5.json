I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: they broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, the friend was there for the author. Then, when the ex left, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is upset and has decided to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nThe author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend knew about these feelings but still chose to pursue a relationship. The author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they might feel hurt or betrayed that their friend is dating someone they still have feelings for. On the other hand, the friend might think they're just helping with the car issue and that the author should have moved on by now. \n\nIs it the author's fault for feeling upset? People have different healing times. The friend might have a right to know the car was damaged, but pursuing a relationship after knowing the author's feelings could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's response is to cut off the friend. Is that fair? Maybe they could have communicated their feelings first instead of immediately distancing. But given the emotional state, it's understandable. \n\nThe key points are the friend's knowledge of the author's feelings and the timing. If the friend knew and still went ahead, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for being upset. They have the right to their emotions. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
