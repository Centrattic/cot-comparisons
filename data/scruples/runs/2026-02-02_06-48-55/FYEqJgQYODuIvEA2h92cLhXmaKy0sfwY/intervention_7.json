I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for distancing themselves from a friend who is dating their ex. The situation involves a recent breakup where the ex damaged a friend's car and then the friend contacted her to fix it a year later. They started hanging out and now have a date. The author is upset and cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still having feelings for the ex, which their friend knows about. The friend reached out to the ex to fix a car damage from a year ago, leading to them dating. The author's reaction is to take a step back from the friendship. \n\nIs the friend wrong for pursuing a relationship with the author's ex? The friend might argue that he had every right to contact her, especially since there was a car damage. The author might feel betrayed because the friend is now dating someone they're still emotionally attached to. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're justified in their feelings of hurt and betrayal. The friend knew about their feelings yet went ahead. However, the friend might not have known that the author still had feelings for the ex. Wait, the author mentions that the friend knows they still have feelings for her. So the friend is aware and still chose to date her. That's a key point. If the friend knew and still pursued the relationship, that's a betrayal of trust. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal boundary, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting if the friend didn't cross any direct boundaries. But since the friend was aware of the author's feelings and chose to date the ex anyway, the author's reaction is understandable. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being by stepping back. The friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the author's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries and protect themselves. The friend's actions might be the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
