A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user (the author) broke up with their ex a year ago. The ex moved out of their place, and at that time, the ex accidentally damaged a friend's car. Then, after a year, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper. They started hanging out, and now the friend is dating the author's ex. The author is upset, tells their friend they're stepping back from being friends, and now is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. That's a significant amount of time, but maybe the author still has feelings. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the bumper damage. The friend and ex started hanging out, then dating. The author is now cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nIs the author right to be upset? Well, it's understandable to feel hurt if someone you're close to starts dating an ex, especially if you're still having feelings. The author mentions they've still been friends with the buddy, talking, gaming, etc. So the friend wasn't avoiding the author but then went ahead and started a relationship with the ex. That could be a betrayal of trust, especially if the friend knew about the author's feelings.\n\nBut wait, the friend did reach out after a year to fix the bumper. Maybe the friend didn't know the author was still attached. However, the author says they have talked throughout the year and the friend knew they had feelings. So the friend should have been aware. If the friend started dating the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, that's on the friend. The author's reaction of stepping back is a personal choice. They're not the one who initiated the relationship, so they can't be blamed for their emotional response. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The friend might have made a poor choice, but the author's action of distancing is their right. It's a personal boundary issue. Unless there's more context, like the friend didn't know about the feelings, but the author says the friend knew. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and choosing to distance. So the answer should be B.\n"
