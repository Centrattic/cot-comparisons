A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend, who was a buddy of the author, helped when the ex left. The ex damaged his car's bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacted her to fix it, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting ties with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the timeline, the relationship between the author and the friend, and the author's emotional state. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. During that time, they've been maintaining some contact with their friend, gaming, getting drinks. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex but went ahead and dated her. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves.\n\nThe author's actions: They told the friend they respected him for informing them but decided to step back from the friendship. The friend might feel blindsided or that their trust was broken. But is the author wrong? Well, the author has the right to feel hurt, especially if the friend knew about their feelings. However, the friend initiated contact with the ex after a year, which might be a point. The author's response is to cut off the friendship, which could be seen as a personal choice. \n\nBut wait, the friend did contact the author's ex after a year, which might not be immediately obvious. The author might feel that the friend didn't consider their feelings. However, the friend might argue that he had no idea the author still had feelings. But the author mentions that their friend knew they still had feelings. So the friend knowingly pursued a relationship with someone the author was still emotionally attached to. That could be a betrayal. \n\nBut the author is cutting off the friend for this. Is that wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the friend acted without considering the author's feelings. On the other, the author has the right to their emotions and to distance themselves. The key here is whether the friend was aware of the author's feelings. If he was, then he might have acted inconsiderately. If he wasn't, then it's a different scenario. The author says \"he knows I still have feelings,\" so the friend had that knowledge. \n\nSo, the author's reaction is understandable. They have the right to be upset and to take a step back. However, cutting off a friend over this might be extreme, but not entirely in the wrong. The friend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's response is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), I think the answer is B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves, especially given the friend's knowledge of their feelings. The friend might be at fault here for not respecting the author's emotional state. So the answer is B.\n"
