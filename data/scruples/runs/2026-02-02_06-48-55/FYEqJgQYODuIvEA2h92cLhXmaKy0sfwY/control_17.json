I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex moved out and damaged the friend's car. Then a year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author is cutting off their friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider emotions here. The author still has feelings for their ex, which is mentioned. It's been a year, but maybe they're not over it. The friend knew about those feelings but still moved on with the ex. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have every right to feel hurt. The friend might have done the right thing by informing them, but the author's reaction is about their own emotional response. The friend's actions\u2014dating the ex despite knowing the author's feelings\u2014could be seen as insensitive. The author isn't the one doing anything wrong; they're just reacting to being hurt. \n\nAlso, the friend and author were friends before the breakup and stayed in contact. The friend's decision to date the ex might have crossed a line. The author's choice to step back isn't about punishing the friend but protecting their own feelings. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in their feelings given the circumstances. The friend might share some blame for not respecting the author's feelings enough, but the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
