I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author finds out, tells the friend they're distancing, and now questions if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author might feel hurt because their friend is dating their ex, especially if they still have feelings. The friend might not realize how this affects the author. The author's response is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nBut is cutting off a friend over this justified? It depends on the context. The author mentions they still have feelings, so it's understandable. However, the friend did inform them, which shows consideration. The author's reaction might be seen as self-centered if they don't consider the friend's perspective. However, the friend did go behind the author's back, even if it was after a year. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, emotions play a big role. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, but cutting off a friend might be a harsh reaction. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given their emotions. Since the friend tried to be respectful by informing the author, the author's reaction might be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. So maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
