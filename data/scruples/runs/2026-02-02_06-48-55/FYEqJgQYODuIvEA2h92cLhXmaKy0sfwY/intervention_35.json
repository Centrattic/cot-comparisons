I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's friend dating their ex. The author ended the relationship a year ago, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The break-up was a year ago, so maybe there's time for moving on, but the author still has feelings. The ex left the author's place, and during that time, the friend was there. The ex damaged the friend's car, and a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix it. They started hanging out, leading to a date.\n\nThe author's friend informed him about the date, and the author decided to step back from the friendship. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and cutting ties.\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for the ex, which the friend knows. The friend is dating someone the author isn't over yet. The friend might have known the author's feelings but chose to pursue a relationship with the ex anyway. \n\nIs the author justified in feeling upset? People have different timelines for moving on. Even if a year has passed, it's possible the author isn't ready. The friend's actions might have been a betrayal, especially if he knew the author's feelings. The author's response\u2014stepping back from the friendship\u2014could be seen as a natural reaction to emotional hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have felt it was right to inform the author. The author's decision to cut ties might seem harsh, but if the friendship was important, maybe the friend should have considered the author's feelings more.\n\nI think the key points are: the timeline, the friend's awareness of the author's feelings, and the author's right to set boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. It's about emotional response and personal boundaries. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
