A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who broke up with their ex a year ago. The ex then started dating the author's friend, leading the author to distance themselves from the friend. The author sent a message to the friend about the upcoming date and then stopped replying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend contacted the ex a year later to fix a damaged bumper. They started hanging out and eventually went on a date. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe friend did contact the ex after a year. The author might feel betrayed, especially since they mention they had support during the breakup. However, the friend's actions might not be malicious. He might have just been trying to resolve the bumper issue. Once the ex started dating him, the author's reaction is to distance. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, it's their right to feel hurt. Relationships are complex, and when someone you care about is dating your ex, it can be emotional. The author isn't attacking the friend or being confrontational beyond saying they'll step back. They respect the friend for informing them. Cutting off contact is a personal choice, and unless the friend did something wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might have overstepped by dating the ex after the author's breakup, but that's not the friend's fault necessarily. The ex is free to date whoever she wants. The author's feelings are valid, but maybe they're overreacting. However, the friend did reach out after a year, so maybe there was some prior interaction that the author wasn't aware of. The key here is whether the friend had any prior communication or intention beyond fixing the bumper. If the friend just wanted to fix the bumper and then the ex took initiative in the relationship, then the friend isn't at fault. The author's reaction is about their own emotional state. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset and choosing to distance themselves. They're not being malicious; they're protecting their feelings. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But I should check if there's any wrongdoing on the author's part, like being overly possessive or if the friend had any prior obligations. The author's friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical. The ex is free to date, so the author's reaction is a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
