I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: they broke up a year ago, the ex left, and during that time the friend was there for the author. The ex damaged the friend's car when leaving. A year later, the friend contacts her to get the bumper fixed, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author found out and decided to distance from the friend. The author is upset because they still have feelings for the ex, but the friend is now dating her.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings and the friend's actions. The friend did inform the author, which is a positive point. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. The author has a right to feel hurt, especially if they still have feelings. However, the friend might not have intended to cause harm. The author is distancing themselves, which is their choice, but is it justified?\n\nThe question is about being in the wrong, not just whether the author is justified in their feelings. The friend might have a right to pursue a relationship, especially after a year. The author's reaction is about personal feelings, but cutting off a friend could be seen as their choice. However, since the friend did inform them, the author's response might be seen as a way to protect their emotions. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? If the ex and friend started dating after a year, that's a reasonable time frame. The author's actions are about their own emotional response, which isn't necessarily the friend's fault. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe the judgment is about whether cutting off a friend is justified. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for their emotional reaction, even if the friend isn't at fault either. The situation is complex, but the author's feelings are valid, so they aren't the asshole.\n"
