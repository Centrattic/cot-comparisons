I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend dated their ex and now the author is cutting ties with the friend.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to get the bumper fixed. They start hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author finds out and tells the friend they'll step back from being friends but wishes them luck. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex, yet chose to pursue a relationship with her. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel betrayed. The friend wasn't just dating someone who was a mutual acquaintance but specifically the ex they had feelings for. Even if the ex was the one to cause the damage a year ago, the friend took the initiative to reach out and start a relationship. \n\nThe friend might argue that he was just fixing up the car and then got romantically involved, but the author had made it clear they still had feelings. The friend should have considered that. \n\nBut is the author overreacting? Maybe the friend didn't think the author would mind, or perhaps they didn't realize the extent of the feelings. However, the author had been friends with the friend and they hung out regularly, so the friend should have known. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is choosing to distance themselves, which is their right. They can decide who they want to be friends with. The friend's actions might have crossed a line, so the author isn't the one at fault here. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend knew the author's feelings, pursued a relationship with the ex, and the author is protecting their own emotional well-being by stepping back. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
