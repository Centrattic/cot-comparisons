I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time the friend was there for support. But when the ex left, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for the ex, which their friend knows. The friend, despite knowing that, started a relationship with the ex. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves. \n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, it's understandable for the author to feel hurt. Even though a year has passed, the friend's actions might be seen as disregarding the author's feelings. The friend had prior contact to fix the car, which could have led to a relationship, but the friend didn't consider the impact on the author. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's actions might be questionable. However, the author is responding by distancing themselves, which is a common reaction when someone is hurt. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're just stepping back. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to their feelings. The friend might be the one in the wrong for not respecting the author's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
