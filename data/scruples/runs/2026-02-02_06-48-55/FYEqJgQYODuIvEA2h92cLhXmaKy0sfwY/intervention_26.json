I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from a friend who is dating their ex.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged her friend's car. A year later, the friend (the one whose car was damaged) contacts the ex to fix the bumper. They start hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend, feeling hurt because the friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex but went ahead anyway.\n\nThe author's actions: They told the friend they respected him for telling them, then stepped back from the friendship. They don't think they're the asshole but want opinions.\n\nSo, the key points are: The friend knew about the author's feelings towards the ex. The friend's car was damaged by the ex, leading to contact. The friend then started a relationship with the ex. The author is upset and cutting ties.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author has the right to feel upset. The friend might have a right to move on, but the issue is whether the friend crossed a line by pursuing the ex while knowing the author's feelings. If the friend was aware the author still had feelings and proceeded, maybe that's where the problem lies. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. Emotionally, they have the right to be upset. However, cutting off a friend over someone else's relationship can be seen as harsh. But given the context, maybe it's understandable. The friend's actions might be the bigger issue here. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their reaction. The answer is B (No).\n"
