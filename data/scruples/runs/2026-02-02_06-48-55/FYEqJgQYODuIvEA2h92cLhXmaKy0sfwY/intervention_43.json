I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person who's upset because their friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up with them a year ago, and during the move-out process, the ex damaged the friend's car bumper. The friend waited a whole year to contact the ex about fixing it, then started hanging out. Now they're going on a date.\n\nThe author is cutting off the friend because they're still upset. They had a relationship, and the friend is now with their ex. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, and during that time, the author and friend stayed in touch\u2014gaming, getting drinks. The author mentioned they still have feelings for the ex. So the friend might not have known about the lingering feelings when he started dating the ex. Wait, the author said they told the friend they still have feelings. So the friend knew. Even with that knowledge, he chose to date the ex. That's a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. Is that justified? Well, trust is a big part of friendships. If the friend knew the author was still into the ex and then went behind their back to date them, that's a betrayal. The author has every right to feel hurt. The friend's actions crossed a boundary by pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. \n\nAlso, the car bumper incident. The ex damaged the friend's car when moving out. The friend waited a year to contact her about it, then started hanging out. Maybe he had a grudge or was waiting for the right time. But after a year, maybe the issue was forgiven. But then he starts a relationship with her, which complicates things. The author might feel the friend is being opportunistic or using the situation for personal gain.\n\nThe key points here: the friend knew about the author's feelings, acted on the ex anyway, and now the author is cutting ties. The author isn't being vindictive; they're setting boundaries. So the friend's actions are the main issue here. The author's reaction is a response to betrayal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
