I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for distancing themselves from their friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, the ex damaged their friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, then they start hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset and wants to distance from the friend.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author still has feelings for the ex. The friend knew about these feelings but decided to date the ex anyway. The author is cutting off the friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend might have crossed a line by dating someone the author is still emotionally involved with. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. The friend had prior knowledge that the author had feelings, so maybe he should have considered that. But the author's decision to step back is their right. They're not obligated to stay friends if it's causing them emotional pain. \n\nThe key here is about respecting boundaries. The friend might have breached the author's boundaries by pursuing the ex despite knowing the feelings. The author isn't wrong for protecting their emotional well-being. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to distance themselves from someone who's dating their ex, especially if it's affecting them negatively. The friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings, but the author's reaction is understandable.\n"
