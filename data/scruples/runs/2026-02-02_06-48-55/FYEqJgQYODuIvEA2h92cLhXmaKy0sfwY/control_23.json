I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this situation. The user is asking whether the person who posted is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend who is dating their ex.\n\nSo the background: They had a breakup a year ago. The friend moved out, and when she left, she backed into his car, damaging it. A year later, the friend contacts her to get that fixed, and then they start hanging out and eventually go on a date. The author is upset, tells their friend they're taking a step back, and stops replying. The friend knows the author still has feelings for the ex, but he's going out with her anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the timing and the actions of both parties. The ex moved out a year ago, so maybe there's a reasonable passage of time. The friend waited a year before contacting her to fix the car damage. Then they started hanging out and now dating. The author is feeling hurt and wants to distance from the friend. \n\nIs the author justified in feeling this way? Well, when someone you still have feelings for starts dating someone you're close to, it's natural to feel upset. The friend knew about these feelings and might have taken that into account. However, the friend might not have realized how much the author still cares, or maybe they thought the timing was right. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing their feelings and setting boundaries. They're not doing anything harmful; they're just stepping back from the friendship. The friend's actions could be seen as a betrayal of trust, since he was aware of the author's feelings. However, the ex was the one who damaged the car and then perhaps reconnected with the friend, which might be out of the friend's control. \n\nWait, the friend waited a year to contact her about the car. Maybe he didn't have malicious intent, just wanted to fix the damage. Then, after that, they started hanging out. The author's reaction is about the friend dating the ex. The friend might have thought that since the breakup was a year ago, it's okay to pursue a relationship. But if the author still has feelings, even after a year, then the friend might have acted without considering the author's emotions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything wrong by expressing their feelings and distancing themselves. The friend might be in the wrong for not considering the author's feelings, but the question is about the author. The author's actions are a response to the friend's actions, so they aren't the one at fault here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to feel upset and set boundaries. The friend might have made a mistake, but the author isn't in the wrong for reacting that way.\n"
