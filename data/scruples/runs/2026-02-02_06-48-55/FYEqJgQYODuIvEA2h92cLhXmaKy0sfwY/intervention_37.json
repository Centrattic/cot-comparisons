I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The main points are: the author and their ex broke up a year ago, the friend (let's call him \"John\") was involved when the ex left, causing damage to his car. A year later, John contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author feels upset and is cutting off John.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex, which is a key point. If someone is still emotionally involved with an ex, they might feel hurt or betrayed if a close friend starts dating them. The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the author made it known they still had feelings. However, the ex and the friend started dating a year after the breakup. That's a significant amount of time, so maybe the ex is allowed to move on. \n\nNext, the friend's responsibility. If the friend knew the author's feelings toward the ex, then approaching her in a romantic way might be inconsiderate. The friend reached out to the ex for a practical reason (fixing the bumper) but then started a romantic relationship. That could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if the friend knew the author's history with the ex. The friend's decision to inform the author is a point in his favor, but the fact that they started dating despite knowing the author's feelings complicates things.\n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friendship. Is that justified? If the friend had been a close friend and the author felt hurt, distancing might be a way to protect their feelings. But is it fair? The friend might have had no idea the author's feelings, or maybe he did. The author mentions that they've talked, gamed, and gotten drinks all year, so the friend likely knew the author's feelings. If that's true, then the friend's actions are the problem, not the author's decision to distance.\n\nHowever, the author could be overreacting. The ex and friend are free to date, even after a year. The author's reaction might be more about their own unresolved feelings rather than the friend's actions. But if the friend knowingly pursued the author's ex, that's another layer of betrayal. \n\nIn summary, the key factors are: the timeline (a year after breakup), the friend's awareness of the author's feelings, and the author's right to feel hurt. If the friend was aware and still pursued the ex, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the friend was unaware, the author's reaction might be harsh. The answer hinges on whether the friend acted inconsiderately, which the author seems to think he did, given their history.\n"
