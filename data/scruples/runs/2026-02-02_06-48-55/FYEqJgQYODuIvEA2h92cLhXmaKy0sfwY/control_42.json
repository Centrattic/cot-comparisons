I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the ex broke up a year ago and moved out. The author had a friend over that day, which provided support. The ex damaged the friend's bumper then. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting them off.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the author's feelings. The author mentions still having feelings for the ex. The friend did inform them about the date, which might be respectful. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. People have different ways of dealing with exes, and it's common to feel upset even after a year. The friend might have a right to date whoever they want, but the author's feelings are valid. However, cutting off a friend because of feelings might be seen as harsh. But maybe not, if the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still chose to date the ex, that could be a betrayal.\n\nWait, the friend did contact the ex to fix the bumper a year later, so maybe they didn't start the relationship immediately. The author had ongoing interactions with the friend, games, drinks, etc. The friend didn't hide the relationship until the date happened. The author's response was to step back but wished them luck. It's a matter of personal boundaries. If the friend knew the author had feelings and still proceeded, maybe the author has a right to be upset. But the friend might have thought the timing was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt and needing space. Friends should respect each other's feelings, so maybe the friend should have considered that. But the author's decision to distance might be a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
