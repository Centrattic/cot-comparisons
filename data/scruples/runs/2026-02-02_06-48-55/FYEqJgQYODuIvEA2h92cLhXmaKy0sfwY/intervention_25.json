I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend dating the author's ex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their girlfriend broke up a year ago. When she left, the author had a friend over for support. The ex damaged the friend's car bumper when she left. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, then they start hanging out and eventually start dating. The author is upset, tells the friend they'll step back from being friends, and the friend is going on a date with the ex. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the main question is about the author's reaction. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe author is hurt because their ex is now dating their friend. Even though it's been a year, they still have feelings. The friend reached out to the ex after a year, so maybe the timing is an issue. The friend might have known the author's feelings, given that they've been talking, gaming, getting drinks all year. So the friend might have been negligent in not considering the author's feelings. \n\nBut the author is cutting off the friend. Is that justified? Well, the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive, but the author's response is to distance themselves. Maybe the author's feelings are valid because they're still emotional. However, cutting off a friend entirely might be a harsh reaction. However, the author has every right to set boundaries. If the friend continued to be a friend while dating someone the author is still connected to, that's a problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The friend's actions might be more in the wrong here. The author is reacting to being hurt. The key points: the friend knew the author's feelings, yet still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might be. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
