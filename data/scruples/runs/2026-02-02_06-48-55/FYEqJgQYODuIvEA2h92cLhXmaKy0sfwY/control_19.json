I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. Then the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and now they're dating. The author is cutting off the friend and wants to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. A year has passed since the breakup. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex. The friend, who was there for the author during the breakup, now is dating the ex. The author feels upset and decides to step back from the friendship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend had the right to move on. The author's feelings are valid, but cutting off a friend might be a personal choice. The key points are: the friend was honest by informing the author, and the author is reacting emotionally. The friend didn't interfere during the relationship; they just got back in touch after the breakup. The author isn't wrong for feeling hurt, but maybe the response of cutting off the friend is abrupt. However, the friend's actions aren't malicious. The author's reaction is more about their own unresolved feelings. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and their boundaries.\n"
