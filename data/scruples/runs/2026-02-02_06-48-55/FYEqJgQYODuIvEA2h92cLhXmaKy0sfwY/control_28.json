I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she hit the friend's car, damaging the bumper. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it. Then they started hanging out and are now dating. The author is upset, tells the friend they're stepping back, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's feelings and the friend's actions. The author has feelings for the ex and is hurt that their friend is dating her. The friend waited a year to address the car damage, which might have been to give time for things to settle. But then they started dating. The author cutting off the friend because of it\u2014should they be upset?\n\nWell, the friend did reach out after a year to fix the bumper, which seems reasonable. Then they started a relationship. The author's reaction is understandable because they're still emotional about the breakup. But is it fair to cut off the friend? The friend didn't know the author still had feelings. Wait, the author says their friend knows they still have feelings for the ex. So the friend chose to date someone the author is still connected to. That could be a breach of friendship, maybe. But maybe the friend thought it was okay.\n\nThe author's response is to distance themselves. Is that wrong? If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still proceeded, maybe the friend is at fault. But the author's reaction is justified if they're hurt. However, cutting off a friend over this might be extreme, but it's their choice. So, the answer depends on whether the friend acted inconsiderately. Since the friend knew the author's feelings and still dated the ex, maybe the friend is the one in the wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. So the answer is B.\n"
