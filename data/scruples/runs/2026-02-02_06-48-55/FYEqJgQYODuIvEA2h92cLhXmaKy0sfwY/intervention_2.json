I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's friend dated their ex-girlfriend after a breakup, and the author is upset and cutting ties with the friend. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The friend and the ex started hanging out after a year, and the friend told the author about the date. The author then decides to distance themselves. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend knew about these feelings but still pursued the ex.\n\nIs the author right to be upset? Well, the friend did approach the ex after a year, which might be after some healing time. However, the friend knew the author still had feelings, so maybe approaching the ex was inconsiderate. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend, which is a personal choice but might be a bit harsh. However, the friend did inform the author, showing some consideration. The author's actions are about protecting their own feelings, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's awareness of the author's feelings and the timing. If the friend approached the ex knowing the author still had unresolved feelings, that's a problem. The author's response is a personal boundary, which is their right. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that the author is overreacting. But given the friend's knowledge, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). Need to check if there's any other factors I missed. The damage to the bumper was a point, but that might be irrelevant here. The main issue is the emotional response and the friend's actions. I think B is the right answer here.\n"
