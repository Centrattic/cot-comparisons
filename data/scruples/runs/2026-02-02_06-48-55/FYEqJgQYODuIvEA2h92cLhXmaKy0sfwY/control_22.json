I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper. They started hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset, told their friend they're stepping back, and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotions involved. The author still has feelings for their ex, which they mentioned to their friend. The friend knew about these feelings yet pursued a relationship with the ex. That seems like a breach of trust, right? Friends usually respect each other's boundaries. The author's reaction is understandable because they were emotionally vulnerable. \n\nThe friend's actions might have crossed a line. Even though it was a year later, the friend's decision to date someone the author still cares about could be seen as insensitive. The author's choice to distance themselves is a personal decision to protect their feelings. \n\nBut then again, maybe the friend didn't realize the depth of the author's feelings. However, the author did mention still having feelings, so the friend should have known. The damage to the car was a past issue, but the friend waited a year to address it, which could be a red flag. \n\nI think the main issue is the friend's lack of consideration for the author's emotions. The author isn't wrong for being upset. They have every right to step back if this situation is causing them pain. The friend's actions led to the conflict, so the author isn't the one at fault here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
