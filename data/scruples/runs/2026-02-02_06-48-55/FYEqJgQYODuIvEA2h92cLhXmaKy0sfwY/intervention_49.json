I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the ex moved out and damaged the friend's car. Now, a year later, the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset and cutting off their friendship. \n\nFirst, the author and the ex broke up a year ago. The author had a friend over for support when the ex left. The ex damaged the friend's car bumper at that time. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the damage, then they started hanging out and are now dating. The author is upset and cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The person wants to know if they're the asshole for being upset and distancing themselves.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is mentioned. The friend knows about these feelings but proceeds to date the ex anyway. The author feels betrayed and is cutting ties. \n\nI think people have different boundaries here. If the friend was aware of the ongoing feelings and used that to his advantage to start a relationship with the ex, maybe that's not cool. But the author's reaction is cutting off the friend. Is that fair?\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a legitimate reason to contact the ex (fixing the bumper). It's been a year, so maybe the timing of contacting her was just about the car. But the friend started hanging out with her after that. The author might feel that the friend took advantage of the situation. \n\nBut the author is cutting off a friend because the friend is dating their ex. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong? It depends on the context. If the friend was actively undermining the author or being sneaky, maybe. But the friend did tell the author upfront about the date, so maybe he's being respectful. The author might feel that even with the friend's honesty, it's still hurtful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author's choice to distance themselves is their own decision, maybe they're not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. However, if the friend's actions were respectful and the author is overreacting, perhaps the author is in the wrong. But given the emotional context of still having feelings for the ex, maybe the author's reaction is justified. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend was honest, the author had feelings, and the author is choosing their own response. The friend didn't do anything to manipulate the author, but the author's feelings are hurt. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
