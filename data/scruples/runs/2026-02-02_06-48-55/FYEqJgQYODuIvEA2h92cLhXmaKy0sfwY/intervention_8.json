I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left quickly, damaging the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off their friendship because of this.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the author's feelings. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend reached out to fix the car damage, which seems reasonable. Then they started hanging out. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which complicates things. The friend was aware of the author's feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. \n\nNow, the author is upset and cutting off the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the friend's perspective, he might feel that he's moving on and it's his right to date whoever he wants, even if the author still has feelings. However, the friend did inform the author about the date, which shows some level of consideration. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice but might be seen as cutting off a friend over a situation that, while hurtful, is also a year old.\n\nBut wait, the author is still emotionally involved. If they still have feelings for the ex, maybe the friend didn't realize the author wasn't over it. However, the friend did reach out to inform them, so he might have respected their feelings to some extent. The author might feel betrayed, but it's been a year. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have a right to pursue a relationship, especially if the author and ex were already broken up. The author's reaction could be seen as taking things personally, especially if they haven't fully moved on. However, the friend's actions might have crossed a line if he knew the author still had feelings.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is choosing to cut off a friend because the friend is dating someone the author was involved with, even after a year. While it's understandable to be upset, the author might be in the wrong for not moving on and letting it affect their friendship. However, if the friend knew the author still had feelings and proceeded anyway, maybe the friend is also at fault. But the post is about the author's actions. The author's choice to distance themselves might be justified if they're not ready to handle it, but maybe it's their issue to work through. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author is holding onto the past. If they still have feelings and the friend is moving on, it's more about the author's unresolved emotions. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but cutting off a friend over it could be seen as their choice. However, the friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate if he knew the author's feelings. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If the author is cutting off a friend because they're dating their ex, and a year has passed, maybe the author is in the wrong for not moving on. However, if the friend knowingly pursued the ex despite the author's feelings, then the friend is in the wrong. Since the post asks if the author is in the wrong, and the friend informed them about the date, the author's reaction is a personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves, given the friend's actions and the author's unresolved feelings.\n"
