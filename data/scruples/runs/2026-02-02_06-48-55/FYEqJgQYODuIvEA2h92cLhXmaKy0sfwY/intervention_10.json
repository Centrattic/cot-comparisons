I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex moved out a year ago, damaged a friend's car when she left, and then the friend waited a year before contacting her to fix the bumper. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset, cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one who was in a relationship with the ex, which ended a year ago. The friend, let's call him Friend A, had the ex damage his car when she moved out. Then, a year later, he contacts her to fix it, and they start hanging out. The author is upset because they still have feelings for the ex, and now their friend is dating her. The author is cutting off Friend A because of this.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid. They're still emotionally involved with their ex, and their friend went ahead and started a relationship with her. That's a breach of trust, especially if the friend knew about the author's feelings. The author might feel betrayed, even if the friend didn't do anything illegal. The act of pursuing someone who is still a sensitive subject for the author could be seen as crossing a line. Also, the timing: after a year of broken up, the author was moving on, but then the friend reconnected with the ex. That could add to the hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, Friend A might not have known about the author's lingering feelings. The author mentions that they've talked and hung out with the friend throughout the year, so maybe they never communicated that they still had feelings for the ex. If Friend A wasn't aware, he might not be at fault. However, even if he didn't know initially, once he started dating the ex, he should have considered the author's feelings. The fact that he waited a year to contact her after the breakup might be to fix the car damage, which is a practical reason, but then moving into a romantic relationship seems opportunistic if he knew about the author's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author is taking a stand by distancing themselves from Friend A. Is that justified? If the friend knew or should have known that the author still had feelings, then pursuing the ex could be seen as taking advantage. But if the friend was genuinely unaware, then maybe the author needs to communicate better. However, the author does say that the friend knows they still have feelings, which complicates things. If the friend knew and still went ahead, that's a problem. The author's right to be upset is valid because their feelings were known to the friend. The friend's actions could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nBut the ex and the friend's relationship: the ex left the author, then the friend helped her move, there was a car incident. Then a year later, the friend contacts her to fix the car. The timeline is important. A year is a significant time, and maybe the author should have moved on. However, the fact that the friend waited a year to contact her could mean he wasn't immediately interested but the car issue came up. But then, after that, he started pursuing her. The author might feel like the friend is taking advantage of their ex after the breakup, especially if the author is still healing.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no rule against dating an ex of a friend. But emotionally, it's a sensitive situation. The friend's actions might not be wrong in a moral sense, but they could be seen as insensitive. The key points are whether the friend knew about the author's feelings and whether the author's reaction is reasonable.\n\nSince the author mentions that the friend knows they still have feelings, but the friend went ahead anyway, that's a problem. The friend's decision to date the ex despite knowing the author's emotional state is where the fault lies. The author is within their rights to be upset and to distance themselves from the friend. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their emotional well-being. The friend's actions are more questionable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
