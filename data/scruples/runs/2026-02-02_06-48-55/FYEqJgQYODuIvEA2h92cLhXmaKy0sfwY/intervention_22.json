I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's friend dating their ex after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and during that time, the ex damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about fixing the bumper. Now, they're dating, and the friend told the author, who then decided to distance themselves. The author is upset and is wondering if they're the asshole for cutting off the friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The choices are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the key points here. The ex and the friend started dating after a year. The friend did inform the author, which shows some consideration. The author is still having feelings for the ex, which complicates things. The author's reaction is cutting off the friend. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend did wait a year to contact the ex, which seems reasonable. The author's main issue is that the friend is dating their ex. But the author's choice to distance themselves is a personal decision. The friend didn't do anything wrong by dating someone; the author might be taking it personally. \n\nHowever, the friend did reach out to inform the author, which is a positive step. The author's reaction might be harsh, especially if the friend wasn't the one who broke up with the ex. The author's feelings are valid, but the friend isn't at fault for moving on. \n\nBut the author is also within their rights to decide their own social boundaries. If the author feels hurt, they can choose to take a step back. However, maybe the friend should have waited longer, but a year is a significant time. \n\nIn terms of the friend's actions, there's no malice. The author's feelings are personal, but the friend isn't wrong for moving on. So the author's reaction might be seen as overreacting. However, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nThe key point is that the friend is the one who told the author first and waited a year. The author's choice to distance is their prerogative, but the friend isn't at fault. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
