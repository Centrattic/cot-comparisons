I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend dating the author's ex. The author broke up with their ex a year ago, and during the breakup, there was some damage to the friend's car. The friend waited a year and then started hanging out with the ex again. Now the author is upset and cutting off the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup happened a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which adds some emotional context. The friend, after a year, contacts the ex about fixing the bumper and then starts seeing her. The author feels betrayed because the friend knew about their feelings but still pursued a relationship with the ex.\n\nI should think about the boundaries between the author and the friend. The friend knew the author was still emotionally involved with the ex. Even though it's been a year, if the author was clear about their feelings, the friend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary. Also, the fact that the friend waited until a year later to approach the ex might suggest that timing was a factor. The author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend, which is their choice, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for being upset.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's responsibility. If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still chose to date the ex, maybe the friend was in the wrong. However, unless there were explicit boundaries set, the friend might not have known it was off-limits. But the author says they've talked, gamed, and gotten drinks, implying an ongoing friendship where the author's feelings were known. In that case, the friend might have acted inconsiderately by pursuing the ex.\n\nThe author's decision to step back is a personal choice, but cutting off a friend over dating an ex can be complex. However, given that the author was clear about their feelings and the friend proceeded anyway, the author's upset reaction seems understandable. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
