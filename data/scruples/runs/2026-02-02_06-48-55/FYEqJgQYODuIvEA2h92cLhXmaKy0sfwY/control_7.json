I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is an asshole for being upset with their friend for dating their ex.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The ex moved out a year ago, and during that time, the author and their friend have kept in touch\u2014gaming, getting drinks, etc. The friend and ex started hanging out after the friend finally contacted her about fixing a damaged bumper. Then they're going on a date, which the friend informed the author about. The author responds by saying they'll take a step back from the friendship but wishes the friend luck.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings about their ex and their friend's actions. The author mentions they still have feelings for their ex, which probably makes the situation more personal. The friend knew about these feelings but went ahead with the relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, their reaction is about respecting their own emotions and boundaries. They might feel hurt or disrespected by the friend's decision, especially since the friend waited a year to contact the ex but then started dating her. The author choosing to distance themselves could be seen as a way to protect their own emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that it's none of the author's business now that they're exes. The friend could feel they're allowed to date whoever they want, regardless of the author's feelings. However, the fact that they informed the author shows some level of consideration, even if the author still feels upset.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have the right to date whoever they choose after a breakup, even if it's someone close to the ex. But the friend knew about the author's lingering feelings, which complicates things. The author's decision to step back isn't out of anger but to manage their own emotions, which is a valid response.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're prioritizing their emotional health, and the friend's actions, while not necessarily wrong, might have been handled differently. The friend's choice to inform the author was a good move, but the situation itself is tricky. The author's reaction is about personal boundaries, which is important. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
