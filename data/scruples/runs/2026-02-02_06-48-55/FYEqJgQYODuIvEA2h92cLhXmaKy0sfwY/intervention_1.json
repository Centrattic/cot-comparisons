I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: The ex moved out a year ago, and during that time, the author had a friend over who later got in touch with the ex. They started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings towards the ex. They mention they still have feelings for her. The friend knew this but still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author feels wronged and is distancing themselves from the friend.\n\nNow, considering the friend's actions. The friend waited a year to contact the ex after the breakup, which might be seen as a long time, but the friend had a legitimate reason to contact her (fixing the bumper). The friend didn't know about the ex's feelings towards the author, but the author had mentioned still having feelings to the friend. So, the friend might have known or at least should have considered the author's feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. Is that justified? If the friend knowingly hurt the author by pursuing the ex, then the author's response makes sense. However, if the friend didn't realize the author's feelings and acted without malice, the author might be overreacting. But since the author had already communicated their feelings to the friend, the friend's actions could be seen as dismissive or careless.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships can be complex. The author has every right to feel hurt and to choose their boundaries. The friend's actions might not be malicious, but the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their emotional well-being. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
