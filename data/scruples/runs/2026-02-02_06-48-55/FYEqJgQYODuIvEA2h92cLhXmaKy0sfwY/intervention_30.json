A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex damaged their friend's car when she left, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author decided to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and their ex broke up a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend had a damaged car bumper, which the ex caused, and a year later the friend contacted her to fix it. They started hanging out and eventually went on a date. The author, who still has feelings for the ex, is now upset with the friend and has decided to step back from the friendship.\n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the analysis.\n\nLet me break it down. The main ethical dilemma here is about the friend's actions. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex, yet chose to date her. The author is upset and cutting off the friend as a result. Is that justified?\n\nFirst, the friend's actions: he had a damaged car from the ex, and after some time, he got in touch. He might have had a legitimate reason to contact her for repairs. But the key point is whether he was aware that the author had lingering feelings. The author says the friend knows they still have feelings, yet he went ahead and started dating her. That could be seen as crossing a boundary. If the friend knew the author's feelings, then pursuing a relationship with the ex could be considered thoughtless or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have considered the author's feelings, or perhaps the author didn't communicate clearly that they didn't want the friend to pursue a relationship. The author might be overreacting if the friend didn't intentionally harm them. But since the friend was aware of the feelings, it's more of a betrayal. The author's response is to cut off the friend, which is a personal choice, but is the author in the wrong for that?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often expect empathy for the hurt feelings. The author is hurt, and the friend's actions might have been inconsiderate. The author's reaction of distancing themselves is a way to protect their own feelings. However, is it fair to cut off the friend entirely? That's a personal choice, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's the case. If the friend knowingly pursued a relationship with someone the author was still emotionally attached to, then the friend might be at fault. The author's decision to step back could be a justified response to protect their own emotional well-being. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
