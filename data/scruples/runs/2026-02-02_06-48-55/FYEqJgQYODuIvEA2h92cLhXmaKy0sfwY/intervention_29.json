I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend, who was a buddy, helped the author when the ex moved out and ended up damaging the car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is upset, tells their friend they're stepping back from the friendship, and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend knew about these feelings yet chose to pursue a relationship with the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have thought that since it's been a year and the author hasn't mentioned any issues, that it's okay to date the ex. But the friend was aware of the author's feelings and then went ahead. That could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is reacting to the friend's actions. The friend did reach out to the ex to fix the bumper, which was a practical matter. But then moving from fixing the car to dating seems like a step too far when the author is still involved emotionally. The author's response is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. The friend knew about the author's feelings. 2. The friend initiated contact with the ex for a non-romantic reason initially but then started dating. 3. The author is now cutting the friend off. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend might have acted without considering the author's feelings, but the author is reacting in a way to protect their own emotions. However, cutting off a friend entirely might be seen as harsh if the friend didn't realize the implications. But if the friend was aware and still proceeded, maybe the author is justified. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend approached the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, the friend might be at fault. However, the author is responding to that. Depending on cultural norms and personal boundaries, the author's reaction could be seen as reasonable. \n\nIn some views, the author is within their rights to distance themselves. However, others might argue that the friend didn't intentionally lead the ex on and that the author is overreacting. But given that the friend knew the feelings and still went ahead, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend crossed a boundary knowing the author's feelings, leading the author to distance themselves. The author isn't the asshole for reacting that way.\n"
