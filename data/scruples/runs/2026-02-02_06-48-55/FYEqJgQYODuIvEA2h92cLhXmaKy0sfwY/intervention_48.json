I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex, who they broke up with a year ago, got back into their friend's car and damaged the bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is upset and is cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex. The friend, who was present when the ex moved out, saw the damage then but waited a year to contact her. Now they're dating. The author is upset and cutting ties with the friend.\n\nThe author's reaction is to distance from the friend. Is that justified? Well, the author's feelings are valid\u2014they're hurt because their ex is moving on with someone they consider a friend. But the friend might not have known about the author's feelings when they started seeing the ex, especially since the contact was initiated after a year. The author had been in contact with the friend throughout the year, so the friend might not have been aware of the lingering feelings.\n\nHowever, the friend did reach out to the ex for a valid reason (fixing the bumper) and then started hanging out. The author is upset because they feel the friend is taking advantage of the situation. But cutting off a friend because they're dating an ex, even with unresolved feelings, is a personal choice. The author's actions are about their emotional response, not necessarily something the friend did wrong.\n\nThe key points: The author is in a difficult emotional situation. The friend's actions might not be malicious, but the author is handling their hurt by distancing. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on context. The friend might have a valid reason for contacting the ex, and the author's reaction is about their feelings. Since the friend didn't know about the author's feelings (as they were still friends), the author isn't the asshole for being upset. They're reacting to personal hurt, which is subjective. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
