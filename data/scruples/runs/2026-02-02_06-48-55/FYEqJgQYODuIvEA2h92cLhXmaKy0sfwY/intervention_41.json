I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, there was some car damage incident, and the friend (who was there for support) later contacted the ex to fix the damage. Now, they're dating, and the author is cutting ties with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex, which they mentioned to their friend. The friend knew about these feelings yet chose to date the ex. That's a red flag. Friends should respect each other's boundaries and emotions. If the friend was aware of the author's unresolved feelings, pursuing a relationship with the ex could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. Is that justified? Well, the friend might not have intended to hurt the author, but they disregarded the emotional state of their friend. The author has the right to feel hurt and to take steps back if they feel disrespected. \n\nHowever, the friend might have thought that a year after the breakup was a safe time to pursue the ex, especially since the author and ex were already separated. But the key point is that the author made their feelings known. If the friend knew and still went ahead, that's a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The friend's actions disregarded the author's emotions. The author's response is a legitimate way to protect their feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
