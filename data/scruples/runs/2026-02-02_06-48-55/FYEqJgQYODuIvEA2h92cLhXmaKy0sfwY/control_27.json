A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and there was an incident where she damaged the friend's car bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacted her to fix the damage, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting ties with the friend because they're upset. The author says they still have feelings for the ex, but the friend knew that and still went ahead.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The author is upset because the friend is dating their ex. The friend told them about the date, and the author decided to distance. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, the author's right to feel upset. It's natural to feel hurt or angry if someone you're close to starts dating someone you had feelings for. The author mentions they still have feelings, which adds to the emotional aspect. The friend knew about these feelings, which might make the situation worse because the friend could have considered the author's feelings.\n\nThe friend's actions: He waited a year after the breakup to contact her to fix the car, and then they started hanging out. The author might feel like the friend took advantage of a situation (the damaged bumper) to get close to the ex. But a year is a significant amount of time. The author's ex moving out and the incident with the bumper might have been the catalyst for them reconnecting. However, the timing of the friend's actions is questionable if he knew the author still had feelings.\n\nNow, the author's response: They told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship. Is that justified? People have the right to set boundaries if someone's actions are causing them emotional distress. Even if the friend didn't intentionally cause harm, the author has a right to feel hurt and take space for themselves.\n\nIs the author the asshole? Well, the friend knew the author's feelings and still pursued the ex. That's a point against the friend. The author's reaction is a personal choice to protect their emotional well-being, which is understandable. The author isn't trying to control the friend's actions but is choosing to distance themselves because they're upset. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The friend might share some responsibility for not being more considerate of the author's feelings.\n\nAnother angle: The author's right to be upset is valid, but cutting off a friend over this might be a personal choice. However, it's their choice to make, and they aren't obligated to continue a friendship that's causing them pain. The key is that the author is acting on their emotions, which are legitimate given the circumstances. The friend's actions might have been insensitive, which could contribute to the author's decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Their feelings are valid, and they have the right to set boundaries. The friend's actions might be the issue, not the author's response.\n"
