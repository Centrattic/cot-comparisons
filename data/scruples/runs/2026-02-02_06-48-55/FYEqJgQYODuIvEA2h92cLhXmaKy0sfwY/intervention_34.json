I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, there was an incident where she damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend, cutting off communication.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The key points here are the timeline, the friend's actions, and the author's reaction. \n\nThe author had a close relationship with the friend and the ex together. They mention still having feelings for the ex, which might affect their judgment. The friend reached out to the ex a year later, which is a significant amount of time. The author is upset and decides to cut off the friend, but does that make them the asshole?\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Friends are supposed to be supportive and honest. However, the friend didn't hide the relationship. He informed the author when he found out. The author's response was to cut off the friend, which could be seen as a personal choice. But is it justified?\n\nThe author's upset is understandable, especially if they still have feelings. The friend might not realize the depth of the author's emotions. However, the friend did reach out to fix the bumper a year later, which might have been a genuine attempt to resolve the issue. The fact that they started dating only recently could be a factor. \n\nThe author's decision to step back is their choice, but cutting off a friend over this might be seen as harsh. However, considering the emotional impact, it's a valid reaction. The friend's actions were honest, but the author's feelings are their own to manage. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about perspective. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the way they handled it by cutting off the friend could be seen as extreme. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I have to decide between A or B.\n\nGiven that the author's reaction is based on their own feelings and the friend was honest, the author isn't necessarily the asshole. They have the right to their emotions. However, if the question is about being in the wrong for cutting off the friend, it's a personal choice. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author did anything unethical. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
