I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex damaged the friend's car when she left, and now the friend is dating her. The author is cutting off the friend because of it.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. It's common to feel hurt or upset when someone close to you starts dating an ex, especially if there are lingering feelings. The friend did reach out to contact the ex after a year, which might have been part of the problem. The author is taking a step back from the friendship as a result. \n\nThe friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. That's a key point. If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still chose to pursue a relationship with the ex, that could be seen as insensitive. The author is reacting to being hurt, which is a natural response. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might believe that the author should be over it by now, but a year isn't that long. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. Deciding to take a step back from the friendship is a personal choice, and the user is asking if that makes them the asshole. \n\nThe friend's actions\u2014starting a relationship with someone the author is still emotionally attached to\u2014could be the main issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing their own emotional well-being. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
