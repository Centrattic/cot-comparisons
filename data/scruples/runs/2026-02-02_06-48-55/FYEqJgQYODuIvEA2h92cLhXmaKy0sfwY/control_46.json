I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. The friend didn't contact her until a year later to fix the bumper, then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and the friend were close, still talking and hanging out. The author has feelings for the ex, even after the breakup. The friend reached out to the ex about the car damage, which might have been a responsible thing to do. Then they started dating, which the author finds upsetting. \n\nIs the author justified in being upset? Well, the author might feel betrayed or hurt that their friend is dating someone they're still emotionally attached to. But the friend did inform them, which shows some respect. The author is choosing to distance themselves, which is their right. But is it the friend's fault? The friend might have thought it was necessary to resolve the car issue and maybe saw a connection. However, if the author was still in love with the ex, the friend should have been more cautious. \n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the friend's actions. The friend waited a year to address the car issue, which might not be immediately relevant. The author's decision to cut off the friend is their personal choice. It's about boundaries and how the author feels about their friend moving on with someone they still have feelings for. \n\nI think the author is within their rights to feel upset and to distance themselves. They expressed respect for the friend's communication and then made a choice that's right for them. The friend might not be at fault either, as they had a reason to contact the ex. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
