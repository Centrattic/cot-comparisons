A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves two friends: the author and their friend. The author's ex moved out a year ago, and during that time, the ex damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset that their friend is dating their ex and wants to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They broke up a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions still having feelings for the ex, which might explain their upset. The friend, knowing about these feelings, still decided to date the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the friend's actions might be questionable. If the author had made it clear that they still had feelings and didn't want the ex to be with someone else, the friend might have been in the wrong. However, the author's friend didn't know about the feelings until the author mentioned it later. Wait, the original situation says the author told the friend they still had feelings. Wait, no, looking back: the author says, \"He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.\" So the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still pursued the relationship. \n\nIn that case, the friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's emotions. But the author is cutting off the friend, which is their choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by cutting off a friend. People have the right to distance themselves if someone is causing them emotional pain. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author still has feelings for their ex, which the friend knew about. 2) The friend started dating the ex despite this. 3) The author is taking a step back from the friendship as a result. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Probably not. The friend's actions might be more questionable, but the author's reaction is a personal choice. People can choose their friends and manage their own emotional well-being. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
