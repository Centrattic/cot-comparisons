I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left and accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings. They mention they still have feelings for their ex. The friend knew this but chose to date her anyway. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend might have overstepped by dating someone the author is still connected to. The author's reaction is about protecting their emotional well-being. The ex's actions (damaging the car) might be a red herring here unless it's part of a pattern of behavior, but the main issue is the friend's decision to pursue the ex despite knowing the author's feelings.\n\nThe friend's transparency in informing the author is a point in their favor, but that doesn't negate the author's right to feel hurt. People in such situations often take time to move on, and the friend might have underestimated the lingering emotions. The author isn't obligated to remain friends if it's causing them distress. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
