I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend started dating the author's ex-girlfriend. The friends had known each other for a year since the breakup, and the author still had feelings for the ex. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about fixing a bumper that was damaged when she left. Then they started hanging out and eventually dated. The author is upset and decided to step back from the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and the context. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions they still have feelings, so that's a key point. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, which might suggest he was giving space and not rushing into anything. The author's ex damaged his car when she left, so the friend contacting her to fix it seems reasonable and responsible. Then they started hanging out, which might have been a natural progression, especially if they were friends before.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: he's upset and cutting off the friendship. Is that justified? Well, the friend did inform him about the date, which shows respect. The author is reacting to the fact that the friend is dating his ex, even though there's no indication the friend was trying to interfere or be insensitive. The author has a right to feel hurt, but cutting off a friend over this might be seen as a personal choice. However, the friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical; he just pursued a relationship with someone who was previously the author's partner. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone dates an ex, it's generally considered a sensitive situation, but it's not uncommon. The key factors here are the friend's actions. Did he act in a way that's malicious? It doesn't seem so. He waited a year, contacted her for a valid reason, and informed the author. The author's feelings are valid, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction is disproportionate. Cutting a friend off because the friend dated his ex might be a personal choice, but it's not necessarily wrong. On the other hand, if the friend had knowingly tried to get the ex back immediately after the breakup, that might be different. Here, the friend waited a year and approached it respectfully.\n\nSo, the author's feelings are valid, but his reaction might be seen as a personal decision rather than being in the wrong. The friend didn't do anything to deserve blame, so the author isn't necessarily the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The friend knew the author still had feelings but went ahead anyway. Does that make the friend at fault? Maybe, but the author's reaction is about his own feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the friend. So, if the author is just cutting off a friend because they dated his ex, it's his choice. He's not in the wrong for being upset or distancing himself.\n"
