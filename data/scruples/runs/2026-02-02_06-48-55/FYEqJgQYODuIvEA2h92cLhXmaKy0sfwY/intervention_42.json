I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The situation started with a breakup a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is now cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, the author still has feelings for their ex. That's important because it adds emotional context. The friend did inform the author about the date, which is a respectful move. The author is choosing to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and stepping back.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and personal boundaries. The friend made an effort to inform the author, so he's not trying to hide anything. The author's reaction is about their own feelings and needing space. While the author might feel betrayed or hurt, cutting off a friend because of their romantic choices isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to set boundaries, especially if they're still emotionally involved. The friend didn't do anything to intentionally hurt the author beyond dating the ex, which is a personal choice on his part.\n\nHowever, the argument could be made that the author is overreacting by cutting off a friend because of the friend's dating life. But considering the author's history and feelings, it's a valid reaction. The friend didn't steal the ex or do anything malicious beyond the initial car damage, which was an accident. The author's action is about protecting their own emotions, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has every right to feel upset and set boundaries. The friend was upfront, and the author's response is about their own emotional well-being.\n"
