I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. When the ex left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, then dating. The author found out and decided to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex. The friend knew this but chose to date the ex anyway. The author's reaction is to stop being friends. Is that reasonable?\n\nThe friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. The author appreciated that but then chose to distance. People have the right to date someone else after a breakup, even if the ex is still in love. However, the friend knew about the author's feelings, which complicates things. The friend might have a responsibility to consider the author's feelings, but it's not clear if the ex's actions were intentional in getting back at the author.\n\nThe author's action of stepping back is their choice. They are allowed to feel upset and take space. The friend might not be in the wrong for dating someone, but the author is not in the wrong for feeling hurt and adjusting their friendship. So, the answer is B.\n"
