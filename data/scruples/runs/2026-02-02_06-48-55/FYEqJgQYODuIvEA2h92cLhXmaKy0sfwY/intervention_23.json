I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago. When the ex moved out, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off their friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend didn't reach out until a year later to fix the bumper. Then they started hanging out and now dating. The author still has feelings for the ex, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nThe author's friend is aware that the author has feelings for the ex. Despite that, the friend is proceeding with the relationship. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves.\n\nI think the key points here are about boundaries and respect. The friend knew about the author's feelings but chose to pursue a relationship with the ex. That could be seen as crossing a personal boundary. The author has every right to be upset if their friend violated an unspoken agreement or expectation not to pursue a relationship with the ex. However, the author is choosing to end the friendship, which might be a strong reaction. But given the emotional investment and the friend's awareness of the situation, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that since a year has passed, it was okay. But if the author had made it clear they still had feelings, then the friend's actions were disrespectful. The author's decision to distance themselves could be a reasonable response to protect their own emotions.\n\nThe person who answered thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The friend's actions were disrespectful, so the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
