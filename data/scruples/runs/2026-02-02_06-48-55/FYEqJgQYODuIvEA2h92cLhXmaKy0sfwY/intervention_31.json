I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with their ex a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she accidentally damaged her friend's (the author's buddy) car bumper. Then a year later, this friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date now. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole for being upset and stepping back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The author mentions they still have feelings, which might mean the emotional recovery isn't complete. The friend, after a year, reaches out to the ex to fix the bumper, which could be seen as just a practical matter. They started hanging out, maybe becoming friends again, and then dating. The friend informed the author, and the author is upset and cutting ties.\n\nThe author is upset because the friend is dating their ex. But they had a year since the breakup. The friend might not have known about the author's lingering feelings. The ex moved out and left, causing the car damage. The friend was just handling the repair, which is a reasonable action. The author's reaction might be about their own unresolved feelings rather than the friend's actions. The friend told the author to be respectful, so maybe the friend is trying to be considerate. The author is choosing to distance themselves, which is their right, but does that make them the asshole? \n\nThe key points are: the time since the breakup, the friend's actions (fixing the bumper, then dating), and the author's emotional response. The friend didn't do anything immediately after the breakup; it's been a year. The author's feelings are valid, but cutting off a friend over this might be seen as harsh. However, the friend did inform the author, which is good. The author's decision to step back is their choice, but is it wrong? Maybe not. The friend isn't at fault for dating someone else, especially since the author and ex were already separated. The author's feelings are personal, but the friend isn't obligated to avoid the ex. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend did act appropriately by informing them, and the author is responding to their own emotions. However, the friend's actions in dating the ex are separate from the author's feelings. The author's reaction is about their own situation, not the friend's actions. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
