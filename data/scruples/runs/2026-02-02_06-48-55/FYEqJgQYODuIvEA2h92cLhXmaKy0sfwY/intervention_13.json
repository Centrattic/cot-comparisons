I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend was there when the ex moved out, and the ex damaged his car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is cutting off the friend.\n\nHmm, the author says they still have feelings for the ex. The friend knew about these feelings but still went ahead with the ex. The author is upset and stepping back from the friendship. \n\nFirst, the friend's actions: he waited a year after the breakup to contact the ex. The author had already been broken up for a year, so maybe there's some time passed. But the author is still in love, so even after a year, maybe the wounds are still fresh. The friend knew about the feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. That seems a bit insensitive, but maybe the friend thought the author had moved on.\n\nThe author's response is to cut off the friend. Is that justified? Well, the friend did contact the ex a year later. The author might feel betrayed because the friend was present during the breakup and even helped the author during that time. The friend's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if the author was still emotionally involved.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for cutting off the friend? The author has the right to feel upset. Friendship is about mutual respect. If the friend knew the author still had feelings and proceeded, maybe the friend is at fault. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice and their right. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the friend might have thought the author had moved on, and the author's reaction is a bit harsh. But given the context, the author's feelings are valid. They might need space to deal with this. The answer would depend on whether the friend acted inconsiderately. Since the friend knew the author still had feelings, going ahead with the ex could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves. So answer B (No).\n"
