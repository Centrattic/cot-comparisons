I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex had a breakup a year ago, and the friend helped out during that time. The ex damaged the friend's car when moving out, and a year later, the friend contacted her to fix it. Now they're dating, and the author is cutting ties with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author is still having feelings for their ex, which was mentioned. The friend, knowing this, still chose to date the ex. That's a key point. While the friend might have a right to move on, the author is hurt and wants to distance themselves. Is that a valid reaction?\n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. He knew the author's feelings but proceeded with the relationship. The author's response is to step back from their friendship. Is that justified? Well, the author has the right to their emotions. If the friend had no idea about the feelings, maybe it's different, but in this case, the author says the friend knows they still have feelings.\n\nBut wait, the friend might have felt that since a year has passed, it's okay. However, the fact that the ex damaged his car and then he waited a year to contact her suggests there might have been some lingering connection or forgiveness on the friend's part. So the friend's actions might not be malicious, but they are causing the author pain.\n\nIs the author overreacting? They might be, but they also have the right to protect their emotional well-being. The key here is whether the friend acted inconsiderately. If the friend knew about the feelings and still went ahead, then maybe the friend is at fault. However, the author's decision to cut off the friendship is a personal choice. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe their reaction is too extreme. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's actions could be seen as causing intentional hurt, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
