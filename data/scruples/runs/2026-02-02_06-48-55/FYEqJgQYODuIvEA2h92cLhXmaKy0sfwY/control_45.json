      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and during that time, she damaged her friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix it, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author's friend told them about the date, and the author decided to distance themselves from the friend, feeling upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the author's reaction. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend only contacted the ex to fix the bumper after a year, which seems like a reasonable delay, maybe waiting for the right time or until the author was over it. The friend then started hanging out with the ex, which the author finds upsetting because they still have feelings. \n\nThe author is cutting off their friend because of this. Now, is the author right to do so? Well, the friend did inform the author, which is respectful. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they might not be ready to see their ex moving on. However, the friend might have moved on and found someone else, which is normal. The author's reaction could be seen as holding onto past feelings, but it's also about personal boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend didn't do anything malicious; he contacted the ex to fix a damage and then dated her. The author's response is about their own emotions. The friend might have known the author still had feelings, but he proceeded anyway. However, the author chose to distance themselves, which is their right. \n\nIs the author the asshole? It's a bit of a grey area. The friend might have overstepped if he knew the author still had feelings, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings. Since the breakup was a year ago, maybe the author should have let go by now. But it's okay to still have feelings after a year. The friend's actions might be acceptable, but the author's choice to step back is about their emotional state. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to feel upset and set boundaries based on their emotions. The friend's actions don't necessarily make them wrong, but the author isn't in the wrong for reacting how they did.\n"
