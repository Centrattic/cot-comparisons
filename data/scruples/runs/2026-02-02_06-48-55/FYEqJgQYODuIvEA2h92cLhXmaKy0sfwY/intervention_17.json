I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from their friend who dated their ex.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out of the author's place, and during that time, there was an incident where the ex damaged their friend's car bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and now dating.\n\nThe author's friend is taking the ex out on a date, and the author is upset, leading them to step back from the friendship. The question is whether the author is an a**hole for that reaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another perspective. \n\nI need to consider a few things here. First, the author still has feelings for their ex, which is valid. The friend, however, reached out after a year to fix the bumper, which might have been a reasonable action. Then the friend started seeing the ex, which the author finds upsetting. \n\nThe author's response was to distance themselves from the friend. That's their right, but is it wrong? Well, the friend might have had a legitimate reason to contact the ex (fixing a car damage), and the author's reaction might stem from lingering feelings and not the friend's actions being malicious. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? The friend might not have known about the author's feelings, but since the author mentioned they still have feelings to the friend, the friend might have proceeded knowing that. However, the friend could also argue they were just fixing a past issue and then forming a relationship. \n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings are valid, the friend's actions might not be malicious, but the author's reaction (stepping back) is a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset about someone they care about being with their ex. However, cutting off a friend because they dated an ex could be seen as harsh, depending on the circumstances. \n\nBut the friend did reach out after a year, not immediately after the breakup. The author might feel betrayed, but if the friend didn't know about the ongoing feelings, it's not entirely their fault. However, the author's friend might have known, given that they were still friends and talked/gamed with the author. \n\nIn this case, the author's reaction is understandable, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line, but it's not malicious. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
