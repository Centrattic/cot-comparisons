I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset at their friend for dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the ex left in a rush, damaging the friend's car. Then, a year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex. It's been a year, but maybe the healing process isn't complete. The friend knew about the feelings but went ahead and started a relationship with the ex. That could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe friend waited a year before contacting the ex. Maybe he had to deal with the car repair, which took time. But the author might feel that the friend took advantage of the situation after the breakup. The author's response was to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. Is that justified?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The friend might not have known the author was still in love, but the author did say they had feelings. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, the author is choosing to end the friendship over this, which could be a personal decision. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong here. Emotionally and socially, the friend might be at fault for moving on when the author wasn't over it. The author's reaction is understandable. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
