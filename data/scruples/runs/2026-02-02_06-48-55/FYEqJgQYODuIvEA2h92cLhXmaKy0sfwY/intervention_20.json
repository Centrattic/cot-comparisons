I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left after damaging the friend's bumper, and then the friend contacted her to fix it. They started hanging out and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The author mentions they still have feelings, which might be a factor. The friend reached out to the ex to fix the bumper a year later, which led to them getting back in touch. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset enough to distance themselves.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's reaction is understandable. It's common to feel upset when someone you care about dates an ex, especially if you're still emotional about the breakup. The friend did inform the author, which shows some respect. The author choosing to take a step back isn't necessarily wrong because they have the right to set boundaries to protect their emotional well-being.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? The friend and author were still friends after the breakup, so perhaps the friend didn't expect the author to still feel that way. However, the author has the right to prioritize their feelings. The friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical; they just dated someone the author is still connected to. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend informed them and the author is choosing to distance themselves, it's a personal choice. The author isn't being malicious; they're protecting their feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
