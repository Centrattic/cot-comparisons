I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from a friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left in a situation where she damaged the friend's car, and the friend later contacted her to fix the bumper. A year later, the friend told the author that he's dating the ex now. The author, who still has feelings for the ex, decided to step back from being friends with this friend. They're questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the author's emotional response. The breakup was a year ago, which gives time for healing, but the author still has feelings. The friend didn't act immediately; he waited a year to reach out about the car damage, and then they started hanging out. The author might feel hurt or betrayed because the friend is dating their ex, especially since they were close friends who gamed and had drinks throughout the year.\n\nI need to consider if the friend acted inconsiderately. The friend knew the author had feelings for the ex but still pursued a relationship. The friend did inform the author, which is a positive step, but the action of dating the ex could still be seen as insensitive. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're reacting to someone who they were close to now dating someone they have feelings for. The friend might not have realized the depth of the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back isn't out of line because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. The friend's actions might not be malicious, but they did engage in a relationship that caused the author pain. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and choosing to distance. The answer should be B (No).\n"
