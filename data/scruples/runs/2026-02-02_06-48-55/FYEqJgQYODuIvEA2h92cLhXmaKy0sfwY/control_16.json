I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author has a friend who dated their ex. They broke up a year ago, and when the ex moved out, she damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her about the bumper, then they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset, told their friend they're stepping back from the friendship, and the friend is going on a date with the ex. The author is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for being upset and distancing.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend was present when the ex left, maybe providing support. The ex damaged the friend's bumper that day. Then, after a year, the friend contacts the ex to fix the damage, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they still have feelings for her.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me think about the dynamics here. The author's friend started dating their ex. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. Is that justified? Well, the friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. So if the friend was aware of that, then pursuing a relationship with the ex could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the ex is free to date whoever she wants, but the friend's actions might have hurt the author, especially since they were friends.\n\nBut the friend waited a year to contact the ex. Maybe the author thought they were over it, but the friend knew they still had feelings. Also, the initial damage to the car\u2014maybe that's a red herring. The friend waited a year before approaching the ex, which might have given the author time to move on. But the author hasn't, and now the friend is dating the ex. \n\nFriendships often have boundaries. If the friend knew the author's feelings and still pursued the ex, that could be a breach of trust. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. It's not necessarily wrong to be upset if a friend is dating someone you still care about. However, is cutting off the friend immediately justified? It depends on the context. Maybe the author feels betrayed, which is valid. But the friend might feel that the author is overreacting since a year has passed.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is free to date others, and the friend might not have known the author's feelings were still so strong. But the author states that their friend knew they had feelings. So the friend's actions could be seen as using the author's vulnerability. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for someone to feel hurt and want to distance themselves if their friend is involved with an ex they care about. The key is whether the friend acted in bad faith. If the friend knew the author's feelings and still pursued the ex, that's a betrayal. The author's reaction is a personal boundary, which is their right. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
