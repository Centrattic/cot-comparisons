I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a girlfriend who moved out a year ago. The friend (let's call him Friend A) was there when they broke up. The ex-girlfriend damaged his car's bumper when she left. A year later, Friend A contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset and wants to distance from Friend A.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings: They still have feelings for the ex, which is understandable since it's only been a year. Friend A knew about these feelings but still pursued a relationship with the ex. That's a key point. The author is cutting off Friend A because of this. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, Friend A did tell the author about the date, which is a nice gesture. The author respected that but decided to step back. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries. Friend A might have thought that since a year had passed, it's okay. But the author isn't over it yet. The problem is that Friend A pursued someone who was recently ex of their friend. But was he wrong? Maybe not, since they were broken up. However, knowing that the author still had feelings could be a factor. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from Friend A. Is that fair? It's their choice to protect their feelings. Friends can have different actions based on their own emotions. So the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to manage their emotional well-being. Friend A might have made a mistake by pursuing the ex knowing the author's feelings, but the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to that.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
