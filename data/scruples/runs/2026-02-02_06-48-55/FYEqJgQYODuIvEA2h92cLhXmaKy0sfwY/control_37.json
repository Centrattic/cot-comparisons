      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the ex and the friend started hanging out after a year since the breakup. The friend informed the author, and the author decided to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The ex broke up with the author a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author's friend was friends with the author, and they had some social interactions. The friend's car was damaged when the ex moved out, and a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix it. They started hanging out, and eventually, the friend told the author they're dating. The author then cut off the friendship.\n\nThe key points here are the timing and the friend's actions. The friend waited a year to contact the ex to fix the car damage. That seems like a reasonable time to address a practical matter. However, starting a relationship with the ex so soon after the breakup might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if the author still has feelings. The friend did inform the author, which shows some level of consideration, but the author feels betrayed and decides to distance themselves.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author has every right to feel hurt if their friend started a relationship with their ex, especially if the friend knew about the author's feelings. The friend's decision to inform the author is a positive step, but the act of pursuing the ex might still be hurtful. The author choosing to distance themselves is a personal choice, and it's their right to do so if they feel it's necessary for their emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have known the extent of the author's feelings, or they might have believed that a year was enough time. However, even if a year has passed, the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive if they knew the author still had unresolved feelings. The key here is whether the friend was aware of the author's feelings. The author mentions that the friend knows they still have feelings but is proceeding anyway, which could be a point against the friend.\n\nIn terms of the author's reaction, cutting off a friend is a serious step, but it's a personal choice. The question is whether the author's feelings are valid. Given that the friend pursued the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, it's understandable that the author would feel upset. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for distancing themselves. The friend's actions might be more questionable here.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The friend's decision to date the ex, especially knowing the author's feelings, could be the issue here. The author's response is a personal choice to protect their emotions.\n"
