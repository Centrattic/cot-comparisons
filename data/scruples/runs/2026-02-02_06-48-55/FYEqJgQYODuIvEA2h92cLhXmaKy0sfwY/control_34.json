I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a friend who dated their ex. They broke up a year ago, and during the breakup, the ex damaged the friend's car. Now, the friend finally contacted the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out again. The friend then informed the author they're dating, and the author cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. They still have feelings for the ex, so this is a sensitive situation. The friend did reach out after a year to fix the car damage, which might have been a polite thing to do. But the timing of when they started dating matters. The author might feel betrayed because the friend is now with someone they're still emotionally attached to. \n\nBut wait, the ex moved out a year ago, and the friend waited until now to contact them. The author's friend did inform them before the date, which is a respectful move. The author decided to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. Is it wrong to be upset? People have different coping mechanisms. The author might feel that the friend took advantage of the situation or didn't respect their feelings. On the other hand, the friend might have thought the breakup was final and the ex is now free to date anyone. \n\nThe key points here: the author's right to feel hurt, the friend's honesty in informing them, and whether the friend acted inconsiderately. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, and choosing to distance is their prerogative. The friend did the right thing by telling them. So the answer is likely B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
