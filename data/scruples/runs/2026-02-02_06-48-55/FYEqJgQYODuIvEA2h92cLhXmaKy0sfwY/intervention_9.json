I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend a year ago. She left and damaged their friend's car. Then, the friend (the buddy) contacted her a year later, they started hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend because he's dating the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author still has feelings for the ex, which they've told their friend. The friend knew that but still started a relationship with the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of it.\n\nIs it wrong for the author to be upset? Well, the author is within their rights to feel hurt. The friend might have crossed a line by pursuing the ex after knowing the author's feelings. The timing is a year later, so maybe the author felt they had moved on, but clearly, they still have feelings. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have moved on by now, and it's their own issue with not letting go. Also, the friend might have had no idea about the author's lingering feelings. But the author did tell the friend, so the friend had that information.\n\nThe author's decision to step back from the friendship is their choice. Whether they're in the wrong depends on if the friend's actions were a betrayal. If the friend was aware and still proceeded, maybe the author isn't wrong to be upset. But if the friend thought the author had moved on, maybe the author is overreacting. However, since the author explicitly mentioned their feelings, the friend should have been cautious.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to be upset given the circumstances. The friend's actions were disrespectful considering the author's known feelings.\n"
