I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now he's dating her. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for the ex, which they mentioned. The friend knew about these feelings. The friend and ex started hanging out after a year, initiated contact for the car damage, and now are dating. The author is cutting the friend off as a result.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, people have the right to feel upset when someone they care about dates an ex, especially if they still have feelings. The friend knew about the author's feelings but still chose to pursue a relationship with the ex. That could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the friend might have thought they were just fixing the car issue and hanging out, not expecting it to lead to a relationship. But the fact that the friend waited a year to contact the ex after the breakup might be a point in his favor. \n\nOn the author's side, they might feel betrayed or hurt. Cutting off a friend is a strong reaction, but it's their choice based on their emotional state. The key is whether the friend acted inconsiderately. Since the friend informed the author about the date, he tried to be respectful. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, and while it's a significant action, it's not necessarily wrong if the author feels it's necessary for their well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
