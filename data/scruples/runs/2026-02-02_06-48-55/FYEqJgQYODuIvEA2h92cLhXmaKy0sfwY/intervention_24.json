I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend started dating their ex. So the situation is: the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left and damaged their friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the author's ex. The author is upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a relationship with the ex, who then left. The friend was present when the ex left, maybe providing support, which is understandable. The ex damaged the friend's car, and later the friend reached out to fix it. Over time, they started dating. Now the author is cutting the friend off because they're upset about this.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings towards the ex. They mention still having feelings for the ex, even a year later. The friend knows this but proceeds to date the ex. The author is now distancing themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to feel hurt. It's natural to be upset when a close friend dates an ex, especially if there are lingering feelings. The friend might have thought they were handling it respectfully by informing the author, but the author still feels betrayed or disrespected. The author's decision to step back is a personal choice, and it's their right to decide their comfort level in friendships.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have acted without considering the author's feelings. Even though the author mentioned having feelings for the ex, the friend could have been more sensitive about the situation. However, the author's ex is a free agent, and after a year, it's possible the ex moved on. The friend might not have intended to cause harm but did so nonetheless.\n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're expressing their feelings and choosing to distance themselves. People have the right to their emotional responses. The friend's actions might be the root cause, but the author's reaction is a personal choice. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're responding to hurt feelings. The friend might have misjudged the situation, but the author's actions are justified as a self-protective measure. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
