A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex after a year.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago, the ex moved out, which was tough but the author had support from their friend (let's call him Friend B). The ex damaged Friend B's car when she left. Then, a year later, Friend B contacts the ex to fix the bumper. After that, they started hanging out and now are dating. The author found out through Friend B's message and decided to distance themselves, calling it a step back in friendship. The main question is whether the author is the asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings and their reaction. The author mentions they still have feelings for their ex. Friend B knew that but still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is upset and wants to distance from Friend B. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author's feelings are valid. Even if a year has passed, if they're still not over the ex, the friend's actions could be seen as a betrayal. The friend had knowledge of the author's unresolved feelings and chose to date the ex anyway. That could be considered insensitive or thoughtless. \n\nHowever, Friend B might have thought the author was over the ex by now, especially since a year has passed. But the author made it clear they still had feelings, so maybe the friend should have been more cautious. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. They're not obligated to continue the friendship if it's causing them emotional pain. \n\nThe ex damaged the car initially. Friend B waiting a year to mention it is interesting. But the ex's action was an accident, and Friend B might have just wanted to resolve the issue. Then, their interactions leading to a date complicates things. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt and choosing to protect their emotions. Friend B might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings, especially if they were aware of them. The author's response is within their rights to take a step back. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
