I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's friend dating his ex. The ex broke up a year ago, moved out, and during that time, the friend was present when she left, and she damaged his car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset, tells his friend he's stepping back from their friendship, and the question is if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for his ex, which he mentioned. His friend reached out to the ex to fix the car damage, which happened a year prior. The friend knew about the author's feelings but proceeded to date her anyway. The author is cutting off the friend as a result.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line. The author's ex was in a relationship with him, and the friend might have had some knowledge about their breakup. If the friend knew the author still had feelings, and maybe even knew the ex was still in the author's life, then pursuing a relationship could be seen as taking advantage. However, the friend did contact the ex to fix the damage, which was a past issue. If the friend didn't know about the author's feelings, maybe it's not his fault. But the author says his friend knew he still had feelings. That's a key point.\n\nThe author's reaction is to distance himself from the friend. Cutting off someone can seem harsh, but if the friend knowingly went against the author's feelings, maybe the author has a right to be upset. The question is whether the author overreacted. On one hand, people can't control others' relationships, but if the friend knowingly hurt the author, the author's reaction is justified. \n\nBut is the author the asshole? If the friend didn't have any malicious intent and just ended up dating someone who was previously in a relationship with the author, maybe the author is being unreasonable. However, since the author's feelings were known to the friend, the friend's choice to pursue the ex could be seen as insensitive. The author's decision to step back might be a legitimate response to protect his emotional well-being. \n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole?\" posts, the community often looks at intent and whether the reaction is proportional. Here, the friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, especially if he was aware of the author's feelings. The author's reaction, while cutting off a friend, might be seen as a reasonable boundary given the circumstances. So the author might not be in the wrong. But I need to make sure not to make assumptions. The key points are the friend knowing the author's feelings and proceeding anyway. If that's the case, the friend's actions were disrespectful, and the author's response is justified. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
