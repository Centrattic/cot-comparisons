I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up a year ago, and there was some incident where the ex damaged the friend's car when she left. Now the friend contacted her about fixing it, and they started hanging out and dating. The author is upset and is cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend knew that the author still has feelings for the ex. The friend then starts dating the ex. The author is upset and is distancing themselves from the friend. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's friend is the one who is dating the ex. The author is reacting by cutting off the friend. Is that justified?\n\nIn many relationships, when someone breaks up, they might still have lingering feelings. The friend knew that the author had feelings for the ex. So, if the friend is aware of that, is it fair for him to date the ex? That's a point. The author might feel betrayed or hurt because the friend is dating someone they were still emotionally connected to. \n\nOn the other hand, the author and ex are no longer a couple. The friend is free to date whoever he wants, even if the author is still in love with the ex. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend, but is that the right move? The friend might have a different perspective, thinking he's just moving on and that the author should do the same. \n\nThe author's actions: they told the friend they respect him for informing them and then stepped back. The friend might not have asked for the author's permission, but the author is choosing to end the friendship. Is that fair? It's a personal choice, but maybe the author is overreacting because the relationship is over. The friend might have a right to pursue a relationship with someone he knows is free to date. \n\nBut the friend's knowledge of the author's feelings complicates things. If the friend was aware the author was still interested, then pursuing a relationship could be seen as taking advantage. However, the author and ex were broken up for a year, so the friend might have thought it's okay. \n\nThe author's right to be upset is valid, but cutting off a friend over this might be a personal choice rather than something objectively wrong. So, is the author in the wrong? The answer could hinge on whether the friend acted inconsiderately, but since the ex is free to choose, the author's decision to distance themselves is a matter of personal boundaries. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B."
