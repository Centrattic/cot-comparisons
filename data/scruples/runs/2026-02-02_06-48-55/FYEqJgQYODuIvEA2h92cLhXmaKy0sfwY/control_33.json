      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their friend broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts her to get the bumper fixed, and they start hanging out again, leading to a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's feelings. They still have feelings for their ex, which isn't unusual after a breakup. The friend contacting the ex after a year to fix the bumper seems practical, but then they started dating. The author is upset because their friend is now dating someone they have feelings for, even though the ex broke up with them. The author respects the friend for informing them but decides to step back. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. The friend had every right to contact their ex for a practical matter, like a car repair. Maybe they reconnected after that. The author's reaction is about their own emotions. It's valid to feel hurt or upset in this situation. However, cutting off a friend because they dated an ex might be a personal choice. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but is it wrong to distance themselves? Relationships can be complex. If the author and the friend had a good relationship, maybe there's a way to talk it out. But the author chose to step back, which is their right. The friend might feel blindsided, but the author's feelings are genuine. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with their emotions, and it's okay to set boundaries if they feel uncomfortable. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
