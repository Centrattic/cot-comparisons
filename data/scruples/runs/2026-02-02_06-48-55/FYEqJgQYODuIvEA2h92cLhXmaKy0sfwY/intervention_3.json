I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago, and the friend who was involved in the initial break-up (since the ex damaged his car) is now dating the ex, which makes the author want to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still upset about the breakup and hasn't fully moved on. The friend reached out after a year to fix the car damage and then started hanging out with the ex. Now they're going on a date. The author is cutting off the friend in response. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend did inform the author, which is respectful. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they might feel hurt or betrayed. But is cutting off a friend over this considered wrong? It depends on perspective. The author has the right to distance themselves if they're not ready to accept the situation. However, the friend might have thought they were being honest by informing the author. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but whether cutting off the friend is the right move is debatable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe not everyone will agree. The friend's actions might be seen as intrusive if they knew the author still had feelings. But the author's reaction is a personal choice. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to feel hurt and choose their boundaries. It's their personal decision, and not everyone will see it as wrong to take a step back from a friend who's dating an ex, especially if the breakup is recent.\n"
