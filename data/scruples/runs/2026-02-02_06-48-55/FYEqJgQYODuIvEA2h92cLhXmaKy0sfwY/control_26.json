I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a breakup with their ex a year ago. Their friend was involved in the breakup, maybe because the ex damaged his car. Then, a year later, the friend contacts the ex and they start dating. Now the author is upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, the author is still having feelings for their ex. That makes sense\u2014breakups can take time. The friend, who had the car damaged, contacted the ex after a year and started dating her. The author is upset because they feel the friend is taking advantage of their ex when the author still has feelings. \n\nThe friend did inform the author about the date, which is good. The author then says they'll distance themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and cutting off the friend. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to feel hurt. Their ex just started dating someone who was involved in the breakup. The friend might have a right to date whoever they want, but approaching someone's ex after a year could be seen as crossing a line. But it's been a year, so maybe the ex is free to move on. \n\nThe author is cutting off the friend because of this. Is that fair? If the friend knew the author still had feelings, maybe they should have considered that before dating the ex. But the friend might have thought enough time had passed. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable, but does that make them in the wrong? It's about boundaries. The author is choosing their own boundaries, which is their right. The friend acted without considering the author's feelings, perhaps. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves. They have the right to protect their feelings. The answer would be B (No).\n"
