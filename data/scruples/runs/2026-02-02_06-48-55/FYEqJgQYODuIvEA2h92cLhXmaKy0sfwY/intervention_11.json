I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation involves a breakup a year ago, some damaged property, and the friend contacting the ex to fix it, leading to them dating. The author then decides to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. It's natural to feel upset when someone you care about dates an ex, especially if you still have feelings. The key points here are the timeline and communication. The breakup was a year ago, and the author mentions they've been friends with the buddy, gaming and getting drinks. The friend waited a year to contact the ex to fix the bumper but then started dating her. \n\nThe author's decision to step back from the friendship is a personal choice. They expressed respect for being informed, which shows they tried to handle it maturely. The friend knew about the author's feelings but still pursued the relationship. While the author might feel betrayed, the action of cutting ties isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed it earlier. But given the time that's passed and the friend's actions, the author's reaction is understandable. The main issue is whether the friend overstepped, not the author. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
