      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend dated their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the friend started dating the ex after she left her place. The friend told the author they're going on a date, and the author is cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their ex broke up a year ago, so some time has passed. The friend, who was a buddy of the author, contacted the ex to fix the bumper and then started hanging out. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves because they still have feelings for the ex. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Emotionally, it's natural to feel hurt or upset when someone close to you dates an ex, especially if you're still in love. The friend did inform the author, which is a point in their favor. The author's reaction is to step back from the friendship, which is a personal choice. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, people might have different opinions. Some might say the author is justified in their feelings, while others might think it's an overreaction. The key points here are the friend's actions\u2014did they overstep by dating the ex? The author's right to feel upset because their feelings weren't considered. The friend's action of informing the author could mitigate some blame, but if the friend knew the author still had feelings, maybe they should have been more considerate.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're choosing to distance themselves. The friend's actions are the trigger. The author's response is about their emotional reaction, which is subjective. In terms of right or wrong, there's no clear moral wrong here. The author is allowed to feel upset and make choices based on their emotions. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid emotional response and are taking steps to protect their own feelings.\n"
