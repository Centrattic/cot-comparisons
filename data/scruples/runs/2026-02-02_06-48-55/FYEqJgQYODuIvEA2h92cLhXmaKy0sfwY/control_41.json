I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a breakup a year ago, and their friend moved out. Then, the friend's buddy (who's now dating the ex) came over, and when the ex left, she damaged his car's bumper. A year later, the buddy contacts the ex to fix the bumper, starts hanging out with her, and now they're dating. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend because of this. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. That's a significant amount of time, so maybe the author's feelings have cooled down. But the author still has feelings for the ex, which they mentioned. The friend, who they had been in regular contact with (talking, gaming, getting drinks), now introduces the ex into the mix. The friend knew the author still had feelings but went ahead to date the ex. \n\nWait, actually, the friend here is the one who is now dating the ex. The buddy is the one who the author is friends with. So the author's friend (the buddy) contacted the ex after a year, fixed the bumper issue, started hanging out, and now is going on a date. The author tells the friend (the buddy) that they're going to take a step back. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though the breakup was a year ago. The friend knew about the author's feelings. The author is cutting off contact now. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author's reaction is justified. People have the right to move on and date someone else, even if they were previously in a relationship with someone else. However, the friend (the buddy) might have acted without considering the author's feelings. The author might feel betrayed because the friend knew they still had feelings for the ex but proceeded to date her. \n\nBut a year has passed. The author might have moved on, but clearly, they haven't. The friend might not have intended to hurt the author, but the fact that they started dating the ex after knowing the author's feelings could be seen as insensitive. However, the friend isn't required to avoid dating someone the author is still emotionally attached to, unless there was a prior agreement. \n\nThe author's decision to step back from the friendship is their choice, but is that making them the asshole? Or is the friend the one in the wrong for pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings? \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable for someone to date an ex, even if another person still has feelings. However, the friend's awareness of the author's feelings could make their actions seem more problematic. \n\nBut the author is choosing to distance themselves, which is their right. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. If the author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, and the friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the friend is. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting because a year is enough time to move on. But people's emotional timelines vary. The author might not be in the wrong for their reaction. They have the right to feel hurt and want to distance themselves. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings, but the author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
