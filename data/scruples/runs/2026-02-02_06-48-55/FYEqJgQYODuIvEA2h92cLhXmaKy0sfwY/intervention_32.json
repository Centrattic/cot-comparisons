I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex moved out a year ago, damaged their friend's car in the process. Then, this friend, who the author has been friends with, reached out to the ex after a year to fix the bumper. They started hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset that their friend is dating their ex, even though they still have feelings for the ex, and they're cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The author had support from their buddy during the breakup, which is good. The friend's car was damaged then, and a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix it. Then they start hanging out and dating. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which is a key point. \n\nThe author is upset because their friend is dating someone they're still emotionally attached to. They're choosing to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're dealing with lingering feelings. It's understandable to feel hurt if someone close to you is now dating an ex, especially if they knew about the feelings. The friend knew the author had feelings for the ex, yet still pursued the relationship. That could be seen as a betrayal, which might justify the author's reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't know the author still had feelings? Wait, the author says the friend knows they still have feelings. So the friend knowingly pursued a relationship with someone the author cares about. That could be a red flag. \n\nThe author's response is to end the friendship. Is that too harsh? Well, if the friend crossed a line by pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, then the author has every right to step back. People have different boundaries, and if those are violated, it's acceptable to take a stand.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? The ex and the friend only started dating after a year. The author hasn't completely moved on, which is normal. But is it the friend's fault? If the friend was just fixing the car and then naturally developed a relationship, maybe there's no malice. However, the friend did wait a year to contact the ex, which gives time for the author to heal. Yet, if the friend approached knowing the author's feelings, that's a problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect their emotional well-being. The friend's actions might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
