I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she accidentally damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author found out and distanced themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was in a relationship with the ex, which ended a year ago. The friend helped during the breakup and was present when the ex left. The ex damaged the friend's car then. Now, the friend and ex are dating, and the author is upset, cutting off the friend. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex but went ahead anyway. \n\nSo, the key points: The author's ex is now with their friend. The author feels wronged and is cutting ties. Is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not. The author isn't the one who started the relationship. The friend knew about the author's feelings and still chose to date the ex. The author's reaction is understandable as it's a betrayal of trust. Friends typically don't date each other's exes, especially when the friend is aware of the emotional state. The author isn't at fault for being upset. The friend's actions are questionable here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
