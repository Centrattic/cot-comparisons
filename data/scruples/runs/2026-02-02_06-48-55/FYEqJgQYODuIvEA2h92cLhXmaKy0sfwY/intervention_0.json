I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The ex moved out a year ago, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author found out and decided to distance themselves from the friend. They're wondering if they're the asshole for being upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The ex causing damage to the friend's car at the time of moving out seems like a minor incident, but the friend didn't reach out to fix it until a year later. Then, they started hanging out and now are dating. The author still has feelings for the ex, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nThe key points here are the timing of the friend's actions. The friend waited a whole year after the incident to address the damage, which might suggest that the main intention wasn't just to fix the bumper but perhaps to reconnect with the ex. The author feels betrayed because their friend is now dating their ex, even though the author is still not over the ex. \n\nThe author's response is to step back from the friendship. Is that justified? Well, the friend did know that the author still had feelings for the ex. If the friend was aware of that, then pursuing a relationship with the ex could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's decision to distance themselves might be a reaction to feeling used or disrespected. \n\nHowever, the friend might have a different perspective. Maybe he didn't realize how much the author still cared, or he thought it was okay since the breakup was a year ago. But given that the author had communicated their feelings, the friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. It's understandable to feel hurt when a friend dates an ex, especially when there's unresolved feelings. The decision to distance is a personal choice and not necessarily wrong. The friend, on the other hand, might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings. \n\nSo, in terms of the question, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n"
