A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the friend who had a car accident with the ex is now dating her. The author is cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. However, the author still has feelings for their ex. The friend was involved in an incident where the ex damaged his car, then a year later he reached out to get it fixed, leading to a relationship. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's feelings towards the ex, the friend's actions in pursuing a relationship with the ex after the breakup, and the author's reaction to that. \n\nThe author is upset because the friend is dating their ex. They mention that they still have feelings, which the friend knows about. The friend's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since the ex had previously been in a relationship with the author. \n\nBut is the author wrong for being upset? Well, people have different emotional responses. If the author hasn't moved on, it's natural to feel hurt. The fact that the friend knew about the author's feelings makes it more complicated. The friend's decision to date the ex after knowing could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is allowed to date whomever she chooses after a breakup. The friend isn't necessarily at fault for moving on. However, the friend's timing and the fact that he was involved in the incident with the car might add to the author's frustration. \n\nThe author choosing to distance themselves is a personal choice. They aren't doing anything wrong by taking a step back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. Since the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still pursued a relationship, the author's upset reaction is justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
