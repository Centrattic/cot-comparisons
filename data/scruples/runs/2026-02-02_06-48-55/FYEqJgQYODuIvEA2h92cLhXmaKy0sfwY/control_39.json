I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago. The ex left their place, damaged a friend's car, and then a year later the friend contacted her to fix the bumper. They started hanging out and now they're dating. The author is cutting contact with the friend because they're upset.\n\nHmm, so first, the author still has feelings for the ex. That's important. The friend knew that the author had feelings, yet still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is cutting off the friend as a result. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Well, people have different boundaries. If the friend knew the author had feelings and still went ahead, maybe the friend is in the wrong. But the author is reacting emotionally. Is cutting off a friend because of their relationship choices wrong? It's a personal decision. The friend might have done something insensitive, but the author's reaction is to distance themselves. \n\nSome might say that the author is overreacting because it's been a year, but others might support their right to set boundaries. The key point is the friend's knowledge of the author's feelings. If the friend respected the author's feelings, he might not have pursued the ex. But since he did, the author has a right to be upset. \n\nSo is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're protecting their feelings. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
