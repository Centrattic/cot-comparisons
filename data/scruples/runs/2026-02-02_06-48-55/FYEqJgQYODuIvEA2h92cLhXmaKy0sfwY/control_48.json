I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car, then the friend contacted her to fix it, they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is cutting off their friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a relationship with the ex, which ended a year ago. The friend was present when the ex moved out, and there was some car damage. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about fixing the bumper, then they started hanging out and now dating. The author is upset and is distancing themselves from the friend. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the time frame. A year has passed since the breakup. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is clear. The friend knew about these feelings but chose to date the ex. The author is cutting off the friend, which might seem harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe friend's actions: contacting the ex a year later to fix the bumper, then starting a relationship. The author might feel betrayed or hurt that the friend didn't respect their feelings. The friend knew the author still had feelings, so maybe there's some responsibility there. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is free to move on, and the friend is allowed to date someone they're attracted to. However, the friend might not have considered the author's feelings in this situation. The author's reaction is to take a step back, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their reaction is reasonable. They have the right to take space if they're uncomfortable. The friend might have overstepped by not considering the author's feelings, so the author's response isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
