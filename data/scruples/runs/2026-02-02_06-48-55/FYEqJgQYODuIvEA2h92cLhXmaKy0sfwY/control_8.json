I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left their place and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off their friend.\n\nFirst, the author has feelings for the ex, which might still be valid. They had support from the friend when the ex left, so there's a history of friendship. The friend waited a year to get in touch, which could be seen as giving time to heal. The friend informed the author, which is considerate. The author's response is to step back from friendship but still wishes them luck. \n\nThe key points here are emotional boundaries and respect. The author's feelings are valid, and it's okay to distance oneself if it's hurtful. The friend's actions might be insensitive, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being. The question is whether the author overreacted. Since the friend approached the ex after a year and informed the author, maybe the author's reaction is justified. The friend might have known about the lingering feelings, so approaching the ex could be a breach. The author isn't at fault for wanting space. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
