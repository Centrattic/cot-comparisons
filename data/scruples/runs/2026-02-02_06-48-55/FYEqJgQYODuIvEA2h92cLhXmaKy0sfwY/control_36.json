A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out again. Now the friend is going on a date with the ex, and the author is upset, cutting ties with the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the timeline and intentions. The author and ex broke up a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend didn't start dating the ex immediately after the breakup, so maybe the author had some time to move on. However, the author still has feelings for the ex, which complicates things. The friend waited a year to reach out to the ex, which might mean he wasn't just immediately jumping in, but there's still that incident with the car. \n\nThe friend informed the author about the date, which is respectful. The author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. The author might feel betrayed because the friend was there for them during the breakup, and now the friend is moving on with the ex. But the friend didn't act right away; he waited a year. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author has the right to feel hurt, especially if they still have feelings. However, the ex is free to date someone else after a year, and the friend might have moved on too. The author cutting ties might be a personal choice, but it's not necessarily wrong. However, the friend might have a point if they thought enough time had passed. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe friend did inform the author, which is considerate. The author's decision to distance themselves is their choice, but does that make them the asshole? Maybe not. People have different healing times. The author might need space to process this. The friend might have overstepped if they knew the author still had feelings, but if they weren't aware, then maybe the author's reaction is too harsh. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have the right to be upset and take a step back. The friend's actions, while maybe a bit insensitive, aren't necessarily wrong either. It's a situation where both parties have valid feelings.\n"
