I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend dating the author's ex after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was some incident with damaging a car bumper. Then, a year later, the friend (the buddy who had the damaged bumper) contacts the ex to fix it. They start hanging out and eventually go on a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend because they still have feelings for the ex.\n\nThe author is upset and cutting off their friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author is still emotional about the breakup. Their ex moved on quickly, and the friend is now dating her. The author feels hurt and is reacting by cutting off the friend. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the friend did wait a year to contact the ex, which might be after the breakup period. The author's friend might not have known about the author's feelings, but the author mentions they still have feelings. However, the friend is now dating the ex, which could be seen as moving on, but the author feels betrayed because the friend was their buddy.\n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves. The question is whether that makes them the asshole. Well, the author has a right to feel hurt. But does cutting off a friend over this make them wrong?\n\nIn some contexts, people might say that the friend crossed a line by dating the ex, especially if the author had mentioned still having feelings. But if the author didn't explicitly tell the friend not to contact the ex, then the friend might not have known. However, the author did mention that they still have feelings, so the friend should have been aware. \n\nBut is it the friend's fault for moving on? The author's ex is now dating someone else, which is a natural part of life. The author's reaction might be about their own unresolved feelings rather than the friend's actions. \n\nThe author is choosing to cut off a friend because of this. That's a personal choice, but does that make them the asshole? It depends on the context. If the author hasn't given closure or if the friend acted in bad faith, maybe not. But if the friend acted in good faith, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people are expected to move on after a certain time. A year is a significant period. The author might be projecting their feelings onto the friend. The friend's actions might not be malicious. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction is understandable, but cutting off a friend because of this might be seen as extreme. However, the author isn't wrong to feel upset, but maybe their reaction is not entirely their fault. It's a bit of a gray area. But in the context of the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to be upset. But maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because cutting off a friend over someone else's dating life could be seen as extreme unless there's a clear betrayal. Wait, the friend did contact the ex after a year, which might be after the author's \"cooling off\" period. The author's friend might not have known about the author's lingering feelings if they weren't communicated. So the friend might have acted in good faith. Therefore, the author's reaction is harsh. So, maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check similar AITA cases. Often, if someone is dating an ex, it's not seen as the person's fault unless there's some malice. The author is upset, but cutting off a friend might be seen as their own issue. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
