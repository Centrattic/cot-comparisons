I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the timeline: the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, the ex accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and then they start hanging out and eventually go on a date. The author finds out through the friend, who told them. The author then distances themselves from the friend, saying they respect the friend for telling them but can't be friends anymore.\n\nNow, the author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The key points here are the author's feelings towards the ex (they still have feelings), the friend's actions, and the author's response.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, people have the right to feel upset when someone they care about is involved with their ex, especially if they're not over the breakup. The author's decision to distance themselves isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. However, maybe there's a nuance here. The friend did reach out to inform the author, which could be seen as respectful. The author's response was to cut off the friendship, which might be a bit harsh, but if the author is still emotionally involved, they might need that space.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have a right to move on and date someone else, even if it's the author's ex. Also, the ex damaged the friend's car, which might add to the situation, but that's a separate issue. The main conflict is the friend dating the ex. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction is justified. If the author isn't over their ex, it's reasonable to be upset. The friend might have considered the author's feelings by informing them, but the author is still within their rights to distance themselves. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that holding onto feelings a year later is unreasonable, but that's subjective. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have communicated their feelings to the friend instead of just cutting off. But the author did say they were taking a step back, which is a form of boundary setting. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to check if there's anything else. The ex's actions (hitting the car) might have contributed to the tension. However, the main point is the friendship and dating. The friend might have done the right thing by informing the author, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and setting boundaries. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
