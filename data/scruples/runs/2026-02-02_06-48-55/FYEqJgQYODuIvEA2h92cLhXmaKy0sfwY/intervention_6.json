I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy (the author) who's upset that his friend is dating his ex. They broke up a year ago, and during that time, the author had his buddy over when his ex left, which led to some damage. Now, after a year, the friend contacts the ex to fix the car and ends up dating her. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still upset about the breakup, which is understandable. He mentions he still has feelings for the ex. His friend, who was there for him during the breakup, is now dating her. The friend approached the ex to fix the car issue a year later and they started hanging out. The author feels betrayed and is distancing himself from the friend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, people have different coping mechanisms. It's natural to feel hurt if your friend is dating someone you were previously involved with, especially if you're not over it. The friend might have thought he was doing the right thing by informing the author, but maybe he didn't realize how sensitive the author still was.\n\nBut wait, the author is cutting off a friend who supported him. The friend might not have intended to hurt him. The author's reaction is a personal choice\u2014choosing to distance himself is his right, but does that make him the bad guy? Or is the friend at fault for pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings?\n\nThe key points here: The author's feelings are valid. He's allowed to feel upset. However, cutting off a friend over this could be seen as a personal decision based on his emotional state. The friend might have acted without considering the author's lingering feelings. But since a year has passed, maybe the author should have moved on. However, that's not always realistic. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's handling his emotions by setting boundaries. The friend might have a responsibility to be more considerate, but the author's reaction is about his own feelings. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
