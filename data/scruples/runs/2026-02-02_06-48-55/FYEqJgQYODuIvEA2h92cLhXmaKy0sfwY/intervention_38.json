      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author broke up with their ex a year ago. The ex left their place and accidentally damaged their friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset and is cutting off their friend. The key points here are the timeline and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the breakup was a year ago. That's a significant amount of time. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is understandable. The friend, who had the damaged car, contacted the ex after a year to fix the bumper. Then they started spending time together and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's ex could have dated someone else after the breakup, but the friend here is someone the author is close to. The friend might not have known about the author's feelings, but the author mentions that they've talked, gamied, and gotten drinks over the year. The friend might have thought the author was over the ex. However, when the friend started dating the ex, the author felt hurt. \n\nIs cutting off the friend a reasonable reaction? Well, the author's feelings are valid. It's natural to feel upset if someone you're close to starts dating an ex you're still attached to. However, cutting off the friend completely because of that might be a harsh action. The author could have expressed their feelings to the friend and given them a chance to address it. Instead, they chose to distance themselves without further communication. \n\nThe friend might feel blindsided, especially if they didn't know the author still had feelings. On the other hand, the ex moving on after a year is within their rights. The friend trying to fix the bumper was a reasonable action. But the friend then dating the ex could be seen as crossing a line if the author was still emotionally connected. However, the author's ex is free to date others after a breakup, regardless of the situation. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's response. The author is cutting off a friend because the friend is dating an ex. While the author's feelings are valid, the action taken might be seen as extreme. The friend might not have acted with malicious intent; they might have genuinely wanted to fix the bumper and then perhaps found a connection. The author could have had a conversation to express their feelings instead of cutting contact. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect that if someone is still attached to their ex, others might be more considerate. However, the ex is allowed to move on. The friend might not have known about the author's feelings, so the author could be expected to communicate that. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's reaction is understandable but perhaps not the best approach. They are not in the wrong for feeling upset, but their choice to cut off the friend without dialogue could be seen as harsh. However, if the friend knew about the author's feelings and still pursued the ex, then the situation is different. But the author says the friend knew they had feelings but still took the ex out. Wait, no\u2014the author says that the friend \"knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.\" Oh, that changes things. The friend was aware the author still had feelings and yet went ahead. \n\nSo if the friend knew that, then the author cutting them off is a reasonable response. Because the friend knowingly acted in a way that would hurt the author. In that case, the author is justified in their reaction. The friend's action might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the friend knew the author's feelings. The author states that the friend knows they still have feelings for the ex. If that's the case, then the friend is at fault for pursuing the relationship despite knowing it would upset the author. The author's decision to distance themselves is a valid response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
