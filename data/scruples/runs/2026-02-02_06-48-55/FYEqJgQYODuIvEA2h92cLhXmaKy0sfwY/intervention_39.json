I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline. They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she accidentally damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year before contacting her about fixing it. Then they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author finds out and distances themselves from the friend.\n\nThe author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they had a one-year break. The friend knows the author still has feelings for the ex. The author's action is cutting off the friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's actions. Did the friend do something wrong? The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the car damage. The author and friend had remained in contact all year. The friend knew the author still had feelings but went ahead and dated the ex. Is the friend at fault here? The author is reacting by distancing, but is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have thought that since it's been a year, it's okay to pursue the ex. Also, the car damage was an accident, so maybe the friend was just being responsible. But the friend knew the author's feelings, so maybe they should have considered that. The author's feelings are hurt, but does that make the friend wrong?\n\nAlternatively, the author might feel betrayed that their friend is dating their ex, especially knowing their feelings. But the author's reaction is to cut off the friend. Is that a reasonable response? Maybe the author should have communicated their feelings instead of just distancing. But is the author in the wrong for feeling that way?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. If the friend acted in a way that was respectful and clear, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the friend knew the author's feelings and still pursued the ex, maybe the friend is in the wrong, making the author's reaction justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends shouldn't date exes if they know it would hurt their friend. So the friend may have made a mistake. However, the author cutting off the friend immediately without discussion might be harsh, but maybe not entirely wrong. The author has the right to feel upset. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong here. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive, so the author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
