We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who changed his daughter's schedule with his ex to have more time with her, which upset his new girlfriend. The ex had been given 50/50 custody, but he changed it to have her more days. The girlfriend took it as a rejection, and he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. He's the primary caregiver, and he's concerned about his daughter being with babysitters. He changed the schedule to spend more time with her. That seems like a reasonable decision for a parent, especially if he's worried about her well-being. The ex agreed to the new schedule, so maybe that part is okay.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction. She felt he prioritized the kid over the relationship. But he's a parent, and children often come first. The girlfriend might not have anticipated that he would put his daughter's needs above their relationship. However, ending the relationship over this might be extreme. But maybe she wasn't prepared for the commitment required when dating a single parent.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The main points are: Did he have a valid reason to change the schedule? Yes, he was concerned about his daughter's time with babysitters. Did he communicate well with the girlfriend? He mentioned he involved her when he had time with the daughter, but she still felt excluded. He tried to suggest family could help, which might not have been enough. The girlfriend's reaction was immediate and severe, ending the relationship. \n\nFrom a parent's standpoint, ensuring the child's well-being is crucial. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical regarding custody. The girlfriend might need to understand the importance of his role as a parent. But maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, explaining why the change was necessary and how he could still make time for the relationship. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems overly harsh. Ending the relationship over a scheduling change, even if it affects weekends, might be disproportionate. \n\nBut the author is a parent, and his child's needs are primary. If the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe she wasn't the right person. The author standing his ground could be justified. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
