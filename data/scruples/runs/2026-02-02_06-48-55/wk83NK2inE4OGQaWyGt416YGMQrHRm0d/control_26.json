We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dad who's been in a relationship for about six months. His daughter is 3, and he has custody, but the ex has been getting 50/50 time. The ex started a business, so the daughter ends up with sitters a lot when she's with her mom. The dad wants to adjust the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, so the ex can't use sitters as much. The new girlfriend is upset because the dad's schedule change might take away their weekends, and she broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's perspective. He's the sole provider and has been the main emotional support. The ex has issues, and he's trying to ensure his daughter has a stable parent. Changing the schedule seems like he's trying to protect her from being left with sitters. The ex agreed to the new schedule, so he's acting in the child's best interest.\n\nNow the girlfriend's reaction. She's been involved with the dad and his daughter, but when he changes the schedule, she feels devalued. She says if he does this, their relationship is over. The dad's response is that his daughter comes first. The question is, is it wrong for him to prioritize his daughter over a six-month relationship?\n\nLegally, custody arrangements can be adjusted if it's in the child's best interest. Since the ex agreed, the dad's change is valid. Emotionally, the dad is doing his best for his daughter. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid if she felt neglected, but the dad is clear that his family comes first. The relationship is new, and he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his child. However, maybe he could have communicated better with the girlfriend, but given the circumstances, he's not the asshole.\n"
