We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their daughter's schedule and how the new girlfriend reacted.\n\nFirst, the author has custody of their 3-year-old daughter because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues. The ex is now trying to have more time with the child, and they've been on a shared schedule. The author then starts a new relationship. The ex is working a business that requires the child to be with sitters, which the author doesn't like because they want the daughter to spend more time with them. They change the schedule so the author has the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, which helps the child not be with sitters. The girlfriend hears about this and reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and threatens to end the relationship if the schedule change happens.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the child's well-being is their priority, and they've always put the child first. The girlfriend is upset that the author's family (parents) can help, but she's not the first priority. The author stands by the decision, thinking the girlfriend shouldn't have a say in the child's schedule.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author is the custodial parent, making decisions in the child's best interest. The ex's ability to care for the child is questionable due to past issues. The author is trying to limit the child's time with sitters, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction seems to prioritize her own time over the child's needs, which isn't appropriate. The author isn't required to put the girlfriend's needs above the child's. The girlfriend's ultimatum is unreasonable given the circumstances. The author is not in the wrong for making decisions that prioritize their child's well-being, even if it affects their new relationship. The answer is B.\n"
