We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dad changing his daughter's custody schedule, and his new girlfriend is upset because she thinks she's being pushed aside.\n\nFirst, the dad has full custody, but the ex has been getting 50/50 time. The ex is working, so the kid is with sitters a lot. The dad is worried about the quality time the ex is spending with the daughter. They agreed on a new schedule where the dad has the weekends, which makes it less likely the kid is with a sitter during the week. The dad has a new girlfriend who's been involved with the kid, but when he tells her about the schedule change, she reacts strongly, saying it's the end of their relationship if he does it.\n\nThe question is whether the dad is wrong. Let's break it down. The dad's main priority is his daughter's well-being. He's been the sole provider and emotional support since the divorce. The ex's issues with substance abuse and infidelity led to the custody situation. Now, the ex is trying to have more time, but the dad is concerned about her not being present enough. So, adjusting the schedule to ensure his daughter has consistent time with him seems reasonable from a parental responsibility standpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset that her weekends are affected. She's been involved with the kid, which is good, but the dad is prioritizing his child over their relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially since the dad explains that his family can help if needed. His response about family stepping in shows he's trying to balance both his relationship and his parenting duties. The girlfriend's immediate reaction to end the relationship because of the schedule change suggests she might not be handling the situation well. The dad isn't neglecting the girlfriend; he's making sure his daughter is taken care of, which is his primary responsibility as a parent.\n\nAlso, the dad didn't force the schedule change without consulting her. They had a discussion about it. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling replaced rather than the dad actually being inconsiderate. Since the dad is acting in his daughter's best interest and has made efforts to include the girlfriend in their lives, he's probably in the right. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations regarding the new relationship dynamics.\n"
