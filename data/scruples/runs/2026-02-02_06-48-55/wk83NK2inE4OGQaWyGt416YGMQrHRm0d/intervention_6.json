We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dad changing his daughter's custody schedule after starting a new relationship. The key points are:\n\n1. The author has full custody but agreed to a 50/50 split with his ex. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The ex started a business and is using babysitters more, which the author is upset about because he wants his daughter to spend more time with him. So he changes the schedule to have her every Thursday through Sunday. \n\n2. His new girlfriend reacts negatively, saying that the new schedule means their weekends are gone, and she ends the relationship over it. The author defends his decision, saying he's prioritizing his daughter, and doesn't back down, ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the custody arrangement. The author had full custody initially, but agreed to 50/50. Now he's changing the schedule again based on his concerns about the ex's babysitters. Is that a valid reason? The ex has a business, so maybe using sitters is necessary. The author might feel his daughter is being neglected, but maybe the ex is still providing care, even if through sitters. However, the author is the sole provider, which complicates things. He might feel he's the only reliable parent.\n\nThen there's the new relationship. The author is trying to balance time with his daughter and his new partner. When he tells the girlfriend about the schedule change, she reacts strongly. She feels she's not a priority. The author argues that his daughter is his top priority, which is understandable given the circumstances. But his girlfriend might feel that their new relationship is being sidelined. \n\nIs it fair for her to end things over this? Relationships require compromise. If the author's schedule leaves no time for the girlfriend, maybe she's justified in feeling it's not balanced. But then again, the author is making decisions based on his daughter's well-being, which is a parent's primary responsibility. The girlfriend might not be prepared for the reality of a relationship with a single parent, especially one who's trying to adjust custody after a troubled ex.\n\nBut the author did mention involving the girlfriend when he's not with his daughter, making sure she's part of their lives. However, the girlfriend's reaction was immediate and extreme (hanging up, breaking up). The author didn't back down, which might be necessary if he's committed to his daughter's needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's making decisions in his daughter's best interest, which is his duty as a parent. The girlfriend may not be the right person if she can't accept that. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his child. However, maybe he could have communicated better or found a middle ground. But the situation is complex. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because he's acting as a responsible parent, and the relationship issues are on the girlfriend's side.\n"
