We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's trying to adjust his daughter's schedule with his ex-wife, and his new girlfriend is upset about it. The main question is whether he's wrong for changing the schedule based on his concerns about his daughter's well-being.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The daughter is 3 years old, and the father has custody since the mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. The ex started a business and was using babysitters, which the father found problematic. So they agreed on a new schedule where the father gets the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, which are his weekends off. The new girlfriend, when informed, reacts negatively, saying that this means their weekends are gone. The father explains that his family is available to help, but the girlfriend ends the relationship over it.\n\nThe father's reasoning is that his daughter's well-being is his top priority, and he's trying to ensure she's not left with random sitters. The girlfriend, however, feels like she's not the priority in the relationship. The father stands by his decision, thinking he's doing the right thing for his child.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The father is a parent, and his primary responsibility is to his child. The ex had given up custody voluntarily, so he's doing what he believes is best for her. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her own needs versus his parental duties. But is there a point where the girlfriend's feelings are valid? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to feel valued, but when it comes to a child, especially in this context, the parent's duty might take precedence.\n\nThe father didn't force the schedule change without the ex's agreement; they discussed it and agreed. So he's not acting unilaterally against the ex. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be out of proportion if the father is genuinely trying to act in his daughter's best interest. However, the father could have considered how to communicate this change to his girlfriend in a way that reassures her without making her feel like she's being sidelined. But the core issue is about parental responsibility versus a romantic relationship's expectations.\n\nIs the father wrong for prioritizing his daughter's time with him over the girlfriend's desire for weekend plans? Probably not. The girlfriend should understand that a parent's role is primary. The father isn't doing this to spite her but to ensure his daughter's time is not spent with unreliable sitters. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she's not ready for the reality of dating a single parent with custody. In that case, the father isn't wrong for standing his ground, even if it ends the relationship. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
