We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has a 3-year-old daughter. The mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to the author getting full custody, though the mother voluntarily gave it up. Now, the mother has improved and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for 6 months. The author is in a new relationship, which the family likes. \n\nRecently, the ex-mother started a mobile spray tanning business, so the daughter is often with babysitters. The author is concerned about the daughter's well-being and wants to adjust the schedule to have her more on weekends, making it less likely for the daughter to be with sitters during the week. They agreed to a new schedule where the author has the daughter Thursday to Sunday.\n\nThe new girlfriend reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends,\" and when the author suggests family can help, she hangs up and later threatens to end the relationship if the schedule is kept. The author stands by the decision, prioritizing the daughter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's responsibility to their child versus the new relationship. The author is the sole provider and has custody. The new girlfriend seems to be upset about losing weekend time with the author. However, the author's main concern is the daughter's well-being, especially since the ex-mother's work leads to sitters. The author is trying to ensure the daughter is with a parent more.\n\nIn terms of legal custody, the author has custody, so adjusting the schedule to maximize time with the daughter when the other parent's time is inconsistent makes sense. The new girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her own time, not the child's best interest. The author is prioritizing the child, which is expected in a parent's role. The girlfriend's ultimatum about the relationship seems to be a personal issue, not a parental duty. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they are fulfilling their parental responsibilities. The girlfriend needs to accept that the child comes first. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
