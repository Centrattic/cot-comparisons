We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The story is about a parent whose ex has custody issues but now wants 50/50 time with their daughter. The author is the one with full custody and decided to adjust the schedule to have more time with the daughter. Then his girlfriend reacts negatively, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibilities. The ex has substance abuse and infidelity history, leading to the author having custody. The ex is now trying to get more time, but maybe not effectively, as the daughter is with sitters. The author wants to ensure the daughter's time isn't with random sitters. So changing the schedule to spend more time with her seems like a responsible move, especially since the author has been the main provider.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset because weekends are taken by the daughter and family. She feels de-prioritized. The author explains that family is important and that his family can help if needed. The girlfriend's reaction is to end the relationship, which seems extreme, but maybe she feels neglected. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main responsibility is his child. The relationship is only six months old, and the author is prioritizing parental duties. The girlfriend might not have considered the long-term commitment of parenting versus a romantic relationship. However, the author's approach to communication might have been abrupt. Telling the girlfriend the schedule changed without considering her feelings might have been insensitive. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the parent's primary role is to the child. The girlfriend might need to be aware that this is a significant aspect of the author's life. The author didn't promise to prioritize the girlfriend over the child. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own expectations not aligning with the realities of the author's parenting responsibilities. \n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author has a duty to his child, and the girlfriend's inability to accept that might be her issue, not his.\n"
