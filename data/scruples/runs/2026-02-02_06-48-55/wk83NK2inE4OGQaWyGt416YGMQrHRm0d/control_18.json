We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. The main issue is about changing the daughter's schedule and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent who has full custody due to the ex's past issues. They've been working on a 2-2-3 schedule for 6 months, and the ex is trying to be a better parent. Now, the author is in a new relationship and the girlfriend is upset when they changed the schedule. The new proposed schedule gives the author more time with the daughter on weekends, which the girlfriend interprets as the author prioritizing the daughter over her, leading to her threatening to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's responsibility as a parent versus the girlfriend's expectations in the relationship. The author argues that the child comes first, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she's not a priority. \n\nFrom a parental responsibility perspective, putting the child's well-being first is standard. The author's actions are aimed at ensuring the child is with a parent, not a babysitter. The ex's new business might be causing the child to be with sitters more, so the author is adjusting to counteract that. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be a conflict between her needs as a partner and the parent's responsibilities. The author might be justified in prioritizing the child, especially given the history. However, the way the author handles the communication could be a point of critique. The girlfriend felt the change was abrupt and not considered, leading to her feeling devalued. \n\nBut the author was clear about the reasons and had involved the girlfriend in activities with the daughter. The girlfriend's immediate reaction of ending the relationship might be seen as extreme, but it's also her emotional response to feeling neglected. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the balance between parental duties and relationship commitments. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing the child's needs. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic given the parent's role. However, the author could have considered the girlfriend's feelings more, but the core issue is about the child's welfare. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The parent's responsibility to their child takes precedence over the new relationship's dynamics.\n"
