We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a single parent with a 3-year-old daughter. The ex-mother had substance abuse issues and infidelity, leading to full custody. They transitioned to a 50/50 schedule recently. The author is now in a new relationship and the ex has a mobile tanning business, so the daughter is often with sitters when with the mother. The author is concerned about the child's well-being and wants to adjust the schedule to have her on weekends when the ex is working. The new girlfriend gets upset, saying this will take away their weekends and ends the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is prioritizing the child's needs. The ex's situation with sitters is a valid concern, especially since the author has been the primary caregiver. The schedule change is to ensure the child is with a parent more, which seems responsible. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her own inconvenience and not the child's best interest. The author explains that family can help, which shows they're not abandoning the girlfriend but still prioritizing the daughter. \n\nThe key points are the child's welfare, the history of the ex's issues, and the girlfriend's lack of understanding. The author isn't wrong for putting their daughter first. The girlfriend might not realize the importance of the child's stability. The author is in a difficult position balancing parenting and a new relationship. The girlfriend's ultimatum is unreasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
