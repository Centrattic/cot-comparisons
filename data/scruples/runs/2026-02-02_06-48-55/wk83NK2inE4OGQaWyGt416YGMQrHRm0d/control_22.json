We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a father adjusting his daughter's custody schedule, which has led to a conflict with his new girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The father has custody, and the ex is now getting more time. They switched to a 2-2-3 schedule. He's been the sole provider and emotional support. The ex now has a business and the daughter is with sitters more, which he's upset about. They changed the schedule so the daughter is with him Thursday to Sunday. \n\nHe's in a new relationship, and his girlfriend reacted negatively, saying the new schedule would take away their weekends. He tried to explain that family can help, but she hung up and threatened to end the relationship if he goes ahead with the schedule.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The author thinks he's right for prioritizing his daughter, but the girlfriend is upset about losing time with him. \n\nI need to consider the parent's responsibility. The father's main duty is to his child's well-being. The ex's situation with the sitters is a valid concern, so adjusting the schedule to ensure the daughter is with him more makes sense. The girlfriend is a new partner, and while relationships require balance, the father's commitment to his child is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme since the relationship is only six months old. He's not dismissing her, but he's standing by his decision. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did he involve her in the decision-making? He mentions she's aware of his efforts, but when he announced the change, her reaction was immediate. He might have handled the communication better, but the core issue is about the child's needs. The girlfriend's prioritization here could indicate future problems. \n\nAlternatively, is he wrong for not compromising more with the girlfriend? However, the father's situation is that the child's well-being is his top priority. The girlfriend might need to adjust or realize that a parent's responsibilities come first. \n\nSo, considering all that, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
