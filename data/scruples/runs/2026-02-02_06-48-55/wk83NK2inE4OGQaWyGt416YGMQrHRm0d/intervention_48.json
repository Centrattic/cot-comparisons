We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis of the situation where the parent changed their daughter's schedule, leading to the girlfriend ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has full custody of their 3-year-old daughter because the ex has substance abuse and infidelity issues. They had a 2-2-3 schedule for 6 months, then the ex started a tanning business, so the author changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday. The girlfriend, who the author is in a 6-month relationship with, got upset that their weekends are now taken by the daughter and the family, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe author's side: They're prioritizing their daughter's well-being, especially since the ex isn't the ideal parent. They mention that the ex's new business leads to the daughter being with babysitters, which the author finds unacceptable. The author is trying to ensure the daughter has a stable, loving relationship with them and family. They also mention that they involve the girlfriend in their time with the daughter when possible. When the girlfriend reacted negatively, the author stood their ground, thinking the daughter comes first.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: She might feel neglected because the author's family is always involved, and the new schedule takes away their weekends. She might feel like the author isn't prioritizing the relationship enough, even if the author is doing what they think is right for their child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the child's needs vs. the relationship. The author has a history of being the primary caregiver, the ex's issues, and the new schedule is to prevent the daughter from being with babysitters. The author's justification is that the child comes first, which is a common and valid stance for a parent. The girlfriend might not have expected this level of commitment, but it's the author's responsibility to their child.\n\nHowever, communication could be a factor. The author mentions they involve the girlfriend in their time with the daughter when possible. The girlfriend's reaction seems impulsive (hanging up) and ultimatums might indicate her own expectations weren't communicated clearly. The author might not have considered that a 6-month relationship might have different expectations, but they are not in the wrong for prioritizing their child's needs over a new relationship. The author's actions are in the child's best interest, which is a strong argument against them being in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from not being prepared for the demands of a relationship with a single parent. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
