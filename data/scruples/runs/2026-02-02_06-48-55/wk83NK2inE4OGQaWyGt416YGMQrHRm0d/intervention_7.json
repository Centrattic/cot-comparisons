We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent changing their child's custody schedule and how their new partner reacted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The father has full custody but agreed to a 50/50 arrangement with the mother, who has a history of substance abuse and infidelity. The mother is now working and has a new business, leading to the daughter being with sitters often. The father wants to adjust the schedule to have more time with the daughter, which he sees as better for her. He communicates this to his new girlfriend, who reacts negatively, saying it's the end of their relationship because he's not prioritizing her.\n\nThe author's argument is that the child's well-being is his top priority, and the girlfriend should understand that. The girlfriend, however, feels replaced or not as important. The key question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his daughter over the girlfriend.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father does have primary custody, so his focus on the child's needs is justified. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel insecure or neglected, but the father's responsibility lies with his daughter. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's also about differing priorities. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's acting in his child's best interest, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's expectations about his availability might be unreasonable given his primary role as a single parent. However, communication could have been better. But the core issue is the conflict between parental duties and a new relationship, which is tricky. The author's choice to prioritize the daughter isn't wrong, even if the girlfriend doesn't like it. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
