We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody schedule and the new romantic partner reacting negatively.\n\nThe author has full custody of their 3-year-old daughter, but the ex had been getting 50/50 time and they were on a 2-2-3 schedule. The ex now runs a mobile spray tanning business, so the daughter is with sitters more. The author proposed a new schedule where they have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, which is the author's weekends. The new partner, upon being told, said \"Well there goes our weekends!\" and then threatened to end the relationship if the schedule is kept.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for changing the schedule. The user wants a simple A or B answer. \n\nFirst, the author has custody, so they have the legal right to make decisions about the child's schedule. The ex's ability to care for the child is questionable due to past substance abuse and infidelity, which led to the author having full custody. The author is concerned about the child being with babysitters and wants more time with her, especially since family is available. The partner's reaction seems to be about the author's time with the family versus her, but the author's priority is the child's well-being. \n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility as a parent versus the partner's personal feelings about the schedule. The partner's statement implies that the author is prioritizing the child over her, but the author is in a situation where they have custody and a history of the ex's issues. The author is trying to ensure the child is with a responsible caregiver (family) instead of babysitters, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe partner might feel neglected, but the author is prioritizing their child's needs, which is a common and understandable stance. Since the author has custody, they can adjust the schedule as needed, especially if it's for the child's best interest. The ex's business might not provide consistent care, so the author's move to secure the child's time with family is reasonable. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems immature and not considering the child's welfare. The author is not in the wrong for making the child's well-being the priority. So the answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
