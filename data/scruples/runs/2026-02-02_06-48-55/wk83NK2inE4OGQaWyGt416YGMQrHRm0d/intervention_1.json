We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody arrangement and a new relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has full custody of their daughter, but agreed to a 50/50 schedule with the ex. The ex has substance abuse issues and infidelity, leading to the divorce. The ex started improving and requested 50/50 time, which the author agreed to. Now, the ex runs a business and the child is with sitters when with her. The author is bothered by this and wants to adjust the schedule to keep the daughter with him more, especially over the weekends. \n\nThe author is in a new relationship. The girlfriend hears about the schedule change and reacts strongly, leading to a breakup. The author thinks he's right because the child comes first, and the relationship shouldn't interfere. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the key points: The author's priority is his daughter's well-being. The ex's situation with the business leads to less quality time, so adjusting the schedule makes sense. The author made sure the girlfriend was involved when possible. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, seeing the schedule change as a priority issue. The author stood by his decision, which is about parental responsibility.\n\nBut is he wrong? The author isn't being selfish; he's making a decision based on his child's needs. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here. The author isn't neglecting the relationship; he's balancing his responsibilities as a parent. The ex's history and current situation support the need for the schedule change. The author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
