We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. I need to read through the scenario carefully and analyze the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has a 3-year-old daughter. The mother, due to substance abuse and infidelity, voluntarily gave up custody, so the author has full custody. They were on a 2-2-3 schedule for 50/50 time with the ex, which has been in place for six months. Now, the author is in a new relationship. The ex, who runs a business, has been leaving the daughter with babysitters. The author is concerned about the daughter's well-being and the quality of time she's getting with her mother. So, they agreed to change the schedule to 4 days a week (Thursday to Sunday) to ensure more time with the author and minimize daycare/sitters.\n\nThen, the author's new partner reacted negatively when told about the schedule change. She felt it was a priority shift and ended the relationship. The author is now seeking validation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to change the schedule. Let's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Legal Custody**: The author has full custody, so they have the legal right to make decisions regarding the child's schedule. The ex agreed to 50/50 time, but the author is adjusting the schedule again. However, custody arrangements can be modified with mutual agreement, so if the ex agreed to the change, that's valid.\n\n2. **Child's Best Interest**: The author is concerned about the daughter being with sitters. Given the ex's history with substance abuse and the current situation with the business, prioritizing the child's stability and emotional well-being is important. At 3 years old, consistent and quality time with a parent is crucial.\n\n3. **New Relationship**: The partner felt the schedule change prioritized the child over her. The author mentions that family is available to help, so the new schedule isn't cutting off all time with the partner. The author also states that they involve the partner in activities when they don't have the child. The partner's reaction seems extreme, ending the relationship over this.\n\n4. **Communication**: The author explains the situation to the partner and anticipates her involvement with the child. The partner's immediate reaction was negative, leading to the breakup. The author tried to reassure by mentioning family support but it didn't help.\n\n5. **History with Ex**: The ex's past issues and current situation (business requiring sitters) might justify the author's desire to have more direct care. The author's priority in parenting seems valid.\n\nIs the author wrong? The decision to change the schedule to ensure the child's well-being isn't inherently wrong. The ex's agreement makes the change legal and agreed upon. The author's commitment to the child's needs over a new relationship is understandable, especially given the child's history. The partner's reaction seems to stem from feeling devalued, but the author's actions are in the child's best interest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
