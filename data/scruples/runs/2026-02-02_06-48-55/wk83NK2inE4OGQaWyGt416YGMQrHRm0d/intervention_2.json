We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their 3-year-old daughter, a divorce from the mother who had substance abuse and infidelity, leading to the father having full custody. Now, the mother is trying to have 50/50 time, but the dad is concerned because she's using a babysitter from her spray tanning business. The dad changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, and his new girlfriend is upset because she thinks he's prioritizing the kid over the relationship.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the child's well-being is his top priority, especially since he's been the sole provider and emotional support. He's trying to ensure the daughter is with a parent (either him or his ex) instead of sitters. The girlfriend is upset and threatens to leave, and he ends the relationship because he can't compromise on the child's needs.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the father has primary custody and has custody because the mother had issues. Now she's trying to improve, but he's worried about her using sitters. He adjusted the schedule to have more time with the daughter. The girlfriend's reaction is that this takes away their weekends. But the father's argument is that the child's needs come first, and he's ensuring her time is with parents or family, not strangers. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she feels devalued, but the father can't control his ex's parenting. However, he did involve her in his daughter's life when he's not with her. The father's decision to prioritize his daughter over the girlfriend might be seen as right, especially given the history. The girlfriend might not have considered the parent's responsibilities first. \n\nOn the other hand, the father could have tried to find a middle ground, but the situation is about his non-negotiable for his child. Since he's the custodial parent, his actions are in the child's best interest. The girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the father's role. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's prioritizing his child's well-being, which is his responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems to not take into account the father's parental duties. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
