We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their daughter's schedule. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has full custody of their 3-year-old daughter because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues. The ex is now trying to have 50/50 time, and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The author is in a new relationship, and the girlfriend (GF) is very involved with the daughter when the author doesn't have custody. The author decided to change the schedule so they can have the daughter on weekends, which are their days off. The GF reacted badly, saying it ends their relationship if the schedule changes. The author stood their ground, saying the child comes first.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. The author's primary responsibility is their daughter's well-being. The ex has a history of issues, and the author is the main provider. The GF is a new partner, and while she's been supportive, the author's commitment to the child seems strong. The GF's reaction seems to be about her own feelings of not being the top priority. The author's decision to prioritize their child over the new relationship might be justified, especially considering the child's needs. The GF knew about the child from the start, so maybe she should have considered that. However, the author might have considered the GF's feelings more, but the child's welfare is paramount. So probably, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B."
