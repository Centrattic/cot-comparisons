We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody schedule change and a new relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has full custody but agreed to a 50/50 schedule with the ex. Now, they're changing the schedule again because the ex's new business leads to the daughter being with babysitters. The author's main concern is that the daughter isn't getting enough quality time with a parent, which is understandable. They mention being the sole provider and emotionally supportive since the daughter was a baby. The ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues, which led to the original custody arrangement.\n\nThe new girlfriend reacts negatively, saying the schedule change is a problem because it affects their weekend plans. The author explains that other family members can help, but the girlfriend ends the conversation, leading to a breakup. The author stands by their decision, prioritizing the daughter's well-being over the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author's motivation is to ensure the daughter has more time with a parent, especially since the ex's new job setup might mean the daughter is with sitters. The author isn't trying to sabotage the ex but to improve the daughter's care. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about her own inconvenience rather than the child's best interest. The author isn't being selfish; they're making a tough choice for the child's benefit, even if it means losing a relationship. The ex's ability to have the daughter isn't being restricted\u2014only the schedule is adjusted. The author is also involving extended family to support the daughter's time, showing they're not trying to isolate her from the ex but to provide better care. The girlfriend's prioritization of her own time over the child's needs could be seen as the issue here. The author's actions are in line with their responsibility as a parent, especially given the ex's past issues. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole in this scenario.\n"
