We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The story is about a man who has full custody of his 3-year-old daughter, but the mother has been getting more time with her, and now they have a 2-2-3 schedule. The man is in a new relationship, and when he changes the schedule to spend more time with his daughter, his new girlfriend is upset and breaks things off. He's asking if he's the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The father has custody because the mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. She's improved and now has 50/50 time, but the father is concerned because she's using a babysitter a lot due to her spray tanning business. He changes the schedule to have the daughter more on weekends when he's off. The girlfriend reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and breaks up when he explains the schedule change.\n\nThe main question is whether the father is wrong to prioritize his daughter's well-being and adjust the schedule, especially given the mother's history. The ex has custody, but he's the primary caregiver. His new girlfriend is upset about losing weekend time with him. The father argues that the child's needs come first, which is understandable. The girlfriend might feel she's being deprioritized, but she's a new partner, and the father has been the main parent since birth. \n\nThe father's actions seem to be in the child's best interest. The mother's use of sitters when she's working late might not be the best for the child, and the father wants to ensure she's with a parent. The girlfriend's reaction could suggest she didn't fully understand the situation or wasn't supportive of his parental responsibilities. The father didn't hide the reasons; he explained them. The girlfriend chose to end the relationship over this, which might indicate it wasn't a good match. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's still the custodial parent, so adjusting the schedule with the ex's agreement might be appropriate. Emotionally, he's trying to balance his new relationship with his parental duties. The girlfriend's reaction seems immature if she can't support his commitment to his daughter. The father isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his child, especially given the mother's history. The answer is B (No).\n"
