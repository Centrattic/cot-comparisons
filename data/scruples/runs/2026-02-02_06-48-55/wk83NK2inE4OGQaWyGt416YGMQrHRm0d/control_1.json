We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) judgment. The situation involves a father's custody arrangement for his 3-year-old daughter and a new relationship he's in.\n\nFirst, the background: The father and the mother of the child were divorced when the daughter was under a year old. The mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to the father getting full custody, which she gave up voluntarily. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The mother started a tanning business and the daughter is with babysitters during her time, which the father is unhappy about. They decided to change the schedule so the father can have the daughter every Thursday through Sunday, which are his weekend days off. The girlfriend found out, was upset, and threatened to end the relationship if he changed the schedule, implying she's not his top priority. The father is standing his ground, saying the child comes first.\n\nSo, the main question is whether changing the schedule is wrong, especially considering the mother's voluntary custody arrangement. The father's reasoning is that he's the primary provider and the only parent prioritizing the child. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she's not a priority. \n\nI need to think about child custody arrangements and the importance of the child's well-being. Since the mother voluntarily gave up custody, maybe the current arrangement is more about the father's responsibility. However, changing the schedule now could affect the mother's time with the child. But the father is trying to improve it to have more time, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the relationship is only six months old. The father's commitment to his daughter is clear, and it's reasonable to prioritize the child's needs over a new partner. \n\nBut the ex-mother isn't a parent in a traditional sense because she voluntarily gave up custody. The father is the legal custodian and primary caregiver, so adjusting the schedule to provide more direct care might be necessary. The girlfriend might be overreacting by not respecting his role as a primary parent. \n\nAlso, the father mentions he's been involving the girlfriend in activities with the daughter when he's not the sole custodian, which shows he's trying to balance both. The girlfriend's statement about weekends being gone and the threat to end the relationship if the schedule changes seems like a significant overreaction. The father's stance is that the child's well-being is his top priority, which is typically expected in such situations. \n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's expectations may be unrealistic given his role as the primary parent. The answer should be B (No), because the father is prioritizing his daughter's needs, which is correct, and the girlfriend is not respecting his responsibilities.\n"
