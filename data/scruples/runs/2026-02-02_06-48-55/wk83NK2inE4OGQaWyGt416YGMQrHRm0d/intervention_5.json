We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a parent who changed their daughter's schedule to have her more weekends, which caused a conflict with their new partner. \n\nFirst, the author has custody of their 3-year-old daughter. The ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to the divorce and the author having full custody. The ex is trying to get 50/50 time, which they've been working on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The author is in a new relationship, and now they've changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday. \n\nThe partner reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and eventually breaks up, saying the author prioritizes the daughter over her. The author is firm in their decision, believing the child's needs come first. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's primary responsibility is to their daughter. Given the ex's history, the author might feel more responsible for the daughter's well-being. Changing the schedule to minimize babysitting and ensure the daughter is with a parent could be seen as responsible. \n\nHowever, the partner's reaction is about feeling de-prioritized. But the author had already been involving the partner in their time with the daughter when they didn't have custody. The new partner is upset that weekends are now taken up with the daughter. \n\nThe key points are: the author's commitment to their daughter's care, the ex's history, and the partner's expectations. The author might not be wrong because parents are supposed to prioritize their children's needs. The partner might need to adjust to the reality of the existing custody arrangements. \n\nBut maybe the author could have communicated better or considered the partner's feelings more. However, the author's stance is that the daughter comes first, which is a valid parental perspective. The partner might not have considered the prior situation with the ex. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
