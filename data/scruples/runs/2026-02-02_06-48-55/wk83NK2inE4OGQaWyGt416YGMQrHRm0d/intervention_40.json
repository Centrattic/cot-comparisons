We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a man who has full custody of his 3-year-old daughter, but his ex is now asking for more time. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Then he starts a new relationship, and his girlfriend gets upset when he changes the schedule to have the daughter more on weekends. The girlfriend ends up breaking up with him because she feels he's not prioritizing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user has custody, so he's allowed to make decisions regarding the child's schedule, right? The ex is working, and the kid is with sitters sometimes. The user wants to minimize that because he's concerned about the child's well-being. That seems like a reasonable concern. But the new girlfriend's reaction is that she's not his top priority. \n\nThe user's response is that the child will always be his top priority as a parent. But the girlfriend is upset because she feels the change in schedule affects their time together. The question is whether the user is wrong for changing the schedule because of the impact on the new relationship.\n\nFrom a parenting standpoint, ensuring the child has stable, loving relationships with both parents is important. The ex has a tanning business and may not be available, leading to sitters. The user is trying to create a schedule that reduces the time the child is with sitters. That seems like a valid reason. However, the user's response to the girlfriend's concerns might be where the problem lies. He mentions that his family can help with dates, but the girlfriend feels it's about her not being prioritized. \n\nBut is the user wrong to prioritize his daughter's needs over a new relationship? The girlfriend is in a new relationship, so maybe she expected him to have more availability. However, the user is a parent, and the daughter's well-being is his primary responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction might be about her own expectations versus the reality of his existing commitments as a parent. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong for making the schedule change to protect the child's time with both parents and reduce sitters. However, the way he handled the communication with his girlfriend could be an issue. He might need to consider her feelings and find a balance, but given that the child's needs are critical, he might not be at fault. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. The key is that he's prioritizing his child's well-being, which is his responsibility as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction is a personal issue, but the user isn't wrong for putting his child first.\n"
