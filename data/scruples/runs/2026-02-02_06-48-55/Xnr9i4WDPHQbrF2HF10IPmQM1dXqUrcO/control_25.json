I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's described as kinky, while the author is more vanilla and prudish. When they started having sex, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and she clearly stated that anal sex was a no-go. She also mentioned a past experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now the boyfriend is pressuring her to try it again, using various tactics like saying it doesn't hurt with lube or promising it won't hurt. He's even called her an asshole and accused her of being a prude. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author set a boundary right from the start. She communicated her refusal clearly. The boyfriend, however, isn't respecting that boundary and is pressuring her despite her clear no. Pressuring someone to engage in sexual activity they've said is off-limits is a red flag. Even if he believes she's being prudish, he's not respecting her consent and her past trauma. The fact that he's called her names and dismissed her feelings suggests a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior indicates he's not respecting her limits, which is a sign of potential control issues or disregard for her well-being. The author is standing up for herself, which is right. She's also considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing pressure, which shows she's prioritizing her comfort and safety.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that using more lube might help doesn't account for her past negative experience and her current refusal. It's not about whether it's physically possible but about respecting her emotional and physical boundaries. The fact that he continues to push despite her clear no is wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is violating her boundaries, which makes the answer B.\n"
