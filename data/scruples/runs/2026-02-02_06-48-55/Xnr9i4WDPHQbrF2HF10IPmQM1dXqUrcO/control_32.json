I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author is refusing to have anal sex, which her boyfriend wants. They had a discussion before where she set that boundary, but he keeps pushing her. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated that anal was a no-go from the start. She mentioned a past negative experience where it hurt and her previous partner didn't stop when she asked. That's important because it shows a valid reason for her refusal. Now, her current boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary by persistently pressuring her. The boyfriend's actions include not stopping when she says no and using manipulative tactics like guilt-tripping (\"you've never tried it with me\") and even calling her names like \"asshole\" and calling her prude. That's pretty clear disrespect.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries without pushing or pressuring. The boyfriend's behavior here is about trying to change her mind despite her firm stance, which is not healthy. The fact that he's dismissing her feelings and history with the issue shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author's considering ending the relationship because of this pressure is a reasonable response. So, the wrong here is definitely on the boyfriend's side. The author is not in the wrong for maintaining her boundaries and seeking a partner who respects them.\n"
