I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to engage in anal sex, but the author has a firm no to that. They mentioned they've already set this boundary clearly, even sharing a past experience where it was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her a prude and an asshole.\n\nFirst, consent and boundaries are key here. The author clearly communicated her refusal, so the boyfriend shouldn't be pressuring her further. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship suggests that the boundary isn't being respected, which is a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014continuing to push despite her clear no\u2014is not okay. Harassment or persistent pressure after a boundary is set is a sign of disrespect in a relationship. \n\nMoreover, the author's past experience with anal sex was traumatic, which adds another layer. The boyfriend should be considerate of her history and not dismiss her feelings. The argument that she hasn't tried it with him doesn't hold weight because she's already stated that it's a hard no, regardless of the method or circumstances. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners respect each other's limits without pressuring or shaming. The boyfriend's insistence and derogatory comments indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries, which is a major issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and wanting to maintain it. The boyfriend's actions are the problematic part here. So the answer should be B.\n"
