I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether not wanting to have anal sex makes someone the asshole in the relationship. \n\nFirst, looking at the backstory: the author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. They discussed boundaries early on, and the author clearly said anal sex is a no-go. The boyfriend keeps pushing despite her refusal, even after she mentioned a bad past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now he's pressuring her with various arguments, calling her names like \"prude,\" and she's considering ending it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author has set a clear boundary and communicated it. The boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't respecting that boundary and is persistently pressuring her. Even if anal sex is something he wants, respecting a partner's no is crucial. The fact that she's already tried compromising but he refuses suggests he's not meeting her halfway. His behavior of not stopping when she says no and using emotional manipulation (like calling her names) is problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, consent and respecting boundaries are key. The boyfriend's actions here seem to violate those principles. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary, especially given her past trauma. So the answer should be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
