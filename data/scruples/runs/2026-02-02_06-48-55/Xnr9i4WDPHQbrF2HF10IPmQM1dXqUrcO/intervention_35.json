I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has clearly communicated their boundary: anal sex is a no-go because of a past traumatic experience. They mentioned that when they told their partner to stop during a previous attempt, he didn't listen, leading to pain. Now, the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The author feels disrespected and is considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect for boundaries, and consent. The author has already set a firm boundary, which the partner is not respecting. Even if the partner is more into kink, that doesn't override the other person's no. The fact that the author has a history of trauma related to this activity adds another layer of sensitivity. The partner's continued insistence, including dismissing the author's concerns and even calling them a prude or an asshole, shows a lack of respect and empathy.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should honor each other's boundaries without pressure. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship because their boundaries aren't respected suggests the partner is not being considerate. The partner's behavior could be seen as coercive, which is a red flag.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but based on the analysis, it seems the partner is the one at fault. The author has communicated clearly, and the partner's persistence is disrespectful. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong). The partner's actions are the issue here, not the author's refusal.\n"
