I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about anal sex being a deal-breaker for the author, and the boyfriend not respecting that boundary. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has a history where a previous partner forced anal sex despite her saying stop, which caused pain. She clearly communicated this as a no-go with her current boyfriend. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring her again, not respecting her boundaries, and even calling her names. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has stated her limits, and the boyfriend is ignoring them. Even though he might be into kink, respecting her boundaries is crucial. The fact that she has a traumatic experience adds weight to her stance. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling her names, not stopping after she said no, and pressuring her\u2014could indicate disrespect. The author considering ending the relationship makes sense if he can't respect her no. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? No. She's standing up for her boundaries. The boyfriend is the one not respecting them. The answer should be B.\n"
