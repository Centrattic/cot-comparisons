I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship. She's described as vanilla and prudish, while her boyfriend is into kink. When they started having sex, she told him anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing for anal, saying things like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" She's considering ending the relationship because he won't stop pressuring her.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author clearly stated her boundary initially, so if the boyfriend is respecting that, they shouldn't be here. But he's not. He's pressuring her, which is a problem. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to check that.\n\nThe boyfriend called her a prude and an asshole, which is disrespectful. He's not respecting her no. Even if he's into kink, that doesn't mean he can't respect her limits. The author tried to compromise, but he refused. So the issue is his behavior, not hers. She's standing by her boundary, which is her right. The fact that he's pressuring her is wrong, so she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
