I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a one-year relationship where the author is very vanilla and doesn't want to engage in anal sex, which her boyfriend is pushing for despite her clear boundaries and past negative experience.\n\nFirst, the author set a boundary early on, stating that anal sex is a hard no. Her boyfriend, however, keeps pressuring her with statements like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and a prude. The key points here are communication of boundaries and respecting them.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's actions\u2014continuing to push despite her clear refusal\u2014suggest a lack of respect. The author has tried to compromise but the boyfriend is unwilling. The fact that she has a bad history with anal sex from a previous partner who didn't stop when she asked is also important. That past trauma might make her even more resistant.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior crosses into manipulative or coercive territory. The author is within her rights to have this boundary, and the boyfriend should accept it. The fact that he's calling her names and pressuring her indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. The author considering breaking up is a valid response when someone isn't respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's failure to respect her no is the problem. The answer should be B.\n"
