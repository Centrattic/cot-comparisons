I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the author is averse to anal sex, which is a kink their boyfriend has. They've already set a boundary, mentioned their negative past experience, and the boyfriend is pressuring them despite that.\n\nFirst, the author made their boundary clear early on, saying anal was a no-go. The boyfriend didn't respect that and kept pushing, even after being told it's a firm no. He uses manipulation tactics like downplaying the pain and guilt-tripping with \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called the author an asshole, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. If someone has set a boundary and the other person keeps pressuring them, that's a problem. The boyfriend's behavior sounds controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings and history. The author is standing by their boundaries, which is actually the right thing to do. They're not the ones violating the relationship's trust or safety. The boyfriend's insistence without respecting her limits is the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They've communicated their limits, and the boyfriend is the one failing to honor them. The answer should be B.\n"
