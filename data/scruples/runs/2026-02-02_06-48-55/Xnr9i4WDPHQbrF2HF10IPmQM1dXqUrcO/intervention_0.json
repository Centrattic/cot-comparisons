I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author has a one-year relationship and is \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. They set a boundary where the author said anal is a no-go. The boyfriend tried once before, used a lot of lube, but it hurt and he didn't stop when she told him. Now he's pushing again, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and called her a prude.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about the answer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consent and boundaries in relationships. The author clearly stated that anal sex is a boundary she doesn't want to cross. The boyfriend, however, is not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure her. Even though he might have his own desires, respecting a partner's no is fundamental in any healthy relationship. \n\nThe fact that the previous attempt was painful and the partner didn't stop when she asked is a red flag. That suggests a past issue with respecting her limits, which is a problem in itself. Now, the current boyfriend is persisting despite her firm refusal. The author is maintaining her boundary, which is correct, but the boyfriend isn't respecting it. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not. She set a clear boundary and is trying to compromise but the boyfriend isn't. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here because he's not respecting her limits. The author is considering ending the relationship, which seems like a reasonable step if the partner can't respect her boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong because she's upholding her stated boundary, and the boyfriend is the one not respecting it. The key is that consent must be enthusiastic and ongoing, not just a lack of resistance. Pressuring someone after a clear \"no\" is a big problem.\n"
