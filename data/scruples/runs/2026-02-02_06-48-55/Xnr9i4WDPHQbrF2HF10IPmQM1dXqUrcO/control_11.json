I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author has been with her boyfriend for a year. She's described as \"vanilla\" and \"prudish,\" while he's more into kink. When they started having sex, she clearly stated that anal was a no-go, and she even had a bad experience before where it hurt and the partner didn't stop. Now her current boyfriend is pressuring her to try it again, despite her refusal. She mentions that she's tried compromising, but he refuses. He's even called her a prude and an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author made her boundary clear from the start. The boyfriend is persisting despite her clear no. The previous bad experience adds to why she's not comfortable. The boyfriend's actions here\u2014pressuring, not respecting the boundary, and making derogatory comments\u2014seem problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. If one partner is pressuring the other for something they've said no to, that's a red flag. The boyfriend isn't respecting her limits, which is a form of disrespect or even emotional manipulation. The author is in a tough spot, but she's not the one violating any rules here. Her considering ending the relationship is a valid response if he's unwilling to respect her boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is the one at fault for not respecting her stated boundaries and pressuring her.\n"
