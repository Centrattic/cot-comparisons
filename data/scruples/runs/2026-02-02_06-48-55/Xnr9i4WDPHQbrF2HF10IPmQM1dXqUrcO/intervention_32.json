I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's very vanilla and prudish. She set a boundary early on that anal sex is a no-go, which he agreed to. However, he's been persistently pressuring her to have anal sex again, despite her clear refusals and her past negative experience. She's even told him she has a bad history with it, but he keeps pushing. He's even called her names and she's considering breaking up.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details. \n\nBoundaries in relationships are crucial. The author clearly communicated her boundaries from the start. The boyfriend's continued pressure after that could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that he used force in a previous attempt and didn't stop when she asked is a red flag. Now he's dismissing her boundaries, which is a form of coercion. \n\nThe author isn't the one violating boundaries here. She's standing by her no, and the boyfriend is the one who's not respecting that. The user's initial thought that the author might be wrong could be because of societal norms around sex, but in this case, respecting consent and boundaries is key. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is maintaining her boundaries, which is the correct approach. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here."
