I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go. They even mention a past bad experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. So they have valid reasons for their stance.\n\nThe boyfriend is pressuring them despite their clear refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which sounds like invalidation of their feelings and history. Also, calling them a prude and an asshole is disrespectful and dismissive of their boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their no. The boyfriend is the one not respecting the boundary and pressuring them. The author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if someone isn't respecting their limits. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
