I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is averse to anal sex, which their kinky boyfriend keeps pushing for despite her clear refusal. \n\nFirst, the author set a boundary from the start. She told her boyfriend that anal is a no-go, and she even had a bad experience before. He was aware of this. Now he's persistently pressuring her, using phrases like \"please\" and making excuses about lubrication or his method. He's even called her names and accused her of being prude.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated her limits clearly. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries by keeping up the pressure. Even if he's curious about trying new things, he needs to respect her \"no.\" The fact that he's called her an asshole and mocked her for being prude shows a lack of respect for her feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe user's question is asking if the author is in the wrong. From what's described, she's not. She's been upfront about her boundaries and is standing by them. The boyfriend is the one who's persistently violating those boundaries by not stopping after she said no multiple times. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing pressure makes sense, as healthy relationships require mutual respect and consent.\n\nSo the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
