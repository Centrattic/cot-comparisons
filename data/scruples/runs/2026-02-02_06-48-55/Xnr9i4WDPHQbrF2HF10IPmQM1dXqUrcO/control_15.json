I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author says they're with their boyfriend for a year, and they're very vanilla. The boyfriend is into kink. They set a boundary from the start that anal sex is a no-go. The boyfriend keeps pushing despite her refusal, even though she has a bad history with it. He uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. She's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. She told him early on that anal sex is off-limits. That's setting a boundary. He's respecting that initially? Wait, no, the problem is he's now pressuring her to do it despite her clear refusal. He's not respecting her boundary. She also mentions a past bad experience with anal sex where it hurt and he didn't stop when she asked. So he knows her history but is still pushing. That's a red flag. \n\nIn healthy relationships, boundaries should be respected. If he's pressuring her, that's a form of coercion. The fact that he's called her names like \"asshole\" and is dismissing her feelings as being prude is not okay. She's trying to compromise but he's not listening. The author is standing by her boundary, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions here are the issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries, making her the correct person here.\n"
