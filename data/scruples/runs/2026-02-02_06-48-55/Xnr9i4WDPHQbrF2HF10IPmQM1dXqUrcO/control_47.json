I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in a relationship. The author says they're vanilla and prudish, while their boyfriend is into kink. They've already set a boundary against anal sex, especially because of a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and he didn't stop. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and even calling her a prude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author clearly communicated their no to anal sex. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary and is pressuring her. Even if he's suggesting trying different methods, the key here is that she's not interested. Repeatedly asking after being told it's a firm no is a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be about his desires rather than respecting her limits. \n\nThe author mentions they tried to compromise, but the boyfriend refused. That shows she's made an effort. The boyfriend's use of manipulation and guilt-tripping (\"you've never tried it with me\") is concerning. Also, calling her a prude and an asshole is disrespectful. The author considering ending the relationship seems like a healthy response to someone not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and pressuring her. The author is not in the wrong for upholding her boundaries and seeking to leave a toxic situation. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
