I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where she refuses anal sex with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her boundaries from the start. She told her boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go. She also mentioned a bad past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. That's important because it shows she's not just being prudish but has a valid reason rooted in trauma.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is persistently pushing her to try it again, despite her clear no. He's using tactics like downplaying the pain (\"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\") and guilt-tripping her (\"you've never tried it with me\"). He even called her a prude and an asshole. That's not healthy communication. Respecting boundaries is crucial in any relationship, and pushing past them, especially when there's a history of trauma, is a red flag.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if the boyfriend isn't respecting her limits. The key points here are consent and respect. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, which is a major issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries and sticking to them. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
