I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex was a no-go. They also mentioned having a bad experience before where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when they said so. That's a red flag because consent and respecting boundaries are crucial.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is persistently pushing for it despite her refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"please,\" which might not be respecting her decision. The author is trying to compromise but feels the boyfriend isn't listening. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude, which is dismissive and disrespectful.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is essential. If someone keeps pressuring their partner after clear refusals, that's a problem. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here; she's trying to maintain them. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, so the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
