I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a year into a relationship and has clearly stated that anal sex is a boundary they won't cross. They mention a past experience where anal sex was painful and non-consensual when they asked to stop, which the current boyfriend knows about. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing for it, even after the author has said no multiple times. He uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which the author finds invalidating. The boyfriend has even called them a prude and an asshole. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let's break down the key points. The author has communicated their boundaries clearly. The boyfriend is pressuring them despite knowing their past trauma and current refusal. Pressuring someone after they've said no is a red flag. Respecting boundaries is crucial in any relationship. The boyfriend's behavior could be considered emotionally abusive, as he's dismissing the author's feelings and past experiences. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship is a reasonable response to ongoing disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had never discussed this and the boyfriend had suggested it once, maybe there's more nuance. But here, the author has already set a firm boundary, and the boyfriend is not respecting it. The boyfriend's insistence and invalidating comments show a lack of respect for consent and personal history. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their boundary; in fact, it's their right to do so. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
