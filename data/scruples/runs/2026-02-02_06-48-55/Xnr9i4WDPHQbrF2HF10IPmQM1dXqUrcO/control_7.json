I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex and differing boundaries between a couple.\n\nFirst, the author clearly states that anal sex is a firm no for them. They mention a past experience where it was painful and their partner didn't stop when they asked. That's a red flag for past trauma or lack of consent awareness. Now, the current boyfriend keeps pushing despite their refusal. The author has tried to communicate their boundary, which is essential in any healthy relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistently asking, dismissing her concerns, and even calling her names\u2014shows disrespect for her boundaries. In a healthy relationship, consent and mutual respect are key. If someone continues to pressure their partner after clear refusals, that's a violation of trust and respect. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship makes sense because respecting boundaries is fundamental.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They've communicated their limits, and the issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting those limits. The answer should be B.\n"
