I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her boundaries from the start. She told her boyfriend that anal sex was a no-go, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and he didn't stop. That's important because establishing boundaries is a key part of any healthy relationship, especially in terms of consent and mutual respect.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is pressuring her, using phrases like \"please\" and making claims that it won't hurt with lube. But the author has already explained her reasons, which include past trauma and personal preference. The boyfriend's behavior of continuing to push despite her clear no is a red flag. The fact that he called her a prude and an asshole suggests he's not respecting her boundaries, which is a big issue.\n\nIn relationships, consent and respect for each other's boundaries are crucial. If one partner keeps pressuring the other after they've said no, that's a form of emotional manipulation or even coercion. The author is standing by her boundaries, which is the correct approach. The boyfriend's actions here are what's problematic because he's not respecting her limits, which is a deal-breaker for many people. Ending the relationship might be the right choice for the author if the respect isn't there.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's respecting her own boundaries and communicated them clearly, while the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries and pressuring her.\n"
