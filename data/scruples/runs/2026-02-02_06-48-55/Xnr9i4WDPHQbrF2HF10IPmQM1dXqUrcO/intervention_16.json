I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author's boyfriend asked about boundaries initially, and she clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. He respected that at first. Now, he's persistently pushing her to try it again, using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and dismissing her concerns. She's uncomfortable, has a bad past experience, and is considering ending the relationship because he won't stop pressuring her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend is supposed to respect her boundaries, especially after she's made them clear. Pressuring someone into an activity they've said no to, especially after a negative experience, is a red flag. The author is standing her ground, which is important for her own comfort and safety. The boyfriend's behavior of calling her names and not respecting her refusal shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries without pressure. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining her no. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her limits and continuing to push. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
