I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundaries from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner. The boyfriend, however, keeps pushing and isn't respecting that boundary despite being told firmly. He even uses manipulative tactics and calls her names, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has the right to set limits in their sexual activities. The boyfriend's behavior sounds controlling and dismissive of her past trauma. The fact that he doesn't stop after she says no repeatedly is a red flag. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but that doesn't seem right. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her wishes. So the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
