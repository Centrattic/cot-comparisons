I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's pretty vanilla and prudish. When they started having sex, she told him that anal sex was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt even with lube and the guy didn't stop when she asked. Now he keeps pressuring her to try it again, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her a prude and an asshole. She's thinking of ending the relationship and asks who's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and boundaries. She clearly set a boundary at the beginning of the relationship. He asked, and she said no. Now he's not respecting that boundary. Her previous bad experience is also a red flag here because he should be considering her history and trauma. Pressuring someone for sex they don't want is a form of coercion, which is a violation of consent. \n\nHe's using emotional manipulation by calling her names, which is disrespectful. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he can't accept her no, that's on him. She's trying to compromise but he's not willing. His behavior indicates he's not respecting her boundaries, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe fact that she's considering ending the relationship suggests that the pressure is affecting their relationship negatively. The author isn't in the wrong because she's standing by her boundaries and not giving in to pressure. The boyfriend is the one crossing lines here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
