I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker for the author, but the boyfriend keeps pushing despite the author's clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author set a boundary from the start. They told the boyfriend it's a no-go, and even had a past experience where it was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. That's a significant red flag and a traumatic experience. The boyfriend, instead of respecting that, keeps pressuring her with statements like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and other dismissive comments. He even called her a prude and an asshole. \n\nRespecting boundaries is crucial in any relationship. The fact that the boyfriend isn't respecting her limits after she's clearly stated them shows a lack of respect for her consent and well-being. The author is firm in her stance, which is valid. People have different kinks and preferences, and it's okay to have boundaries that aren't crossed. The boyfriend's behavior here is the issue because he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe previous experience also adds context. The author had a bad experience where pain was ignored, so her hesitation is understandable. The boyfriend isn't acknowledging her past trauma but instead is trying to push through. That's not healthy. The author considering ending the relationship is a reasonable response when someone doesn't respect your boundaries. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one violating her stated boundaries and pressuring her into something she's against. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
