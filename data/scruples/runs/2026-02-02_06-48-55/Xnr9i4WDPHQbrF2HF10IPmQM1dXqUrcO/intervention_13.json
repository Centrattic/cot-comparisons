I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. The author is more vanilla and prudish. Early in the relationship, the boyfriend asked about sexual boundaries, and the author clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. The author has a past experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when asked. Now, the boyfriend is persistently pressuring the author to try anal sex again, despite their firm refusal. The author feels their boundaries aren't respected and is considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe author's main points: \n1. They set a clear boundary (no anal sex) early on.\n2. They have a negative past experience with anal sex, leading to pain and being ignored when they asked to stop.\n3. The boyfriend is pressuring them repeatedly, not respecting their boundary, and even called them a prude and an \"asshole.\"\n4. The author is struggling with whether they're in the wrong or their boyfriend is.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nLooking at consent and boundaries in relationships: A fundamental aspect of healthy relationships is respecting each other's boundaries. If someone has clearly communicated a boundary, and the other person continues to push against it, that's a violation. The boyfriend isn't respecting the author's stated limit. The author's past trauma adds another layer; pressuring someone with a history of negative experiences is especially problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's arguments about lube and technique don't matter if the person has already communicated that this act is off-limits. The key issue is respecting consent and boundaries. Even if the boyfriend believes the author might \"like it\" if they tried, that's not a valid reason to push. The author's autonomy and comfort are paramount.\n\nCalling someone a \"prude\" and an \"asshole\" is dismissive and disrespectful. It undermines the author's feelings and attempts to shame them for their boundaries. Healthy communication should involve mutual respect, not pressure or shaming.\n\nThe author's consideration of ending the relationship is a reasonable response when their boundaries are not respected. That suggests they value their own safety and comfort over the relationship, which is a valid choice.\n\nFrom a general perspective, the boyfriend is the one not respecting boundaries, so the author is not in the wrong. However, sometimes people might question if there's a compromise possible. But the author has already compromised by setting that boundary, and the boyfriend's continued pressure shows he's not willing to respect that. The author isn't obligated to change their boundaries unless they choose to, and their stated history makes it clear why this is a non-negotiable for them.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the right, and the boyfriend is the one in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
