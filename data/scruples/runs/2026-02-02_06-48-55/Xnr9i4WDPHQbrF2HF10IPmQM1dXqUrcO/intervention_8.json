I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author says they told their boyfriend upfront that anal is a big no for them, especially because of a bad past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing, not respecting their boundary, even calling them a prude and an asshole.\n\nSo, first, the author set a clear boundary from the start. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary, even after being told multiple times. The author is considering ending the relationship, which seems like a reasonable response when boundaries are not respected. The boyfriend's behavior is pressuring and dismissive of the author's feelings and history. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key point is consent and respecting boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to engage in a sexual act they set as a boundary. The boyfriend is the one who's wrong for not respecting that. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the info given, it seems the opposite. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
