I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about anal sex and a disagreement between a couple. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, let's recap the details. The user has been with their boyfriend for a year. They describe themselves as vanilla and prudish, while the boyfriend is kinky. When they started the relationship, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and the user clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. They had a bad experience before where it hurt even with lube, and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pressuring them, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The user feels the boyfriend isn't respecting their boundary and is considering ending the relationship. The boyfriend even called them an asshole and called them a prude.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user has clearly communicated their boundary. The boyfriend was aware of it from the start. The user tried compromising but the boyfriend isn't listening. The boyfriend isn't respecting their no, which is a red flag in any relationship. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. Pressuring someone into something they've explicitly said no to is not acceptable. The fact that the user has a past trauma related to anal sex adds another layer where the boyfriend's persistence could be triggering or harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend's response of calling them an asshole and questioning why they're prude is dismissive and invalidating. That kind of language can be abusive. The user is considering ending the relationship, which might be a valid decision given the lack of respect for their boundaries.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, the user has done their part by setting clear limits. The boyfriend's continued pressure despite knowing those limits suggests he's not respecting their autonomy. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to say no to any sexual activity they're uncomfortable with, and the boyfriend should accept that without coercion.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the boyfriend is just trying to explore his kinks and wants to share that with his partner. But kink sharing shouldn't come at the expense of another person's comfort and safety. Compromise is about meeting halfway, but if one partner is non-negotiable on a boundary, the other should respect that. The key issue is the persistence in pressuring after a clear \"no,\" which is a sign of disrespect and potential emotional manipulation.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The user mentioned they've tried compromising, but the boyfriend refuses to meet them halfway. This suggests a breakdown in communication where the boyfriend isn't listening. In healthy relationships, both parties should be able to discuss boundaries and find ways to satisfy each other without violating those boundaries. However, when one person repeatedly ignores the other's limits, it's a problem.\n\nAlso, the user's history with anal sex being painful and traumatic is important. The boyfriend's insistence might not just be about wanting the act itself but could be about proving that it's not bad with him. However, the user's trauma is a valid reason to avoid the activity, and the boyfriend's approach is invalidating their experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They've communicated their boundaries clearly, and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The pressure, lack of respect, and invalidating comments are signs of a problematic dynamic. The user's consideration to end the relationship is a reasonable response to being disrespected.\n"
