I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex was a no-go, especially because they had a bad experience before where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. So the author has valid reasons and has communicated their limits.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is persistently pushing despite her refusal. He's using phrases like \"try this or that\" and minimizing her concerns by saying it doesn't hurt with lube. He even calls her a prude and an asshole. That sounds like he's not respecting her boundaries and is pressuring her, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing pressure. She's tried compromising but he refuses. The key points here are communication of boundaries and respecting them. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic because he's not respecting her \"no\" and is using manipulation tactics. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's set clear boundaries and isn't budging on them. The boyfriend is the one who's crossing lines by pressuring her and not respecting her past experiences. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
