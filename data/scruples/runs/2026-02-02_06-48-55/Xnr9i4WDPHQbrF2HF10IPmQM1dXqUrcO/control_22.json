I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author clearly communicated their boundary against anal sex, but the boyfriend keeps pushing. \n\nFirst, the author stated upfront that anal sex is a no-go. They also mention a past bad experience where it was painful and the partner didn't stop when asked. Now, the boyfriend is persistently pressuring her, even after she said it's a firm no. He's using tactics like minimizing her concerns (\"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\") and invalidating her feelings (\"you're such a prude\"). The author is considering breaking up because of this ongoing pressure.\n\nBoundaries in relationships are crucial. If one partner sets a boundary and the other continues to push despite being told no, that's a red flag. The boyfriend isn't respecting her autonomy and her past trauma. The author isn't wrong for upholding her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is coercive and dismissive, which is not acceptable. So the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
