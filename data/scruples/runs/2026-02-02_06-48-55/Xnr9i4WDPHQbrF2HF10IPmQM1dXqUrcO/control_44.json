I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is pushing for anal sex despite the author clearly stating it's a no-go. The author has a past bad experience with anal sex that was painful and non-consensual. The boyfriend is pressuring her, using excuses like lube and different techniques, and even called her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author set a clear boundary from the start. Consent means respecting those boundaries. The boyfriend is not respecting her \"no,\" which is a red flag. Even if he's not forcing her physically, the constant pressure and emotional manipulation can be coercive. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this shows the severity of the issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes gaslighting or minimizing her feelings by saying \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and suggesting she hasn't tried it with him. This dismisses her valid reasons and trauma. Calling her a prude and an asshole is disrespectful and invalidates her feelings. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The boyfriend's actions here are not respecting her autonomy and safety.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong here because she's standing by her boundaries and seeking a partner who respects them. The boyfriend is the one violating consent norms by not accepting her limits. There's no indication the author is being unreasonable; she's had a traumatic experience and has communicated her boundaries clearly. The boyfriend's refusal to accept that and his pressuring behavior are the issues.\n"
