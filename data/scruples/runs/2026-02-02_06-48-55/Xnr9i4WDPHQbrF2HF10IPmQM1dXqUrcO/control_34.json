I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend despite his persistent requests.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. She's been with her boyfriend for a year and considers herself vanilla. He's into kink. When they started having sex, she explicitly told him that anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, he's pressuring her again, using various tactics like saying it won't hurt if they use lube, begging, and even calling her names. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a consent and boundaries perspective, she clearly set a boundary that anal sex is off-limits. She's communicated this multiple times, even mentioning her past trauma. The boyfriend is pressuring her, which is a red flag. Pressuring someone into a sexual act after they've set a boundary is not acceptable. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of not respecting her \"no\" and continuing to push, along with name-calling, indicates a lack of respect. The fact that he's using manipulation tactics (\"I promise it won't hurt\") is coercive. She's trying to compromise but he's not willing to accept her stance. \n\nHer considering ending the relationship is a logical response because the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. There's no indication that she's being unreasonable. She's already tried to be open to other things but this specific boundary is non-negotiable for her. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
