I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kinky stuff. She's described as vanilla and prudish. When they first started sex, she clearly told him that anal sex is a firm no for her. She has a past experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try it again, using various tactics like \"it won't hurt with lube\" and even calling her names like \"asshole\" and \"prude.\" She's considering ending the relationship because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nFrom what I understand, consent and respecting boundaries are crucial in relationships. The author has already communicated her no, and the boyfriend is pressuring her despite that. Even if he finds her boundaries prude, that doesn't make her wrong. She's also mentioned a bad past experience, which adds to her valid reasons for not wanting to engage in anal sex. The boyfriend's behavior of not respecting her limits and continuing to pressure her is problematic. \n\nThe key points here are that she set a clear boundary and he's not honoring it. She's trying to compromise, but he's not. The boyfriend's actions, like calling her names and persisting despite her refusal, indicate a lack of respect for her consent. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's limits is essential. If he can't respect hers, that's a red flag. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
