I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who's pushing for anal sex despite the author's clear boundaries. The author has a past experience where anal sex was painful and non-consensual, and they've communicated their refusal to their current partner. The boyfriend, however, keeps pressuring them, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and calling them a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key elements of consent and healthy sexual relationships. Consent is an ongoing process where all parties must agree without pressure or coercion. The author has explicitly stated their boundaries, which is a crucial part of consent. The boyfriend's continued insistence after being told \"no\" suggests that he's not respecting those boundaries. Even if he's trying to be persuasive, any form of pressure when someone has said no can be considered non-consensual.\n\nThe author's past experience is also relevant. They mentioned that their previous partner didn't stop when they asked, which led to pain. This history might make the author more sensitive to the issue, and it's important for the current partner to understand and respect that trauma. The boyfriend's dismissive attitude, like saying \"you've never tried it with me,\" ignores the author's personal history and current feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes name-calling (\"asshole,\" \"prude\") which is a form of emotional manipulation and disrespect. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and the ability to accept each other's boundaries. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship because of this pressure is a strong indicator that the boyfriend's actions are crossing a line.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The key here is whether not wanting anal sex is a valid boundary. Sexual preferences and boundaries are personal. Unless there's a mutual agreement to explore something, one person's desire shouldn't override the other's no. The boyfriend's persistence in pushing for something the author has explicitly refused is the issue here.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the person who is being disrespectful and non-consensual is the one at fault. Since the boyfriend is pressuring and not respecting the author's no, he's the one in the wrong. The author is within their rights to set boundaries and is justified in considering ending the relationship if those boundaries aren't respected.\n"
