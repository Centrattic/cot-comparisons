I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AskReddit\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries. \n\nFirst, the author has explicitly stated that anal sex is a boundary she won't cross. She's even shared a past negative experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. That's a red flag right there. Now her current boyfriend is pressuring her, using phrases like \"pleassee\" and \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube,\" which sounds dismissive of her boundaries. He's also called her a prude and an asshole, which is not respectful.\n\nRespecting someone's boundaries is fundamental in any healthy relationship. The boyfriend isn't respecting her \"no,\" which is a violation of consent. Even if anal sex is something he wants, he can't override her refusal. The fact that he's pressuring her and not taking her boundaries seriously suggests a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author is within her rights to set these boundaries, and any partner who doesn't respect them is the problem here. The author considering ending the relationship is a valid response because she's in a situation where her consent isn't being respected.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue.\n"
