I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship. The author clearly stated their boundary from the start and has a bad experience with anal sex in the past. The boyfriend is pressuring them despite their refusal, even after they've said it's a firm no. The boyfriend's responses like \"you've never tried it with me\" and using lube as a solution don't respect her boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions they've tried to compromise, but the boyfriend isn't listening. He even called her names like \"asshole\" and accused her of being prude. The key points here are communication of boundaries and respect for them. If someone has set a clear boundary and the other person continues to pressure them, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting her no, which is a red flag. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary. So, answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
