I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend it was a \"huge no go\" and mentioned a past negative experience. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is pushing for it despite her refusal, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"pleassee.\" He even called her an asshole and called her prude. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated her limits, and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. The boyfriend's actions\u2014persisting after being told no, not respecting her history, and being dismissive\u2014are problematic. The author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if someone isn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the boyfriend is clearly in the wrong here. The author isn't the one violating boundaries; she's the one who set them and is standing by them. The boyfriend's behavior is pressuring her into something she's uncomfortable with, which is a red flag in any relationship. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
