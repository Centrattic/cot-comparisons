I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend repeatedly pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author explicitly stated anal sex is a no-go, citing past trauma where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. That's a significant red flag right there. The current boyfriend, despite being told no multiple times, keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you haven't tried it with me.\" That sounds like invalidating her experience and not respecting her limits.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior crosses into manipulation and disrespect. He even calls her names and accuses her of being prudish, which is an attack on her for setting boundaries. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. If one partner doesn't respect the other's clear boundaries, especially ones rooted in past negative experiences, that's a major issue.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense given the persistent pressure and lack of respect. The boyfriend's actions don't align with healthy communication or consent. The fact that she's vanilla and he's into kink isn't the problem; the problem is his inability to accept her limits. Kink can be part of a consensual relationship, but only if all parties are on board. Since she's not, and he's not respecting that, he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong; her boyfriend is for not respecting her boundaries and pressuring her into something she's clearly against.\n"
