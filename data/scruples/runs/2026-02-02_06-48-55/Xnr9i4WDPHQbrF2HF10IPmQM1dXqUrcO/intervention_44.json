I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe author says they told their boyfriend upfront that anal sex is a no-go. They had a bad experience before, and now he's pressuring them again despite their refusal. The boyfriend is using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which the author finds invalidating. Also, he's called them a prude and an asshole. The author is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the main points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. If the author clearly communicated their boundary and the boyfriend is pressuring them, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting their limits, which is a red flag. The fact that the author has a past negative experience makes it even more important for the boyfriend to respect their decision. Compromise isn't about ignoring one's boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistent pressure and name-calling\u2014indicates a lack of respect. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their boundary. The boyfriend is the one violating the agreed-upon terms of their relationship. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
