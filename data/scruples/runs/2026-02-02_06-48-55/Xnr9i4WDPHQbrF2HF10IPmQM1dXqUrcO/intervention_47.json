I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend is pushing for anal sex despite the partner's clear refusal and past negative experience. The author of the Reddit post (AITA) is the one refusing, and the boyfriend is persistently asking and even making hurtful comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. When they started the relationship, the author had already communicated that anal sex was a no-go. The boyfriend asked about boundaries, and she made it clear. Now he's pressuring her again, even after she's reaffirmed her stance. That's important because respecting someone's boundaries is crucial in any relationship, especially in sexual contexts.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes not just asking but begging, making promises that it won't hurt, and even calling her names like \"asshole\" and labeling her as prude. This kind of pressure can be emotionally coercive. The author has a history of trauma with anal sex, as it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. That's a significant red flag for the current partner to recognize and respect.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be at fault but is now seeking opinions. The key points here are about respecting boundaries, past trauma, and the boyfriend's persistence despite clear rejections. In healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's limits without pressuring them to change their minds. The boyfriend's actions seem to be violating those boundaries, which is a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries and causing emotional distress. Therefore, the correct answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
