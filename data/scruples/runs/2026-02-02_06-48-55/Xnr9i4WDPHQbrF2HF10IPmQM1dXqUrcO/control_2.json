I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker for the author.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundary early on in the relationship. They mentioned they're \"vanilla,\" and the boyfriend is \"kinky.\" She told him anal was a no-go, and she even tried it once with a previous partner which was painful and ended badly. Now the boyfriend keeps pressuring her, saying things like using lube would help, and even calling her names like \"prude.\" \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author has already stated her boundaries and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. Even if he's into kink, pushing her to do something she's against is not okay. The fact that he's persistently pestering her, not listening when she says no, and even making her feel bad by calling her names shows he's not respecting her consent. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here; she's standing by her stated limits. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because he's pressuring her into something she's clearly against. The author considering ending the relationship might be a valid choice here since mutual respect is crucial in a relationship. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
