I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex in a relationship.\n\nThe author has been with their boyfriend for a year. They describe themselves as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, he asked about boundaries, and she clearly said anal is a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt, and the guy didn't stop when she asked. Now he's pressuring her again, using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and dismissing her boundaries. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude. She's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries in relationships. The author set a clear boundary right from the start. He was supposed to respect that. The fact that he's pressuring her after she said no is a big issue. Pressuring someone after they've stated a boundary is a red flag. Also, the previous experience where he didn't stop when she asked is concerning. That sounds like a violation, which could be a sign of disrespect or even abuse.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication and respect for boundaries are key. If he's not respecting her \"no,\" he's overstepping. The author is within her rights to maintain her boundaries. The fact that he's called her names and is pressuring her despite her clear refusals makes him the problematic one here.\n\nThe answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing by her boundaries, which is correct. The boyfriend is the one at fault for not respecting them and applying pressure.\n"
