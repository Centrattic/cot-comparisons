I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to engage in anal sex with her boyfriend despite his persistent requests.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start, stating that anal sex is a no-go. She mentioned a past experience where it was painful and the previous partner didn't respect her when she asked to stop. Now, her current boyfriend is pressuring her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which the author finds dismissive of her boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems to be crossing the line by not respecting her established boundary. Even though he might be curious or interested, respecting a partner's no is fundamental in any healthy relationship. The author is firm in her stance, and the boyfriend's reactions\u2014calling her a prude and persistent begging\u2014indicate he's not respecting her limits. The author's consideration to end the relationship suggests she's reached her limit, which is a valid response when boundaries aren't respected.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but based on the details, it's clear the boyfriend is the one violating the agreed-upon boundary. The key point is that respecting no is non-negotiable. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
