I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has been with their boyfriend for a year. They describe themselves as very vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they first started, he asked about boundaries, and she said anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience with anal sex before, where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, he keeps pressuring her to try it again, even after she's firm in her refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which she finds dismissive. He's even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The key points are about respecting boundaries. The author set a clear boundary, and the boyfriend is not respecting that. In healthy relationships, consent and respecting each other's limits are crucial. The boyfriend's persistence despite her refusal is red flag behavior. The fact that he minimized her past negative experience and continued to pressure her suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. The author's refusal is valid, especially given her trauma. Ending the relationship over this seems justified because the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, which is a major issue. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
