I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundary from the start. They mentioned they're \"vanilla\" and their boyfriend is \"kinky.\" When they started the relationship, the author explicitly told him anal sex was off-limits. The boyfriend used to be aware of this. However, now he's persistently pushing for it despite her refusal. The author even has a bad past experience with anal sex where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. \n\nThe boyfriend is now pressuring her with phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"please,\" which are classic examples of dismissing her boundary. Calling her a prude and an asshole is disrespectful. The author is considering ending the relationship because of the constant pressure and lack of respect for her limits.\n\nBoundaries in relationships are crucial. If one partner consistently ignores or undermines the other's boundaries, that's a red flag. The key here is that the author has communicated her boundary, and the boyfriend isn't respecting it. The fact that he's even bringing up past experiences where she had a negative reaction (the previous partner not stopping) suggests he's not listening to her current concerns.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but based on the details, it seems the boyfriend is the one violating consent and boundaries. The author has every right to maintain her boundaries without being shamed or pressured. So the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
