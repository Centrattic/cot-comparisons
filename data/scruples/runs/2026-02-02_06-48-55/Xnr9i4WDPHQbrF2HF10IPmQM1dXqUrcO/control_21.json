I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex being a dealbreaker. The author's boyfriend is pressuring her to do something she's strongly against. She's already set the boundary and explained her reasons, including a past negative experience. The boyfriend is ignoring her boundaries and even calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries in relationships. Consent is crucial, and respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author has clearly stated her no to anal sex. The boyfriend isn't respecting that, which could be a sign of disrespect. The fact that he's using the past experience where someone else forced her might be making her uncomfortable again. \n\nThe boyfriend's statements like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me\" could be minimizing her feelings. He's pressuring her to change her mind, which isn't healthy. The author is considering ending the relationship because he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's not respecting her boundaries, which is a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong because she's standing by her boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are the problem. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
