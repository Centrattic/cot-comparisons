I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a vanilla person in a relationship with a more kinky boyfriend. They set a clear boundary against anal sex from the start because of a bad past experience. The boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling her names like \"asshole.\" The author is considering breaking up.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but wants others' opinions. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to analyze the situation. The key points are consent, boundaries, and respect. The author clearly communicated their refusal, which is a fundamental aspect of healthy relationships. The boyfriend is pressuring her, which is not acceptable. Pressuring someone into sex, especially against their stated boundaries, is a violation. The boyfriend's behavior is dismissive and disrespectful, using manipulation tactics. The author isn't in the wrong here; they're standing by their boundaries. The problem lies with the boyfriend not respecting those boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
