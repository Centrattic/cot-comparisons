I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend described as \"kinky,\" while the author is \"vanilla\" and \"prudish.\" When they first started having sex, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and the author clearly said anal sex is a no-go. There's a history here: a previous partner used a lot of lube but still caused pain, and the author told him to stop, but he didn't. The current boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try anal sex, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The author feels this is crossing a boundary she's already communicated. The boyfriend has even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. The author is thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer should be either A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider consent and boundaries. The author clearly stated her boundaries from the start. The boyfriend seems to be pressuring her, which is not okay. Consent requires respecting the other person's boundaries without coercion. The fact that she's had a traumatic experience before with anal sex adds weight to her current refusal. The boyfriend's insistence, especially after being told it's a firm no, suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. Calling her names and being dismissive of her past trauma is also problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is not compromising enough, but she mentioned she's tried to compromise, but the boyfriend refuses. The key here is that the author has communicated her no, and the boyfriend is persisting. In healthy relationships, partners respect each other's boundaries without pressure. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful.\n\nThe author's consideration to end the relationship seems justified given the ongoing pressure and lack of respect for her boundaries. So, the boyfriend is the one not respecting her, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
