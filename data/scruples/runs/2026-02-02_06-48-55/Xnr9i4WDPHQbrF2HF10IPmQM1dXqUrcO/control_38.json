I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about anal sex and boundaries between a couple.\n\nFirst, the author has clearly communicated their boundary to their boyfriend. They mentioned they tried anal sex once before, it hurt, and the other person didn't stop when asked. Now, their current boyfriend is pushing them despite their firm refusal. The author has told him it's a no-go and doesn't want to cross that boundary. The boyfriend is persistently pressuring them, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling them a prude. The author is considering breaking up because of this.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has already stated their limits, which is essential in any relationship. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like pressuring and maybe even coercing, which is not okay. He's not respecting her no, and that's a red flag. The fact that he called her an asshole and questioned her prudishness shows a lack of respect for her feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they are upholding their own boundaries and communicating them clearly. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here\u2014he should accept her no and not push for something she's not comfortable with. Compromise is important, but not when one person is forcing their will on the other. The author is right to consider ending the relationship if the boyfriend can't respect her limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
