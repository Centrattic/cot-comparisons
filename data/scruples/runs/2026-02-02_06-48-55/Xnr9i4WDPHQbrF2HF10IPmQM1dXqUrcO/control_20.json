I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship. The author, who's been with their boyfriend for a year, is very vanilla and prudish. The boyfriend is into kinkier stuff. When they first started, the author clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. The boyfriend now keeps pushing for it despite her refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author set a clear boundary, which the boyfriend is ignoring. Repeatedly pressuring someone after they've said no is a big red flag. The boyfriend's behavior, like calling her names and not respecting her refusal, is problematic. Also, the author mentions a bad past experience with anal sex where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. That history adds context to her resistance.\n\nThe boyfriend's arguments about using lube or trying again don't matter if she's not willing. Consent isn't about finding ways around a no; it's about respecting the no. The key points here are about respecting established boundaries, not using manipulation, and acknowledging past trauma. The boyfriend's actions suggest he's not respecting her autonomy, which is a serious issue. The author considering ending the relationship is a valid response given the lack of respect from her partner. So, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
