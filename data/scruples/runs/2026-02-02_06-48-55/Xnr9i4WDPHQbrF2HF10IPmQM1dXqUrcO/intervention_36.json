I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex. The author is a woman who is with a boyfriend she's been with for a year. She describes herself as vanilla and prudish, while he's more into kink. When they started having sex, she told him anal was a no-go. She tried it once with a previous partner who hurt her even with lube, and he didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her for anal sex despite her firm refusal, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and a prude. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is to answer A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author has clearly established her boundary. She's communicated that anal sex is a deal-breaker. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary and is pressuring her, using manipulative tactics. He even called her names. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is crucial. Pressuring someone beyond their stated limits, especially after a negative experience, is a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and dismissive of her feelings. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary and standing by it. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting it. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
