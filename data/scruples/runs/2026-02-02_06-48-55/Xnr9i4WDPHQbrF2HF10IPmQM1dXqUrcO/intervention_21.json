I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to engage in anal sex, but the author has a firm no to that. The boyfriend keeps pushing despite her clear boundaries and even called her names. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author explicitly stated that anal sex is a no-go, and even the one time she tried it with a previous partner was painful and not consensual when he didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend is pressuring her, not respecting her stated boundaries. That seems like a red flag. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If someone is being pressured or forced into any sexual activity they're not comfortable with, that's a violation of consent. The boyfriend's behavior of not stopping after being told to stop, using manipulative tactics like \"you've never tried it with me,\" and even calling her names suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which is a valid response when someone disrespects your boundaries repeatedly. The boyfriend's actions could be a sign of emotional manipulation or even emotional abuse. The key points here are the clear communication of boundaries by the author and the boyfriend's disregard for those boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. She set her boundaries, communicated them, and her partner isn't respecting them. The boyfriend's actions are the issue, making the author the right person in this situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
