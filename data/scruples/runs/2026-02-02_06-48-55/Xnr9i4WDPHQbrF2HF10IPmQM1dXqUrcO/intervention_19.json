I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's more into kink. She's very vanilla and prudish, and she told him from the start that anal sex is a no-go. She tried it once before with another partner, and it hurt a lot, and he didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pushing her for anal, even after she's said no and explained her reasons. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" and even called her an asshole and called her a prude. She's thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. She clearly set a boundary. He asked about her limits, and she told him anal was off-limits. He didn't respect that boundary and kept pushing. Even after she explained her past trauma, he continued to pressure her. The boyfriend's actions here seem to be about pressure and not respecting her no. The fact that he called her names adds to the disrespect. \n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want to know others' opinions. But according to me, the author isn't wrong. She set a boundary, and the boyfriend didn't respect it. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect and consent are crucial. If one partner doesn't want to engage in a certain activity and the other keeps pushing, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting her autonomy, which is a red flag. The fact that she has a bad history with anal sex from a previous partner who didn't stop when she asked adds to her valid reasons for not wanting to do it again. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that using lube would help isn't valid because consent isn't about the physical aspects; it's about respecting the person's wishes. Also, the phrase \"you've never tried it with me\" is a manipulative tactic to make her feel like her refusal is based on not giving him a chance, but she's already made it clear it's not about the experience with him\u2014it's a personal boundary. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the boyfriend is the one not respecting boundaries, being pushy, and using coercion. The author is standing up for her limits, which is appropriate. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
