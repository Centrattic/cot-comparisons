I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundary from the start. They mentioned they're vanilla and set a firm no to anal sex. Their past experience was bad, and they've tried to compromise but the boyfriend isn't respecting that. The boyfriend is pressuring them, using phrases like \"pleassee\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which sounds manipulative. He even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude, which is disrespectful.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend isn't respecting her clear no, which is a red flag. The author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if the partner isn't respecting her limits. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They set boundaries and the issue is the boyfriend not honoring them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
