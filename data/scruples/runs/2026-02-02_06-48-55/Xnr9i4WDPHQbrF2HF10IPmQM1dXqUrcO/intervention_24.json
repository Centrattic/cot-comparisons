I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend wanting to have anal sex, but the author has a firm no to that. The author mentions they've communicated their boundary clearly, even after trying once before with a previous partner who didn't stop when they asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pressuring them, even calling them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author has already stated their limit, so the boyfriend's continued pressure is a red flag. Healthy relationships require respecting each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like coercion, especially since he's not respecting her \"no\" and is using manipulative tactics like saying it won't hurt with lube or bringing up that she hasn't tried it with him. \n\nThe author's history with anal sex is negative, and they've tried compromising, but the boyfriend isn't willing to accept their limits. The fact that he called her an asshole and called her prude suggests disrespect. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's boundaries, not badger them to cross lines they've set. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their boundary. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. The author is justified in considering ending the relationship because their partner isn't respecting their limits, which is a key part of a respectful and consensual relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
