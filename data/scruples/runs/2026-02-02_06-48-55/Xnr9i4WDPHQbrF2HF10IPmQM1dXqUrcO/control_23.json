I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the author is refusing to have anal sex, and the boyfriend keeps pushing despite the refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author made it clear that anal sex is a firm no for them. They mentioned a past experience where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when they asked. Now, the boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary, using pressure tactics, and even calling the author a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, consent and respecting boundaries are crucial. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like harassment because he's not stopping after being told no. He's using manipulative language like \"pleassee\" and comparing his method to maybe making it better, which isn't respecting the author's stated limits. The fact that he called the author an asshole and criticized them for being a prude adds emotional harm. \n\nThe author isn't at fault here. They set a boundary upfront and reiterated it. The boyfriend's actions are the issue because he's not respecting that boundary. The author is within their rights to not engage in anal sex and to end the relationship if the partner continues to push. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
