I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points from the story.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink, while she's more vanilla and prudish. When they started having sex, she clearly stated her boundaries, specifically that anal sex is a no-go. She has a bad history with anal sex from a previous partner who didn't stop when she asked, causing pain. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try it again, using various arguments like using more lube or saying it won't hurt. She's firm in her refusal, but he's not respecting that, even calling her names and questioning her prudishness. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about consent, respecting boundaries, and communication. The author set a clear boundary early on, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. The fact that she has a traumatic experience adds to the seriousness because he should be aware of that and not push her. Even if anal sex is something he wants, her refusal is a hard limit. Pressuring someone beyond their stated boundaries is a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014continuously begging, not respecting her \"no,\" and making derogatory comments\u2014suggests he's not taking her consent seriously. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries without pressure or coercion. The author isn't wrong for maintaining her limits. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here because he's not honoring her consent and is instead pressuring her, which can be considered abusive. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this is understandable, as mutual respect is crucial. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author has done anything wrong. She communicated her boundaries, and it's the boyfriend who's failing to respect them. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
