I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pushing for it despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a history where a previous partner forced anal sex despite her asking to stop, which is a serious issue. Now her current boyfriend is pressuring her again, even after she stated it's a hard no. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which might be minimizing her trauma and invalidating her consent. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but I need to challenge that. The author has communicated her boundaries clearly, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like he's not respecting those boundaries, especially after her past trauma. Pressuring someone into something they don't want, especially with a history of coercion, is a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend calling her a prude and an asshole is dismissive and disrespectful. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. The author considering ending the relationship might be the right decision if the boyfriend isn't willing to respect her boundaries. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting consent and boundaries. The author isn't the one in the wrong because she's clearly stated her limits. The boyfriend's actions are the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
