I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to have anal sex with her boyfriend despite his persistent requests.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who is more into kink, while she's more vanilla. They had an initial conversation where she set a boundary about anal sex being a no-go. She mentions a past experience where anal sex was painful and she was forced to stop, which the boyfriend knows. Now he's pressuring her again, saying things like \"it won't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" She's considering ending the relationship because he's not respecting her boundary and has even called her a prude and an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but is seeking others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, the key here is that the author has clearly communicated her no to anal sex. The boyfriend is continuing to pressure her, which is a violation of her boundaries. Even if he's trying to persuade her with different methods, the fact that she's said no and he's not respecting that is a red flag. Her past negative experience adds context to why she's hesitant, and he's aware of that. His behavior of persistently pushing the issue, using guilt-tripping tactics, and making derogatory comments suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. If one partner is pressuring the other for something that's been refused, especially after having prior negative experiences, that's a sign of disrespect. The boyfriend's actions here are coercive, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship because of this is understandable given the lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be at fault, but based on the information, it's the boyfriend who's in the wrong for not respecting her no. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
