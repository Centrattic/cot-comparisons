I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (AITA) is at fault for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author has been with her boyfriend for a year. She describes herself as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, she clearly stated that anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, he keeps pressuring her, saying things like using lube would help, and he's even called her an asshole and called her a prude. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. She's communicated her boundaries clearly, but he's not respecting them. The previous trauma with anal sex is important\u2014she had a bad experience, and now he's pressuring her despite her refusal. The boyfriend isn't respecting her limits, which is a major red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If someone continues to pressure a partner after they've set a boundary, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response of calling her an asshole and labeling her as prude is dismissive and disrespectful. His behavior suggests that he's not taking her feelings seriously. The author is standing her ground and considering ending the relationship because of this, which makes sense given the pressure and disrespect she's facing.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? No. She's clearly communicated her limits and is not backing down despite the pressure. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
