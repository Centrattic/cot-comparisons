I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The author is a Reddit user who posted about not wanting to have anal sex, despite the boyfriend's persistent requests.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundary early in the relationship. They mentioned they're \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is kinky. The author told the boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go. The boyfriend, however, is pushing hard, using phrases like \"pleassee\" and \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube,\" and even called the author an asshole and called them a prude. The author has a bad history with anal sex from a previous partner, which the current boyfriend is aware of.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author has stated their limits, and the boyfriend isn't respecting those. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be pressuring the author beyond their comfort zone. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this. \n\nNow, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. But based on what's described, the author is standing by their boundaries, which is healthy. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that are problematic\u2014disregarding the author's stated limits, pressuring them, and even mocking them. The author isn't the one violating consent here; they're the ones trying to maintain their boundaries.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one at fault for not respecting the author's limits and pressuring them into something they've said no to. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship is a reasonable response to a partner who isn't respecting their boundaries.\n"
