I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start, saying anal sex was a no-go. The boyfriend is pressuring her despite her refusal. She mentions a bad experience in the past where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calls her a prude. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author established a clear boundary, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Pressuring someone to engage in a sexual act they've said no to is a form of coercion, which is not okay. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning, especially given the past trauma she mentioned. The fact that she's considering breaking up because he won't respect her boundaries suggests that he's not taking her needs seriously.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect is essential. If one partner is continuously pressuring the other without respecting their limits, that's a red flag. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here; she's trying to maintain hers. The boyfriend's insistence and dismissive comments (\"you're a prude\") show a lack of respect for her feelings and history. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one at fault for not respecting her boundaries and pressuring her.\n"
