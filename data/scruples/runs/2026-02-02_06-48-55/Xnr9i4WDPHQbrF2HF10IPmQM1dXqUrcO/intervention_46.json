I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend. The author explains they're vanilla and prudish, the boyfriend is into kink. When they first started dating, they set a boundary against anal sex because of a bad experience with a previous partner. Now the boyfriend keeps pressuring them, even after they've clearly said it's a no-go. The boyfriend uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" and even called the author a prude.\n\nSo the main points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated their boundary clearly. The boyfriend isn't respecting that and is pressuring them. In healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. Pressuring someone into a sexual act they've refused is a problem. The fact that the author had a traumatic experience with anal sex in the past adds another layer, as the current partner should be aware of that history and not push.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking opinions. The answer options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not). Based on the information, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the issue here\u2014ignoring the boundary, pressuring for an activity the author has explicitly refused. The author is not in the wrong for setting and maintaining that boundary. So the answer should be B.\n"
