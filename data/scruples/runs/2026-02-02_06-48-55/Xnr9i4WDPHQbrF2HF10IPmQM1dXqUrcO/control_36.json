I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship. The user (AITA) has been with her boyfriend for a year. She's described as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, she told him upfront that anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where it hurt and her ex didn't stop when she asked. Now, he's pressuring her again, using various arguments. She's firm in her refusal, but he's not respecting that and even called her names. She's thinking of breaking up.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, she set a clear boundary from the beginning. That seems important. He was aware of her limits. Now, he's not respecting that boundary and is pressuring her. Pressuring someone into sex they don't want is a big red flag. Also, she's had a traumatic experience with anal sex before, and he knows that. His responses like \"it won't hurt if you use lube\" or \"you haven't tried it with me\" dismiss her feelings and the past trauma. Disrespecting boundaries, especially after being told directly, is a problem. He even called her names like \"asshole,\" which is disrespectful. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author made her boundaries clear, so he's the one not respecting them. She's not the one in the wrong here. The boyfriend is pressuring her into something she's not comfortable with, which isn't okay. Even if he's more into kinky stuff, a healthy relationship should respect each other's limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
