I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author is with her boyfriend for a year, and he's been pushing her for anal sex despite her clear refusal.\n\nFirst, the author set a boundary from the start. She told him that anal sex was a no-go and mentioned a bad experience where someone didn't stop when she asked. Now the boyfriend is persistently trying to convince her, even using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and calling her a prude. He even used the term \"asshole\" in frustration.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and respect. The author communicated her limit clearly. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary and is pressuring her, which is a form of coercion. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. Pressuring someone into an activity they've refused is not acceptable. The author's consideration to end the relationship because of the pressure suggests that the boyfriend's behavior is toxic.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the analysis, it's more likely the boyfriend is the one in the wrong. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
