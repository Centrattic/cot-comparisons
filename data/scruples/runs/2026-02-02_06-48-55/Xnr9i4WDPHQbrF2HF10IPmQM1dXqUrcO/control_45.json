I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The main issue is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship. She's described as vanilla and prudish, while her boyfriend is more into kink. When they started having sex, she told him anal was a no-go. She tried it once with a previous partner, it hurt, he didn't stop when she asked, and now she's clear that she doesn't want to do it. The boyfriend keeps pushing her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He also called her a prude and an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The woman set a clear boundary when the relationship started. She's had a bad experience in the past, which adds to her current refusal. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries by continuing to pressure her. Even if he's trying to convince her, constant pressure after a firm no is a red flag. Respecting a partner's \"no\" is fundamental in any healthy relationship. The fact that he's called her names and is persistently trying to get her to change her mind suggests he's not taking her boundaries seriously. \n\nThe author's actions are about maintaining her own limits, which is her right. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since she communicated her boundaries and is standing by them, while he's not respecting those boundaries, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The scenario doesn't show her doing anything wrong. The problem lies with the boyfriend's persistence and disrespect for her limits.\n"
