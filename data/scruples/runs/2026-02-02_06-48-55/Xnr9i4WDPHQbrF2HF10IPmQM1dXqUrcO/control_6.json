I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially because of a past negative experience. That seems important\u2014setting boundaries early is key in any relationship. The boyfriend, however, keeps pushing despite those clear boundaries. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and bringing up the fact that they haven't tried it together yet. That sounds like he's dismissing her autonomy and past experiences.\n\nThe boyfriend called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. That's not respectful. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If someone keeps pressuring a partner after those boundaries are set, that's a problem. The author is standing by her decision, which is her right. She's considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing issue, which might indicate that the boyfriend isn't respecting her enough to let that boundary stand.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: clear communication of boundaries, the other partner not respecting those boundaries, and the pressure tactics used. None of these actions suggest the author is at fault. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here. He's not respecting her limits, which is a red flag. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary and not wanting to engage in an activity that causes her discomfort or pain.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions of persistently pushing the boundary and not respecting her past experience are the issues here.\n"
