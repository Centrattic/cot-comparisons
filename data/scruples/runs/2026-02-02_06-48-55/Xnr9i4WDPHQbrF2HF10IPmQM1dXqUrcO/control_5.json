I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a deal-breaker for the author. \n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary early in the relationship. They mentioned a bad experience where anal sex was forced, which caused pain and they had to stop. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing despite their refusal. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The author communicated their no-go area upfront. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary and is pressuring them. Even though the author is \"vanilla\" and the boyfriend is \"kinky,\" that doesn't mean the author has to comply with something they've explicitly said no to.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014continuing to push, using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me,\" and calling the author a prude\u2014is manipulative and dismissive of her boundaries. The author's refusal isn't just about being prudish; it's about past trauma and pain. The boyfriend isn't considering her feelings here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and are standing by them. The boyfriend is the one overstepping and not respecting her limits. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
