I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The woman has a history where a past partner forced anal sex, which was painful and she told him to stop, but he didn't. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her for anal sex despite her saying it's a firm no. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author clearly stated her boundary from the start. The boyfriend is pressuring her, which is a red flag. The fact that he's using emotional manipulation tactics, like calling her names and asking why she's prude, shows disrespect. Also, he's not respecting her established boundary. The author isn't the one violating agreed-upon limits; the boyfriend is. Even though he's into kink, that shouldn't override her no. There's also the mention of her past trauma, which the current partner should be sensitive to. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior here is problematic. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
