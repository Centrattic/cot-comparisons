I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's read through the details again.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. When they first started having sex, she told him that anal sex was a no-go for her. She even mentioned a past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, he keeps pressuring her to try anal again, despite her firm \"no.\" She's considered ending the relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basics of consent and boundaries. When someone sets a boundary and the other person respects it, that's healthy. But if the other person keeps pushing despite the boundary, that's a red flag. The author has clearly communicated her limit, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which seem like manipulative tactics to get her to change her mind. Pressuring someone after they've said no is not okay.\n\nAlso, there's a history of trauma here. She had a bad experience with anal sex before, and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend is acting dismissive of her past experience and not acknowledging her trauma. That's not supportive behavior. A healthy partner would be understanding and not push for things that are painful or make the other person uncomfortable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her a prude and an asshole is disrespectful. He should be validating her feelings and boundaries instead of shaming her for them. The author is in a situation where she's being pressured into something she's not comfortable with, which is a form of coercion. Coercion isn't consent, so the boyfriend is in the wrong here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
