I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker.\n\nFirst, the author sets a clear boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal is a no-go. He's already had a bad experience with it, where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. That's a red flag about past trauma or non-consensual behavior.\n\nNow, the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" That sounds like he's dismissing her boundaries and past experience. He even called her a prude and an asshole, which is disrespectful and not okay in a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if someone is pressuring them for something they clearly don't want. Consent is about respecting each other's limits. If he respects her boundaries, he wouldn't keep pushing. The fact that he's using guilt or persuasion tactics, not respecting her \"no,\" shows he's not being considerate.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries without pressure. The author isn't in the wrong here. She communicated her limits, and he's not respecting them, which is a bigger issue. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
