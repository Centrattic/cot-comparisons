I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring the author for anal sex, which she's clearly stated is a boundary. She mentions she's tried anal once before and it was a bad experience, leading to lasting trauma. She's communicated her boundaries, but he keeps pushing, even calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Communication is a big factor. The author did set clear boundaries from the start, so that's on her side. The boyfriend is respecting her initial refusal? Well, no, because he's continuing to push despite her saying no. The fact that he's using manipulation tactics like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and \"you haven't tried it with me\" suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. Also, the fact that he's called her a prude and an asshole shows a lack of respect and emotional manipulation.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The author isn't violating any boundaries; she's the one who's communicated her limits. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting them. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong) because she's upholding her boundaries and the boyfriend is the one violating them by pressuring her. The user might have thought she could be wrong if she's not open to trying new things, but in this case, she's had a bad experience and is clear about her limits. It's about consent and respecting boundaries, so the boyfriend is the one at fault here.\n"
