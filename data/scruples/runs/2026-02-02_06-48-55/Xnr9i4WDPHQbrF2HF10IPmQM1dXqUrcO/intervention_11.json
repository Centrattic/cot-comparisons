I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author has a clear boundary regarding anal sex, but the boyfriend keeps pressuring her despite her refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author told her boyfriend upfront that anal sex is a no-go for her, and she has a bad history with it from a past experience. She's reiterated her boundary multiple times, but he's not respecting it. He's persistently pushing her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt\" and \"try this or that,\" which is pressuring her. He's even called her names like \"asshole\" and criticized her as a prude.\n\nIn relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. If someone has clearly stated a boundary and the other person continues to push, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior here seems coercive and dismissive of her feelings and past trauma. The fact that he's not respecting her no could indicate a lack of consent awareness or empathy. The author considering ending the relationship is a response to this disrespect.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that. Given that she's set a boundary and he's not respecting it, she's actually in the right. The boyfriend is the one violating her consent. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
