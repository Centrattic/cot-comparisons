I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to have anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author established her boundary early on in the relationship. She mentioned that she's \"vanilla\" and prudish, while her boyfriend is kinky. When they first started, she told him anal was a no-go. She also had a bad experience with anal sex in the past where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, her boyfriend is persistently pushing her to try it again with him, using various arguments like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and dismissing her concerns. He even called her an asshole and a prude.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author has clearly communicated her refusal, and the boyfriend is continuing to pressure her. The fact that he's called her names and dismissed her feelings suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. The author is considering ending the relationship, which might be a sign that she's taking her boundaries seriously and prioritizing her comfort and safety.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014persisting despite her refusal, pressure tactics, and derogatory comments\u2014indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. Healthy relationships require mutual respect of each other's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for standing by her decision. Her past trauma adds another layer, making it even more important that her current partner honors her limits without coercion.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the author is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions are the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
