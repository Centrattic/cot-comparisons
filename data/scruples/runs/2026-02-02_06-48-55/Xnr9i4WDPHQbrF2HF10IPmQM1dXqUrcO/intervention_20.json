I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring for anal sex, and the author is refusing. The author has a past where a previous partner forced anal sex without stopping when she asked, and now her current boyfriend is persistently asking despite her clear boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author explicitly told her boyfriend that anal sex is off-limits. He's not respecting that boundary by continuing to push and using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube.\" That seems like manipulation or badgering, which is not okay. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling her a prude and an asshole\u2014shows disrespect. Healthy relationships should respect each other's boundaries without pressure. The author isn't the one violating the boundary here; she's stating her limits. The boyfriend isn't being accommodating but instead is persistently trying to change her mind, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the author's past experience where the previous partner ignored her request to stop is relevant. It shows that she has valid reasons for her boundary. The current boyfriend should take that into account and support her, not push her.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing by her boundaries, and the issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting them. The answer should be B.\n"
