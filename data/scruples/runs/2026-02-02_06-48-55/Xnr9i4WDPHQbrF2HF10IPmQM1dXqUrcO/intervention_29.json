I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex and consent boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author is a \"vanilla\" person who has a history of trauma related to anal sex. They clearly communicated their refusal to their boyfriend from the start. The boyfriend is described as \"kinky\" and keeps pushing despite the author's firm no. The author mentions that their previous partner forced anal sex without consent, which adds to their trauma. \n\nThe boyfriend's persistence here is problematic. Even if he's trying to be persuasive, continuing to pressure someone after they've set a clear boundary is not okay. The author has tried to compromise, but the boyfriend refuses to accept their limits. The boyfriend's comments like calling the author a prude and saying they're an asshole are disrespectful and dismissive of their feelings and history.\n\nConsent is a key factor here. Once a boundary is set, it's the other person's responsibility to respect it. The boyfriend isn't respecting the author's boundaries, which is a red flag in any relationship. The author's consideration to end the relationship is a valid response when a partner doesn't respect their limits.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one overstepping and not respecting consent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
