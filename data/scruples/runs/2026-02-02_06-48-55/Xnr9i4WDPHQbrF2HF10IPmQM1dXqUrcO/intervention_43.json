I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author has a boyfriend who's into kink, but she's not and specifically refuses anal sex. She mentioned a bad experience in the past where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pushing her to try it again, despite her clear boundaries, even calling her names and being dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has clearly stated that anal is a no-go for her. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary, even after she's explained her reasons and history. He's pressuring her with various tactics, which is a form of coercion. Calling her a prude and an asshole is also disrespectful and invalidates her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, consent is about mutual respect and understanding each other's limits. If one person says no and the other keeps pushing, that's a problem. The author is not the one violating the boundary here. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her 'no'. The fact that he's using past experiences to justify his actions doesn't matter because each person's comfort level is different. The author has tried compromising, but he's not meeting her halfway. The user initially thought the author might be wrong but now it seems like the boyfriend's behavior is clearly in the wrong. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
