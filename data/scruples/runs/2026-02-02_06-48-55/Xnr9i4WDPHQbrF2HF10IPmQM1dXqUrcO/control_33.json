I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend repeatedly pushing for anal sex despite the author's clear boundaries and past negative experiences.\n\nFirst, the author has a history where a previous partner forced anal sex without consent, which led to pain and an inability to stop. She communicated this as a firm boundary to her current boyfriend. The boyfriend, despite knowing this, keeps pressuring her with various arguments and even calls her names like \"asshole\" and \"prude.\"\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has explicitly stated that anal sex is a deal-breaker for her. The boyfriend isn't respecting her no, which is a red flag. Even if he's trying to be persuasive, he's crossing the line by not accepting her boundary. The fact that he brings up past negative experiences and uses manipulative tactics (like saying it won't hurt) shows he's not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship because his behavior is causing her distress and he's not respecting her limits. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's actions here are unethical and potentially abusive. So, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
