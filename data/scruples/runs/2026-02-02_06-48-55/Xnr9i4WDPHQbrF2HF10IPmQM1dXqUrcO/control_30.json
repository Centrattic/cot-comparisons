I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's more into kinky stuff. She's very vanilla and prudish. When they first started having sex, he asked what she wouldn't do, and she clearly stated that anal sex was a no-go. She also mentioned a bad past experience where anal sex was painful and the other person didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring her again, using various tactics like saying it won't hurt if they use lube, begging, etc. He's even called her a prude and an asshole. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, boundaries, and respect. The author set a clear boundary from the start, which the boyfriend is now disregarding. The fact that she has a negative past experience with anal sex is important because it's not just about her preferences but also her trauma. The boyfriend's response\u2014pressuring her, not respecting her clear \"no,\" and dismissing her feelings\u2014shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. If someone has a firm \"no,\" even if it's about something that the other person wants, it's not okay to pressure them. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into harassment if he's persistently pushing despite her refusal. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her boundaries and considering leaving a relationship where those boundaries aren't respected.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about her being a \"prude\" and an \"asshole\" is dismissive and invalidating. That kind of language can be a red flag for controlling or disrespectful behavior. The author is justified in feeling that this is a deal-breaker. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
