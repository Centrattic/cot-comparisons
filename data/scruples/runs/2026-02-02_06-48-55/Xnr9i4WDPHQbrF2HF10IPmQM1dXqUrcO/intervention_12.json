I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in a relationship.\n\nSo the author is a woman in a one-year relationship. She's described as vanilla and prudish, while her boyfriend is into kink. When they started having sex, she told him that anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience before where anal sex hurt and the other partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pushing her to try anal sex again, even after she's clearly said no. He uses phrases like \"it won't hurt with lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and called her a prude.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship and is asking if she's the asshole. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries in a sexual relationship. If someone has clearly stated a boundary and the other person keeps pressuring them despite that, that's a problem. The key here is consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her \"no,\" which is a red flag. He's also bringing up past trauma (the previous experience where she was hurt and the partner didn't stop), which is a valid reason for her current boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014continuing to push, not respecting her refusal, and making derogatory comments\u2014suggest that he's the one in the wrong. The author has communicated her limits, and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. Even if he thinks there's a way to make it work, he shouldn't pressure her. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but that might be a common misconception where some people think if you're in a relationship, you have to be open to all sexual acts. However, consent is about mutual agreement, and boundaries must be respected. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
