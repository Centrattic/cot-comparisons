I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary upfront. They told the boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go and mentioned a bad past experience. The boyfriend didn't respect that boundary and kept pushing, even after being told it's a firm no. He used manipulative tactics, like minimizing the pain by mentioning lube, and called the author a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is essential. The boyfriend's behavior sounds controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings. The fact that he pushed despite her past trauma is concerning. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and standing by them. The boyfriend's refusal to accept her limits is the issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
