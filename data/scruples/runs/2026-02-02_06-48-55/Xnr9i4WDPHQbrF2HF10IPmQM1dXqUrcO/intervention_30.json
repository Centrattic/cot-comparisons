I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's described as \"kinky,\" while the author is \"vanilla\" and \"prudish.\" The key issue here is anal sex. The author has clearly stated that anal sex is a firm no for them, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when asked. The boyfriend, on the other hand, keeps pressuring them to try it again, using various arguments like using lube, saying it won't hurt, and even bringing up that they haven't tried it together. The author feels that the boyfriend isn't respecting their boundary, and the boyfriend calls them an asshole and a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship and asks if they're the asshole.\n\nThe user who posted this thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author has communicated their boundary clearly. They mentioned they tried anal sex once before, it was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when asked, which is a red flag. Now their current boyfriend is pressuring them, despite their clear refusal. The boyfriend's behavior here seems to be persistent pressure, which could be a form of coercion. The author is standing by their boundary, which is their right. The boyfriend's actions might be crossing into disrespecting boundaries, especially if he's not willing to accept \"no\" as an answer and is using guilt-tripping tactics (\"you've never tried it with me\").\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author has already communicated their no, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Pressure in relationships, especially regarding sexual activities, can be a sign of disrespect. The boyfriend's actions of calling the author names and being dismissive (\"why are you such a prude\") are not helpful and could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings and experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's side is about maintaining their personal boundaries and safety, especially given a past traumatic experience. It's important in relationships that both partners respect each other's limits. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship suggests that they feel the boyfriend isn't respecting them, which is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's insistence on anal sex despite the author's firm no could be seen as a violation of consent. Consent requires that all parties agree to the activity without pressure. If the author is not willing and the boyfriend keeps pushing, that's a problem. The boyfriend's arguments like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" might be minimizing the author's valid concerns, especially since they've already had a bad experience.\n\nAnother angle is the kink vs. vanilla dynamic. In such relationships, it's crucial that the vanilla partner's boundaries are respected. The kink partner should work within those boundaries to find mutually satisfying activities. If the kink partner cannot respect those boundaries, it's a sign of potential issues in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for maintaining their boundary and considering ending the relationship if the boyfriend doesn't stop pressuring them. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, as he's not respecting consent and boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
