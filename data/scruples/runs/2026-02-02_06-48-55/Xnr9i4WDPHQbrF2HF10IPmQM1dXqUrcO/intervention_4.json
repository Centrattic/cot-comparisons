I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go for them. They had a conversation with their boyfriend early on, setting that boundary. The boyfriend, however, isn't respecting that. He's pressuring her, using phrases like \"please,\" \"it won't hurt,\" and even calling her a prude. The author has a bad history with anal sex from a past partner who didn't stop when she asked, which adds to her trauma or discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author set a clear boundary, and the boyfriend is pushing against it. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is essential. If one person isn't respecting the other's limits, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's actions, like not stopping when she asked in the past and now pressuring her again, suggest he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong, but based on the information, it seems like the boyfriend is the one in the wrong. The author has every right to have her boundaries honored. The fact that the boyfriend is using emotional manipulation (\"you've never tried it with me\") and even calling her names (\"asshole\") indicates a lack of respect. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The author is justified in her stance and considering ending the relationship if her boundaries aren't respected. There's no indication that she's being unreasonable; she's standing up for her comfort and past experiences. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
