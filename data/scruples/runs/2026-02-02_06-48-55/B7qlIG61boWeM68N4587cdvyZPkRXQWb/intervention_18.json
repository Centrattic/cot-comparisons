Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a Valentine's Day date that went south due to the girlfriend getting very drunk, leading to a fight and the author considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a special, expensive date to celebrate Valentine's Day. They adjusted their work schedule to spend time with their partner, which shows effort. The girlfriend, however, drank alcohol multiple times before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to enjoy the events they had planned. The author tried to accommodate her (like waiting for her to nap), but ultimately left the show because she couldn't attend. The fight happened when she accused the author of ruining the date, and he got angry, sarcastically blaming her for the wasted money and time.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they did make an effort to plan the date and tried to handle the situation by waiting for her to sober up. However, when she continued to act out of control and blamed him, his frustration led to yelling. The key points are whether getting drunk to the point of ruining a date is her responsibility, and if the author overreacted by leaving the show and then getting angry.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior involved making decisions that directly impacted the date's success. She chose to drink despite being warned, leading to her being too intoxicated to participate. The author might feel wronged because their plans were ruined by her actions. However, the author did leave the show, which could be seen as abandoning her, but given the context, maybe justified if she was beyond helping.\n\nThe author's anger and sarcastic remarks are problematic. Yelling and sarcastic comments, even when upset, can escalate conflicts. However, given the circumstances of the ruined plans and the girlfriend's blame, his reaction might be understandable, though not ideal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend made choices that led to the date's failure, but the author's response could also be seen as harsh. Moving out and calling it a waste of time might be excessive, but the root cause is her actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is her getting drunk and ruining the date, but he also reacted poorly, it's a mix. However, typically, if someone makes decisions that directly impact a shared plan, they bear responsibility. The author's reaction, while not ideal, might be a result of frustration from her actions. So, the answer might hinge on whose actions were more at fault. Since the girlfriend's choices led to the situation, the author might not be the asshole. But his reaction could still be seen as contributing. However, in the context of the situation, maybe he's justified in feeling wronged.\n"
