Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight and a possible breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, adjusted his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with friends before they met up. He mentions being annoyed that she's tipsy because once she gets a buzz, she can't stop. He tried to plan a nice date with a fancy restaurant and a show. \n\nAt the restaurant, she continued drinking despite his concerns, leading to her slurring words. Then, at the show, she passed out and he left, which she later blamed him for. The argument escalated, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author tried to accommodate her and planned a special day. She drank alcohol despite his concerns, leading to the date not going as planned. He left the show because she wasn't there, which she claims he promised to wait for. He's upset about the money and time spent. \n\nBut did he handle it correctly? He asked her if drinking was okay, and she said it was. He might have a right to be upset that she didn't follow through with the plans. However, maybe he could have communicated better or set boundaries earlier. For example, if she was already drunk, perhaps he should have addressed it before the show, maybe not let her drink more. Also, leaving the show without her might have been a mistake, but he didn't want to sit alone. \n\nOn her part, she drank despite knowing the plans, and then blamed him for leaving. The argument about who's at fault might come down to communication and mutual respect. If she was going to get drunk, maybe she should have considered how it would affect the date. However, the author also might have a responsibility to ensure she doesn't overindulge, especially if he knows her tendencies. \n\nBut in terms of the question, the author is asking if he's the asshole. The key points are that he planned a special day, she didn't follow through, leading to the date being ruined. He's frustrated about the money and time. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like not letting her drink more in the car or setting limits earlier. \n\nIn many relationships, both parties have some responsibility. If she got too drunk, she's responsible, but the author might have a duty to prevent her from getting to that point. However, if he allowed her to drink more in the car despite his concerns, that's a point against him. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but maybe the answer is no. The author tried to accommodate her, expressed concerns, but she ignored them. So he's not necessarily at fault. The fight was over her actions, not his. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if he could have done more to prevent her from getting drunk, then maybe A. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he planned the date, expressed concerns, and she didn't listen, leading to the problem, he's not the one at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
