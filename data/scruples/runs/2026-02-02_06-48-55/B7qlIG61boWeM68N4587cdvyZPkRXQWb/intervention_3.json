Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got drunk. \n\nFirst, the author planned a special evening, rearranged work to have time together. The girlfriend was already tipsy when he arrived home, and she brought more beer in the car. At the restaurant, she was slurring words and ordered more cocktails. Then, they were supposed to go to a show, but she passed out and he left her in the car, heading home. She later accused him of ruining the date and now wants him to move out.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. Let me break it down. The girlfriend's actions: showing up drunk when an expensive date was planned. She might be irresponsible or not respecting the occasion. The author tried to be understanding, even after she drank more in the car. When she couldn't attend the show, he left. But he did mention he didn't want to sit alone, especially with VIP tickets. Is it his fault for not preventing her from getting drunk? Did he do enough to make her stop drinking? He asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea, and she insisted. So maybe he's not entirely to blame here. \n\nBut then, when she was passed out, he left her in the car. Is that a problem? If she was still conscious enough to tell him to fuck off, maybe she was being rude. However, the author's main issue was that she was too drunk to enjoy the show, and he decided to leave. The cost of the tickets was a factor, but the main problem was the missed experience. \n\nHe got angry and sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time. Sarcastic remarks might have been uncalled for, especially when she was drunk. But she was the one who initiated by blaming him. The conflict escalated, and maybe he overreacted. However, she then kicked him out of bed and told him to move out. \n\nSo, the key points: She got drunk despite the plans, he tried to reason with her, left when she couldn't attend the show, and got angry when she accused him. He's considering moving out, but the question is if he's the asshole. \n\nIf the girlfriend was aware of the plans and still chose to drink excessively, she might be at fault. The author made an effort to accommodate her (changing work schedule), but she didn't respect his efforts. However, his reaction of sarcasm and anger might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe justified. The final action of her wanting him to move out seems extreme if he was just trying to salvage the date. \n\nI think the girlfriend is more at fault here. The author tried to be understanding, but she didn't listen. He left when the situation was unmanageable and expressed frustration. The answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The sarcastic comment could be seen as dismissive, but she was being uncooperative. Also, leaving her in the car after she was passed out might be harsh, but if she was too drunk to enjoy the show, maybe it was the right call. \n\nSo overall, the author made a tough decision but tried to be accommodating. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
