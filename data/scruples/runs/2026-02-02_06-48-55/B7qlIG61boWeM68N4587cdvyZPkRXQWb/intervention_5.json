Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got really drunk and ruined the plans. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The guy moved his work schedule to have the day off for Valentine's, which shows he put effort into making it special. The girlfriend was meeting a friend at the bar before they left, which the author mentions he's a bit annoyed about because once she gets buzzed, she tends to get wasted. He planned a nice dinner at an expensive restaurant and a show. But she kept drinking more beer in the car and then ordered more cocktails at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. At the show, she passed out and he left, which caused a fight later.\n\nThe author is upset because he spent a lot of money and time planning the date, and she didn't follow through. He's frustrated that she kept drinking despite his concerns and that she blamed him for ruining the date. He even sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time. Then she kicked him out and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. He did ask her if it was a good idea for her to drink more, and she said it was fine. So he followed her lead. But maybe he could have been more assertive in stopping her from drinking if he knew she couldn't control herself. However, the girlfriend was the one who chose to drink beyond her limits, knowing the plans. She might be responsible for her actions. The author tried to accommodate her, even when she was drunk, but she still complained and blamed him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation better when she was passed out. Leaving the show alone might not be the best choice, but he had paid for VIP tickets and didn't want to sit alone. The fight at the end was heated, and he expressed his frustration, which might have been harsh. But given the circumstances, some might see it as justified given the wasted money and effort.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The girlfriend's actions directly led to the ruined date, but the author's reaction might have escalated the conflict. It's possible that both are at fault to some extent. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did follow her lead when she assured him she was okay to drink, and he made an effort to make the date special, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But he could have done more to prevent her from over-drinking or handled the situation more calmly when she was unresponsive. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's responsibility is to respect his efforts and not sabotage the date by overindulging. The author might not be in the wrong here because he tried to accommodate her, but his sarcastic remarks and leaving the show alone could be seen as harsh. However, considering the girlfriend's behavior, some might argue he's justified in his frustration.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the key points are: Did the author do something wrong? He asked her if drinking was a good idea and she said yes. He tried to go along with the date despite her being drunk. When she passed out, he left because sitting alone was not enjoyable. The fight was about her blaming him, which is unfair. So maybe the author is not the asshole here. His actions were a result of her choices. But maybe he should have set clearer boundaries earlier to prevent her from drinking so much. However, the girlfriend is clearly responsible for her own decisions. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
