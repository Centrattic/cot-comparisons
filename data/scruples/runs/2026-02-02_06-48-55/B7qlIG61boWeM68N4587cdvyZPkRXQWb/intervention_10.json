Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is a Valentine's Day date that ended in a fight, with the girlfriend getting very drunk and the author leaving the show early.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, moved their work schedule to spend time with their partner. The girlfriend went to the bar with friends before the date. The author seemed concerned about her drinking because they had a nice dinner and a show planned. She drank more during the drive and at the restaurant, leading to her being too drunk for the show. The author left the show alone because they didn't want to sit there by themselves with an empty seat. The girlfriend later accused the author of ruining the date, leading to a fight and the threat to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author tried to plan a nice date, adjusted their schedule, and tried to accommodate the girlfriend's drinking despite concerns. The girlfriend's actions led to them not being able to enjoy the planned activities. The author left the show because they didn't want to sit alone, which is understandable. But maybe the author should have handled the situation differently, like staying to use the tickets or addressing the drinking issue earlier. However, the girlfriend's behavior was the main cause of the problem. The author's frustration is valid given the effort and money spent. The girlfriend's response of blaming him and wanting him to move out seems harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have taken steps earlier to prevent her from getting so drunk, like setting boundaries before the date. But since she insisted on drinking and he asked her before bringing more beer, maybe he did what he could. The decision to leave the show alone was his choice, but it's a valid personal preference. The fight and the girlfriend's reaction might be more about her handling the situation than his actions. Considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue was the girlfriend's excessive drinking and her reaction, not the author's decision to leave the show. So the answer should be B.\n"
