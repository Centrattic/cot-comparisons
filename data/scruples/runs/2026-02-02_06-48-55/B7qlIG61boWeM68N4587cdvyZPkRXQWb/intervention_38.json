Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got really drunk. The author planned a special day with a fancy dinner and a show. The girlfriend started drinking before they left, continued in the car, and then at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and passed out, so the author left early. They had a big fight afterward, and she wants him to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author moved his work schedule to spend the day with her, which shows he put effort into the date. He was concerned about her drinking and asked her if it was a good idea, but she insisted. When she became too drunk to enjoy the show, he left because he didn't want to sit alone. He was upset because of the money and time spent, and he snapped during the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. She ignored his concerns about drinking and ended up too intoxicated to participate in the plans. However, the author could have tried to handle the situation differently. Maybe he could have been more patient, tried to talk her out of drinking more, or found a way to make the show work even if she was drunk. Leaving in the middle might have been a hasty decision, especially since they had paid for tickets. Also, during the argument, his sarcastic remark about the money and time could have been hurtful and contributed to the fight.\n\nBut the author did try to act like everything was fine during the date despite her being drunk. He also made an effort to adjust his work schedule for the occasion. However, his frustration led to yelling and sarcastic comments, which isn't ideal. The girlfriend's behavior was definitely a problem, but the author's reaction might have escalated the situation. \n\nI think the key points are whether the author had a right to be upset and if his response was justified. He was within his right to be frustrated, but maybe he could have communicated better without yelling. However, the main issue was her excessive drinking, which he tried to warn her about. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. The girlfriend's actions were a bigger problem, but the author's response might have contributed to the fight. It's a bit of a gray area. If he left the show because he didn't want to go alone, that's understandable. But blowing up during the argument might be where he went wrong. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
