Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is the asshole here, which means determining if they're in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend had a Valentine's Day date that turned into a fight. The author adjusted their work schedule to be off, planning a special evening. The girlfriend was at a bar with friends earlier, and when the author arrives home, she's already tipsy. They were going to a fancy restaurant, but she brings more beer and drinks more in the car. The author tried to check if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she's slurring her words, orders more cocktails, and by the end is struggling to stand. The author proceeds with the date, but at the show, she's too drunk and passes out. The author leaves the show alone, and later the girlfriend blames the author for ruining the date. They argue, and the girlfriend wants the author to move out.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she got drunk multiple times during the date. She drank at the bar, then in the car, leading up to the expensive restaurant. She ended up slurring words and struggling to stand. Then, during the show, she was too drunk and passed out. The author tried to engage her but she was unresponsive. The author left the show alone because it wasn't fun without her.\n\nThe author's actions: They tried to accommodate her, even though they were annoyed. They let her drink in the car despite their concerns. They didn't stop her from drinking at the restaurant. Then, when she was too out of it for the show, they left. The argument later led to the breakup.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the girlfriend's decisions to drink heavily are her own responsibility. The author tried to respect her decisions when she said it was okay. However, maybe the author could have been more firm in not letting her drink further if they thought it was a problem. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior led to the date being compromised. The author didn't cause her to drink, but perhaps failed to set boundaries. The author left the show alone, which might be seen as abandoning the date, but the main issue is the girlfriend's excessive drinking. The argument seems to stem from her blaming the author for the failed date, which the author is frustrated about.\n\nConsidering all that, the main responsibility lies with the girlfriend for her choices. The author tried to manage the situation but ultimately left when the show wasn't feasible. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial and time investment. The girlfriend's actions ruined the date, and the author is not necessarily in the wrong for holding her accountable. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
