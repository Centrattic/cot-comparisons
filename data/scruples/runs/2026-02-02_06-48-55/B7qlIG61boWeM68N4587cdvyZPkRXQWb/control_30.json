Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, it's Valentine's Day, and the author rearranged his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. They had a planned date at an expensive restaurant followed by a show. The girlfriend went to a bar with her friend while the author was at work. She was already tipsy when he arrived home, then continued drinking on the drive to the restaurant. The author warned her about drinking, but she insisted it was okay. At the restaurant, she got more drinks, became slurred, and by the end was struggling to stand. The author tried to keep the date going but ended up leaving the show because she was too drunk and unresponsive. Then there was an argument, and she kicked him out, suggesting he move out.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author made an effort to plan a special date, adjusted his schedule, and tried to accommodate her despite her drinking. He did ask her if it was a good idea to drink, so he tried to communicate. She, on the other hand, chose to drink more despite his concerns, leading to the date being ruined. Her actions directly caused the problem. The author left the show because she wasn't participating, which might be seen as a reasonable decision given the circumstances. However, he did take her to the restaurant and tried to make the best of it. The fight resulted from her blaming him for the failed date, which seems unfair. \n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's decision to drink excessively despite the author's warnings, which led to the date's failure. The author's actions were reactive to her choices. While he could have handled the situation differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier, the primary responsibility lies with her for not respecting the plans. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
