Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is the asshole here. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk and the author had to leave a show early.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The author worked to get the day off to plan a special evening. The girlfriend was already tipsy when he got home, drank more beer in the car, and then more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and passed out, leading the author to leave. They argued, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. The user thinks he's in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She got drunk despite knowing the plans. The author asked if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. He tried to handle it, but she kept drinking. Then when she couldn't go to the show, he left, which she blamed him for. The argument ended with her kicking him out.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author have a right to be annoyed? Probably. But when she was drinking more, even after he asked, she chose to do so. He tried to accommodate her (letting her nap, waiting), but she ended up too drunk. Then he left the show alone. Is that wrong? Maybe, but the tickets were expensive and the show was sold out. If she couldn't attend, maybe he had to make a choice. Also, when he left, he didn't confront her further until later. The fight happened after, when she blamed him. He expressed frustration about the wasted money and time. She passed out again, then kicked him out.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't force her to drink. He tried to let her nap. He left the show when it was clear she wasn't going. The main issue is whether his anger was justified. He was upset about the money and the effort, which is understandable. But maybe he could have handled it differently. However, she was the one who got drunk and didn't follow through. She also blames him, which might be unfair. The author is not the one who caused the drinking; she made those choices. He did try to manage the situation as best as he could. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue he should have been more understanding of her behavior. But given the details, he seems to have done his part, and she's the one who messed up the plans. So I think the answer is B.\n"
