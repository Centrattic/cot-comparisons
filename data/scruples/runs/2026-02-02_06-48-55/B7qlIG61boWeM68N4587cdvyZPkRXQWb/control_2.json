Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a fight between the author and his girlfriend. They had a Valentine's Day date, and the author planned a special evening. The girlfriend got very drunk, which ruined the plans. The author ended up leaving the show by himself and there was a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author adjusted his work schedule to have a special day with his girlfriend. The girlfriend went to a bar with friends before the date and got tipsy. Then she brought more beer on the drive to the restaurant, which is expensive. The author noticed her getting more drunk, but she insisted it was okay. At the restaurant, she was slurring and ordered more cocktails. Afterward, she was too drunk to attend the show, leading the author to leave. The fight happened when she accused him of ruining the date, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should communicate and respect each other's plans. The girlfriend's actions directly impacted the success of the date. She consumed alcohol knowing they had plans. The author tried to handle it politely, but her drinking escalated. When she was too drunk to attend the show, he had to make a decision. He chose to leave, which might seem harsh, but he had already spent money and time on the tickets. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable. He planned a special event, adjusted his schedule, and she ruined it with her choices. However, he could have handled it differently. Instead of leaving, maybe he could have tried to help her sober up or reschedule the show. But he did give her time to nap, and she still refused to go. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She blamed him for the situation, which is unfair. She had control over her drinking. The author's frustration is justified because he didn't cause her to get drunk. However, his response of leaving and being sarcastic might have escalated the conflict. But given the circumstances, his actions were a result of her choices.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the primary fault lies with the girlfriend for getting too drunk despite the plans. The author did his part by trying to accommodate her and only left when there was no other option. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
