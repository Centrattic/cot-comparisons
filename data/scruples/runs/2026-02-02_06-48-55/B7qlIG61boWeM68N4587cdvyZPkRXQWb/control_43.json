Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight with his girlfriend after Valentine's Day plans went south because she got too drunk.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, adjusted his work schedule, and they went to an expensive restaurant and a show. The girlfriend drank alcohol before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author left the show alone, and later there was a fight where he expressed frustration about the wasted money and time. She blamed him and now wants him to move out.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author's actions: he tried to make things special, asked her if drinking was okay (she said it was), and when she was too drunk, he left the show. He got angry and sarcastically criticized her. She, on the other hand, drank despite his concerns, got very drunk, and blamed him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did plan the date and tried to accommodate her, but when she chose to drink, he asked her if it was okay. He also left the show after she was too drunk to attend, which might have been a mistake. But he was frustrated with the wasted money and time. His reaction was anger, but he had valid reasons. The girlfriend's actions led to the problem, but he might have handled it differently. \n\nHowever, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he followed through with the plans as much as possible, expressed his concerns, and only left when she was too drunk to participate, it's more about her actions. The author's anger, while maybe poorly expressed, stems from her choices. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't the asshole.\n"
