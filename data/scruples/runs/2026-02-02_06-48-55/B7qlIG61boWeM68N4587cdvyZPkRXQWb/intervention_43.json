Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend drank too much.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, rearranged his work schedule, and spent a lot of money. The girlfriend was already tipsy when she came home, and then drank more during the drive. At the restaurant, she got more drinks and was slurring. Then at the show, she passed out, leading the author to leave early. The fight escalated, and now the girlfriend wants him to move out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author tried to manage the situation, asked her if drinking was a good idea, and still went along with the plans. However, when she kept drinking and became a problem, he left the show alone. The girlfriend's behavior affected the date, but the author's decision to leave might be seen as selfish because they paid for VIP tickets and he didn't want to sit alone.\n\nBut wait, the author is also a participant in the relationship. Did he do enough to prevent her from getting so drunk? He asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea, which shows he tried to communicate. However, once she was already drunk, maybe he should have taken more steps to stop her drinking, like not letting her bring beer in the car or at the restaurant. But he respected her decisions even when they seemed bad, which could be seen as enabling.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. She didn't consider his plans and her behavior was inconsiderate. The author's anger is understandable given the financial and emotional investment. However, leaving the show without her, even if he felt it wasn't worth sitting alone, might not have been the best approach. Maybe he should have tried to stay and see if she could manage or at least communicate better.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual consideration. The author tried to accommodate her, but she didn't respect his plans. However, the author could have handled the situation more calmly, maybe by being more assertive in preventing her from drinking excessively once it started affecting their plans. The fact that he got angry and sarcastic might have contributed to the fight.\n\nIn terms of who is at fault, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were the main cause of the ruined date, but the author's reaction (leaving the show, sarcastic comments) might have worsened the situation. However, the girlfriend's text about wanting him to move out seems extreme if she's the one who caused the problem. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled things better. However, the initial judgment is whether he's the asshole. Given that he tried to accommodate her and the date was his idea, perhaps the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because both sides have issues. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because the main fault lies with the girlfriend, but there's nuance here.\n"
