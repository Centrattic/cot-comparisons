Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. \n\nFirst, the setup: It's Valentine's Day, and the author planned a special date. The girlfriend went to a bar with friends before the date, got tipsy, then continued drinking during the drive. The author was concerned but let her proceed. At the restaurant, she got more drinks and was visibly impaired. Then at the show, she passed out, and the author left early. The argument followed, and now the girlfriend wants the author to move out.\n\nThe author's actions: He tried to accommodate her by changing his work schedule. He warned her about the drinks but she insisted. When she became too drunk to attend the show, he left early to avoid wasting money. He expressed frustration but didn't yell, and he didn't push back when she asked him to move out.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author overreact? Was he reasonable to leave the show early given her state? Did he have a right to be upset about the wasted money and time? Did he handle the situation calmly, or was there escalation? Also, was the girlfriend's behavior unreasonable, and did the author support her or blame her?\n\nThe author tried to handle the situation with patience, even when she was slurring and needed to be woken up. He left the show to avoid sitting alone in a VIP section. His frustration was about the wasted money and time, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, wanting him to move out after an argument where he didn't escalate. The author might have been in the right to express his disappointment, but maybe not the wrong. He didn't force her to drink, and her actions led to the problem. So, probably the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
