Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got really drunk, leading to arguments and a possible breakup. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author planned a special date, rearranged their work schedule, and spent a significant amount of money. They wanted a nice evening together. The girlfriend, on the other hand, was drinking before the date, brought more beer in the car, and then got very drunk during dinner. She ended up not being able to attend the show they paid for, which was a big expense. The author felt frustrated and ended up yelling, leading to a fight.\n\nThe author's actions: They tried to accommodate her by changing their work schedule, made an effort to have a nice time, and even tried to go along when she was drunk. When she wasn't able to attend the show, they left and later lashed out. They did ask her if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was okay. But when she got drunk and they had to leave the show, the author left, then later confronted her and got angry.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She got drunk before the date, continued drinking during the car ride and dinner, leading to her being too drunk to enjoy the show. When the author left the show, she blamed him and later wanted him to move out.\n\nNow, considering responsibilities: The author planned the date with her in mind, but her drinking behavior ruined the plans. The author tried to handle it as best as they could but eventually lost their temper. The girlfriend's actions were the main reason the date didn't go as planned. However, the author did have a right to feel upset about the wasted money and time. But when they yelled and sarcastically thanked her, that might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did plan the date and tried to make it work despite her drinking. But when they left the show, maybe they should have tried to find another way to handle it instead of just leaving and then getting angry later. Also, yelling and sarcastic remarks can be seen as harsh, especially when she was drunk. However, the main issue was her actions leading to the date's failure. \n\nThe girlfriend's responsibility was to not get so drunk that it ruined their plans. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they could have handled the situation better. However, the core problem was her drinking. But the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the girlfriend was the one who got drunk and caused the issue, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author had a better way to handle the situation, perhaps they share some responsibility. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the main fault was the girlfriend's excessive drinking. The author tried to accommodate her, and while they did yell, the primary issue was her actions. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently. But given the situation, it's more the girlfriend's fault. So the answer is B.\n"
