Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple having a Valentine's Day date that went wrong due to the girlfriend's drinking.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, moved his work schedule, and had a nice dinner and a show planned. The girlfriend was drinking before the date, brought more beer in the car, and then ordered more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and passed out. The author left the show alone because he didn't want to sit there by himself. They ended up fighting when she blamed him for ruining the date.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's actions definitely contributed to the problems\u2014drinking excessively, being difficult to wake up, and blaming the author. However, the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe he could have set boundaries earlier, like not letting her bring beer in the car or not proceeding with the restaurant if she was already too drunk. Also, when she was passed out, maybe he could have tried to get her to attend the show later or find another plan instead of leaving and making her feel abandoned. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author was planning a special occasion and might have been frustrated with the girlfriend's behavior. He tried to accommodate her by adjusting his work schedule and making a big effort. However, when she was too drunk to participate, he left the show, which could be seen as selfish because he didn't consider her state. Also, the way he expressed his frustration by yelling and being sarcastic might be part of the issue.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might have some responsibility for not addressing her drinking earlier, but the main issue is the girlfriend's excessive drinking and her blaming him. The author's decision to leave the show might have been a reaction to her behavior, but he could have found another solution. However, the girlfriend's actions were the primary cause of the date going wrong. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but perhaps he shares some responsibility. Given the options, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the main fault lies with the girlfriend's choices, and the author did make efforts to accommodate her. The fact that she blamed him despite her own actions is a significant point.\n"
