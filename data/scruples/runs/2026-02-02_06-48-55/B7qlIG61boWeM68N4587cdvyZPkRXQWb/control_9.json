Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the author ending the date early and her asking him to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author worked to adjust his schedule to have a special day with his girlfriend. She was already tipsy when he got home, and then continued drinking more in the car. They went to an expensive restaurant, which ended up costing $240, and she insisted on more cocktails. Then, at the show, she passed out and was unresponsive, so he left because he didn't want to waste the VIP tickets alone. He got angry when she blamed him for ruining the date, leading to a fight and her kicking him out.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are consent, communication, and responsibility. The girlfriend was getting drunk and acting out, which might affect her ability to make decisions. The author did express concerns before she drank more in the car, but she reassured him. However, once she was too drunk to attend the show, he left, which she later claims he promised he wouldn't do. The author is questioning if he's the asshole by ending the date early due to her intoxication.\n\nI should think about whether the author had a responsibility to stay despite her being drunk, or if her actions made the date unenjoyable. Also, the fact that she was drinking excessively and then blamed him. The author's frustration is understandable because he planned a special day and she ruined it by overindulging. But was it wrong for him to leave when she was clearly not in a state to participate? \n\nIn terms of communication, maybe there was a misunderstanding about her \"told me\" she would follow him in after napping. If that didn't happen, maybe she's misremembering due to being drunk. The author acting like everything was fine at the restaurant but then having to leave early because she was too drunk shows he tried to accommodate her. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to be the bigger issue here. She went against what they had planned by continuing to drink, leading to the date being cut short. The author's reaction might be justified as he was trying to protect the experience they both wanted. Ending the date and getting angry is a response to her actions, which caused the problem. \n\nBut also, did the author have to leave the show immediately? Maybe he could have waited longer or tried other solutions. However, given the context of VIP tickets and a sold-out show, he might have felt it was a lost opportunity. The girlfriend's insistence on drinking more despite his concerns could be seen as dismissive. \n\nLeaving when she was unresponsive might be necessary to avoid a dangerous situation, but the key is whether he handled it appropriately. If he left her in the car and she was still conscious enough to nap and have a drink, then perhaps he should have considered her safety more. However, the main issue is her excessive drinking leading to the date's failure. \n\nThe final act of her kicking him out and him considering moving out is a significant consequence, but the question is about who is in the wrong here. The author's actions were a response to her causing the problem by being over-drunk. So, the answer is likely B (No), because the girlfriend's behavior was the main cause of the date's issues, and the author acted to salvage the situation as best he could.\n"
