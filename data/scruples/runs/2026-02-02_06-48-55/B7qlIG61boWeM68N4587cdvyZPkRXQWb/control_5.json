Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the date being cut short and a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date, moved their work schedule to be with their girlfriend. The girlfriend was already drinking before the date started, then continued during the drive and at the restaurant. She ended up too drunk to attend the show, which the author left because they didn't want to sit alone. The girlfriend later accused the author of ruining the date, leading to a fight where the author expressed frustration about the wasted money and time. Now the girlfriend wants the author to move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Planning a Special Date**: The author went out of their way to adjust their work schedule for the date, showing they wanted to make it special. The restaurant was expensive, indicating it was important to them both. The girlfriend's drinking seems to have disrupted this plan.\n\n2. **Girlfriend's Behavior**: The girlfriend started drinking before the date, continued while driving (though she was the one drinking, not the driver, but maybe she was in the car?), and ended up too intoxicated to attend the show. The author tried to manage the situation by letting her nap, but when she didn't wake up, he left. The girlfriend's actions led to the date being cut short, which is her responsibility.\n\n3. **Author's Reaction**: The author handled the situation by leaving the show when it became clear she couldn't attend. He expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which is understandable. However, the sarcastic comment about the cost might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to the situation. The fight escalated when the girlfriend blamed him for ruining the date, which wasn't his fault.\n\n4. **Communication Issues**: The author might have tried to communicate his concerns earlier. For example, when she started drinking in the car or at the restaurant, he could have been more direct about his concerns instead of letting it escalate. But given that she reassured him each time, maybe he did his part to warn her.\n\n5. **Blame and Responsibility**: The main issue seems to be that the girlfriend chose to get drunk despite knowing the plans. The author tried to accommodate her as much as possible but ultimately left when it was no longer feasible. The girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out seems extreme, possibly due to her own guilt or frustration. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, the girlfriend's decisions led to the date failing. The author tried to handle things with patience but had to make a practical decision. His frustration is justified given the financial and time investment. However, his sarcastic remark might have been unkind, but the core issue is the girlfriend's actions. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong (B). The main responsibility lies with the girlfriend for her choices that ruined the date. The author made reasonable decisions given the circumstances.\n"
