Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author planned a special Valentine's Day date, moved his work schedule to have the day off, and wanted to spend time with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with her friend while he was at work, got tipsy, then brought more beer on the drive to the restaurant. The author was annoyed but let it go. At the restaurant, she slurried her words and ordered more cocktails, leading to her struggling to stand. Then at the show, she passed out and he left, leading to a fight and her wanting him to move out.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's actions: she got drunk, ignored his concerns, and then blamed him. The author tried to accommodate her despite her drinking, ended up spending a lot of money and time, and then got angry when the date fell apart. \n\nPossible angles: The author might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate his boundaries or if he shouldn't have let her drink more despite his concerns. On the other hand, she was the one who was drunk and caused the problems, and he had to cancel the show. \n\nBut wait, the author did ask her if it was a good idea to drink, and she said it was fine. That might mean she's responsible for her own actions. He tried to manage the situation, but when she was too drunk to attend the show, he had to make a decision. Leaving might have been the only option, and his frustration is understandable. \n\nHowever, his sarcastic comment about wasting money and time might be seen as harsh. Also, the girlfriend's reaction of asking him to move out seems extreme. But maybe the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who causes the problem is the one at fault. Here, the girlfriend's drinking led to the date being ruined. The author tried to handle it, but she was the one who made choices that messed up their plans. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nBut some might argue that he should have been more proactive in stopping her from drinking. However, he did ask her, and she insisted. So he might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
