Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, rearranged their work schedule to be off, and wanted a romantic evening. The girlfriend was at a bar with friends before they left, got tipsy, and then drank more during the drive and at the restaurant. The author tried to be understanding but was annoyed. At the restaurant, she got more drinks and was struggling by the end. Then, at the show, she passed out and the author left, leading to an argument.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author made efforts to plan something special and seems to have been patient, even when she was drinking. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014drinking despite warnings, then being unresponsive\u2014led to the plan falling apart. The author left the show alone because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP seats, which is understandable. The argument happened when he got home, and she blamed him, leading to them fighting.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he tried to accommodate her, asked if she was sure about drinking, and even gave her time to nap. She ignored his concerns and her actions caused the date to be ruined. The author was frustrated and ended up yelling, but the main issue was her excessive drinking. He didn't force her to drink; she made those choices. So the blame seems more on her side. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like not going to the show or setting clearer boundaries earlier. But given the situation, he did what he could. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
