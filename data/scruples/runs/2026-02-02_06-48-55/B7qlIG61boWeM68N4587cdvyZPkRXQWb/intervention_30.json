Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight between a couple on Valentine's Day where the girlfriend got very drunk and they ended up not being able to enjoy their planned activities. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The guy moved his work schedule to have a special day with his girlfriend. He planned a nice dinner and a show. The girlfriend was at the bar before he arrived home, got tipsy, then brought more beer. He asked her a couple of times if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she started slurring her words, ordered more cocktails, and by the end was struggling to stand. Then at the show, she passed out. He tried to wake her, she told him to fuck off, so he left. She later accused him of leaving without her, leading to a fight, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Let's look at their actions. The author did plan the day, but the girlfriend chose to drink heavily despite knowing the plans. He did ask her multiple times if she was okay, which shows he tried to communicate. However, when she refused to go into the show and passed out, he left. He might have felt that after her behavior, it wasn't worth waiting anymore. But was he supposed to stay and wait for her indefinitely? Also, the girlfriend's actions led to them not being able to enjoy the activities they planned. She was the one who got drunk, which is a choice, and her reaction to him leaving might be a result of her own actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled things differently. Maybe he could have tried to get her to drink more slowly, or insisted she not drink at all. But he did ask her a couple of times, so he made an effort. The girlfriend's decision to drink heavily could be a personal responsibility issue. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after spending money and time on the plans. When she blames him for ruining the date, that's unfair because her actions directly caused the problem. However, his response of blowing up at her and sarcastically thanking her might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Maybe he could have been more patient, but given the circumstances, his anger is somewhat justified.\n\nBut then, when she passed out and he tried to wake her, she was uncooperative. He gave her 15 minutes, then left. That seems reasonable. The problem is that she later claims he didn't go in first, but he says that conversation didn't happen. So there's a communication breakdown. The author might have made a mistake by leaving the show without her, but considering the tickets were expensive and the event was sold out, he was left with a bad situation. If he had stayed, maybe they could have used the tickets, but if she was completely out, it's not his fault she chose to drink.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's choices led to the problem. However, the author could have set clearer boundaries from the start, like not allowing alcohol if they had a big event planned. But he did ask her, so he tried. The key point is that the girlfriend's actions were the main issue here. The author is not at fault for leaving when she wasn't responsive. The blame is more on her for getting drunk and not respecting the plans. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong), because the main issue was her choices, and he made reasonable attempts to handle the situation.\n"
