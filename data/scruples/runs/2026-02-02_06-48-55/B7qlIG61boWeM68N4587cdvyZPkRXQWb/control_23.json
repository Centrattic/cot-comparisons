Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple had a Valentine's Day date. The author adjusted his work schedule to make sure they could have a day together. He mentions that his girlfriend was at the bar with a friend when he was leaving work. When he got home, she was tipsy. He's annoyed because once she gets drunk, it's hard to stop her, and they have a nice date planned. \n\nThen, on the drive to the restaurant, she brings more beer and drinks. He asks her a couple of times if that's a good idea, and she says it's fine. They end up at an expensive restaurant, and she orders two more cocktails there. By the end, she's struggling to stand. The author acts like everything is okay but then they go to a show. She passes out in the car and tells him to fuck off. He waits 15 minutes, tries again, but she's still out. The tickets cost $100 for VIP seats, and he leaves. \n\nOn the way home, she accuses him of leaving without her, even though he didn't. He gets angry, calls her out, and they fight. She blames him, they argue, and she kicks him out, tells him to move out. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? The author tried to plan a special date. He made sacrifices (changing work schedule) to make it happen. He warned her about drinking before the restaurant and in the car. She ignored his warnings, got very drunk, leading to them not being able to attend the show. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP. \n\nIs he wrong for leaving? Well, he paid for the tickets. She was too drunk to attend, so he left. Maybe he should have tried to make her stay, but she was unresponsive. He tried to wake her up twice. The show was important, and it was sold out with VIP seats. He didn't want to sit there alone. \n\nOn the other hand, she got drunk despite his warnings. She was irresponsible, and maybe she should have considered his efforts. But the author also could have been more insistent or maybe stopped her from drinking more. However, she didn't listen to his initial warnings. \n\nWhen he got angry, he sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time. That might have been harsh, but he was upset. She blamed him and kicked him out. \n\nI think the main issue is her getting drunk and ruining the plans despite his efforts. The author made a reasonable effort to plan the date and warned her. She was the one who overstepped. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
