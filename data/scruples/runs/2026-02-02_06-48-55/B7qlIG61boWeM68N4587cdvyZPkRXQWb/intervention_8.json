Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author planned a special evening, moved his work schedule, and they went to an expensive restaurant followed by a show. But the girlfriend kept drinking, got too drunk, and they ended up not attending the show. The fight happened because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that the girlfriend was already tipsy when she came home from the bar with her friend. He was annoyed because she tends to get wasted once she starts. Then, she brought more beer in the car, and he asked if it was okay, but she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails and ended up too drunk. By the time they got to the show, she was passed out and wouldn't go in, leading him to leave and drive home. The fight happened later when she blamed him for ruining the date.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Did he do anything wrong? Well, he planned the date, adjusted his schedule, and tried to accommodate her. He asked her if she thought drinking more was a good idea, and she said yes. He might have a right to be upset that she ignored his concerns and ruined the plans. But maybe there's something he could have done differently. For example, he could have refused to let her drink more, or maybe left earlier if she was too drunk. Did he have a responsibility to stop her from drinking, even if she insisted it was okay?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were clearly problematic. She got herself too drunk, wasted money on the show, and blamed him. But the author might have contributed by not setting boundaries. If he knew she tends to get wasted, maybe he should have been more proactive in preventing her from drinking too much instead of just asking a couple of times. However, he did communicate his concerns, and she dismissed them. \n\nAnother angle: the cost. The date was expensive, and they couldn't attend the show. The author is frustrated because of the wasted money and time. The girlfriend's actions led to that. But the author could have been more understanding, maybe? Or was he justified in being upset?\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author is responsible for her drinking. Since he asked her if it was okay and she said yes, maybe he isn't at fault. However, if he knew her tendency to overindulge, maybe he should have taken a stand. But in the situation, he tried to warn her, and she ignored him. So the responsibility is more on her. The author's frustration is understandable. He might not be in the wrong here. So probably answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
