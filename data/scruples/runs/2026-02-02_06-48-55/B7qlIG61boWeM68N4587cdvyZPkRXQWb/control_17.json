Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got really drunk. The author planned a special day, including a fancy dinner and a show, but the girlfriend drank a lot, got slurred speech, and eventually passed out. The author felt frustrated, left the show alone, and they had a big fight afterward.\n\nFirst, the author moved their work schedule to be off for the weekend to spend time with her. That shows effort on their part. The girlfriend went to a bar with a friend before they left, then brought more beer in the car. The author asked her if it was a good idea to drink, and she said it was fine. So she was the one choosing to consume alcohol even after being asked about it. \n\nAt the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more cocktails. Then, at the show, she passed out, the author tried to wake her, and she was unresponsive. The author ended up leaving the show because it wasn't worth waiting for her, and she later blamed him for ruining the date. The author was angry and sarcastic about the wasted money and time. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are responsibilities in a relationship. The girlfriend made choices to drink despite knowing they had a special plan. The author tried to accommodate her by adjusting his work, but she ignored his concerns about her drinking. When she got too drunk to attend the show, he left, which cost them money. However, he was also upset and maybe could have handled it differently, like waiting longer or trying to help her more. \n\nBut the main issue seems to be her actions leading to the date being ruined. The author did express his concerns before the drinking escalated. He tried to wake her up multiple times and gave her chances. Leaving the show alone might not be fair, but he did pay for the tickets and didn't want to sit there alone. \n\nThe fight that followed where he sarcastically thanked her and mentioned the costs might have been harsh, but the root cause was her choices. However, the girlfriend's response of wanting to move out might be an overreaction. \n\nOverall, the author tried to manage the situation, but the girlfriend's actions led to the problems. The author isn't in the wrong because he can't be responsible for her decisions once he's made his concerns known. He had the right to be upset about the wasted money and effort. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
