Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got too drunk, leading to a fight and them possibly breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule to be with his girlfriend. She went to the bar with a friend before he arrived home. He's annoyed because she tends to get wasted when she's tipsy. They went to an expensive restaurant, and she drank more there, leading to slurred speech. Then the burlesque show: she passed out, wouldn't go, so he left. They ended up fighting, she blames him, and she wants to break up.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, from the author's side: He made an effort to change his schedule for a special day. He tried to manage the situation when she was drinking, even though she insisted on more. He paid for the restaurant and the show, and ended up leaving the show alone because she wouldn't go. He got angry and sarcastic, which led to the argument.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She drank despite his concerns, got too drunk, and then blamed him for the ruined date. She wanted to nap and didn't want to go to the show, but later accused him of not waiting. She kicked him out and wants to break up.\n\nNow, considering the question of who is in the wrong. The author is upset because she didn't follow through with the plans, which he had invested time and money into. He got angry, but given the circumstances, maybe his reaction is understandable. However, he did leave the show without her, which could be seen as abandoning her, but he mentions he didn't want to sit alone in VIP. Also, he sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time, which is harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend was drinking despite his warnings, which could be irresponsible. But if they're in a relationship where she feels comfortable drinking, maybe he should have set boundaries earlier. Did he communicate his concerns clearly? He asked her a couple times if it was a good idea, but she insisted. So maybe he did his part, but she was insistent.\n\nHe left the show alone, which might have been a mistake. Maybe he should have waited longer or handled the situation differently. But given the cost and his frustration, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn terms of the fight, he blew up, which could be inconsiderate, but he was frustrated with the wasted plans. She blames him, but she was the one who got drunk and couldn't attend the show. However, the blame game is part of the problem.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author tried to accommodate her, but she didn't respect his efforts. However, he did act out in anger. Maybe both have faults, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often look for who's more at fault. The girlfriend's irresponsible drinking led to the date's failure, but the author's reaction was harsh and sarcastic. However, he did try to manage the situation. The key points are her drinking despite his concerns and his reaction. The author might be justified in being frustrated, but his sarcastic remark could be seen as insensitive. However, she also blames him unfairly.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, if one person's actions caused the issue, they might be the one at fault. Here, her actions led to the wasted date, but he reacted poorly. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the info.\n\nConsidering all that, the girlfriend's actions directly caused the problem (drinking excessively leading to missing the show), while the author's reaction was a consequence. However, his sarcasm and anger might have escalated things. But in terms of who's \"in the wrong,\" the primary fault might lie with her for not respecting the plans. But since the question is about the author, if he's in the wrong, maybe not. So the answer is B (No).\n"
