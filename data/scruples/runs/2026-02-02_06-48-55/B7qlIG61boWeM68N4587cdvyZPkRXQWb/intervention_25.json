Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a Valentine's Day date gone bad because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author set up a special day, tried to accommodate her, but she ended up ruining the plans by drinking too much. The author then left the show and had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author adjusted their work schedule to have a meaningful date, which shows effort. The girlfriend started drinking before the date, brought more drinks, and got slurred at the restaurant. She then refused to go to the show, leading the author to leave. They argue, and the girlfriend wants the author to move out.\n\nNow, considering both perspectives. The author might feel wronged because they planned a special day and the girlfriend's actions spoiled it. The girlfriend might feel disrespected if the author left without trying harder to include her. \n\nBut the author did ask her if she was okay drinking and she insisted. The author then tried to accommodate her by letting her nap. When she refused to attend the show, the author made a choice to leave. The cost of the tickets was significant, and the author didn't want to waste money. However, leaving without her might have been a mistake. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction was anger and sarcasm, which could have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible, but the author's response might have been harsh. The girlfriend's demand for the author to move out seems extreme, but it's her right to express her feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author tried to be understanding, but maybe should have handled the situation more calmly. However, the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. The author's anger is understandable, but the sarcastic comments and leaving might be seen as their part in the conflict. However, the girlfriend's extreme behavior and the fight leading to the breakup might place more blame on her. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were the primary cause, and the author had valid reasons to be upset. But some might argue the author could have handled it better. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the information, the main fault lies with the girlfriend, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
