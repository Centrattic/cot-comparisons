Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is the asshole. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date where the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to an argument and a potential breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author worked to rearrange his schedule to spend the day with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with a friend before they were supposed to go out. He was annoyed because he knew she tends to get too drunk once she starts. On the way to the restaurant, she brought more beer. At the restaurant, she ordered more drinks, got very drunk, and then they went to a show where she fell asleep. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone with VIP tickets. Then they argued on the drive home, leading to a fight and her kicking him out. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend's alcohol consumption, the author's reaction to it, and the argument. The author is frustrated because she ignored his concerns about drinking, leading to a ruined date. He left the show alone because she was asleep, which might be seen as a problem. Did he have a right to be upset? She was drinking despite his warnings, costing them money and ruining the plans. But did he handle it appropriately?\n\nHe asked her multiple times if it was okay for her to drink, and she said it was fine. He might not be responsible for her choice to drink more once they were at the restaurant. However, when she passed out during the show, he had the option to wait or take her home, but instead left. Maybe he could have tried to make her go in anyway. But the tickets were expensive, and it's understandable he didn't want to sit alone. The argument later escalated, and he was sarcastic about the costs. That might have been the wrong approach. \n\nOn the other hand, she was clearly the one who consumed too much alcohol and ignored his concerns. She also blames him for ruining the date. The question is whether the author is wrong for leaving the show and reacting the way he did. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author left the show without ensuring she was okay. Even though she was asleep, maybe he should have waited or tried to get a refund. His sarcastic comment might have been harsh, but the primary problem was her drinking. The girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
