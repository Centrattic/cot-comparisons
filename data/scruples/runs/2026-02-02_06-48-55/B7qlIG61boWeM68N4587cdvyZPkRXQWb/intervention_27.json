Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to arguments and a possible breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special, expensive date. He adjusted his work schedule to be with her, which shows he was invested. The girlfriend, however, was already tipsy when he came home and continued drinking during the drive and at the restaurant. She ended up too intoxicated to enjoy the burlesque show, which the author paid for. He left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP seats. Later, there's an argument where she accuses him of ruining the date, and now she's asking him to move out.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author tried to accommodate her by changing his schedule, planned a special day, and even tried to make the best of the situation despite her drinking. He asked her if she was sure about drinking more, so he wasn't ignoring her. The girlfriend's actions seem to be the main issue here; she chose to drink excessively, leading to the date being cut short and the argument. The author left the show when she was unresponsive, which might be seen as a reasonable decision since he couldn't attend alone. The fact that she later blamed him and wants him to move out suggests her behavior escalated the conflict.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe he should have been more insistent on her not drinking, or maybe he should have waited longer for her to nap. But given that she was already drunk and uncooperative, his options were limited. He did try to give her time to rest before leaving the show. The main problem seems to stem from her alcohol consumption and subsequent behavior, not the author's actions. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial and emotional investment, and his reaction (though he admits to yelling sarcastically) might be a result of feeling let down. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's choices led to the problems, and the author tried to manage the situation as best as he could given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
