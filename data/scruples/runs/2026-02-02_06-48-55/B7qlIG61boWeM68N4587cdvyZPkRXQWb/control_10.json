Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario described. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to an argument and the author considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author worked to adjust their schedule for a special date. The girlfriend was already drinking with friends before the date started. He was concerned she might get too drunk but she insisted it was fine. She continued drinking during the drive and at the restaurant, leading to her being very intoxicated. The author tried to accommodate her by letting her nap in the car but ended up leaving the show alone because she wouldn't wake up. He felt frustrated and angry, leading to an argument and the girlfriend wanting him to move out.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's frustration is understandable. He planned a special evening, and the girlfriend's behavior disrupted it. However, did he do anything to contribute to the situation? The user might argue that he didn't stop her from drinking despite his concerns. But he did ask her multiple times, and she insisted it was okay. So maybe he's not entirely at fault there.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the date not happening as planned. She was aware of the plans and still chose to drink excessively. The author tried to handle it patiently, but when her behavior caused the show to be missed and led to the argument, his reaction seems like a response to her actions.\n\nIs there any point where the author overstepped? He left the show alone, which could be seen as a reasonable decision given the circumstances. The argument that followed was probably fueled by her intoxication and his frustration. The girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out might be an overreaction as well, but that doesn't absolve the author of any responsibility.\n\nWait, did the author have a right to be upset? Yes, because he invested time and money into the date, and her actions spoiled it. However, maybe he should have addressed her drinking more firmly earlier on. But he did ask her, and she kept drinking. So maybe he's not wrong for being upset. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, the main cause seems to be the girlfriend's excessive drinking. The author's actions were reactive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on if he did something wrong beyond reacting to her actions. Since he tried to accommodate her and only expressed frustration when she blamed him, it's more likely that the blame lies with the girlfriend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
