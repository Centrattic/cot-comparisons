Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a Valentine's Day date that turned into a fight. The author planned a special day, including a fancy restaurant and a show, but his girlfriend got really drunk, leading to them having to cut the date short. He ended up leaving the show alone because she wouldn't come, and now they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author mentions he adjusted his work schedule to make the day happen, showing effort. He was concerned about her drinking, asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. Then she continued to drink, leading to her being unable to enjoy the planned activities. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend wanted to celebrate and had plans with friends. She might have felt it was okay to drink because they were on a date but maybe didn't consider how it affected the plans. The author felt frustrated because his efforts were wasted. \n\nThe author is upset about the wasted money and the plan not working out. He left the show, which she might have felt was abandoning her, even though she was too drunk to attend. The argument escalated, and he said some sarcastic things about the cost and time. \n\nNow, who's at fault? The author tried to warn her about drinking, but she continued. He acted in a way he thought was best to avoid a worse situation (leaving the show instead of sitting alone). However, his sarcastic remarks could be seen as harsh. Was he justified in blowing up at her? Maybe he felt wronged because she ignored his concerns, but yelling might not be the best response. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the plans not working out, so she's partly responsible. But the author could have handled the situation better, like finding an alternative or staying to watch the show by himself if he really wanted to. Also, moving out and the fight might be an overreaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he was trying to make a good plan and his partner disregarded his concerns, maybe not. But his reaction of yelling and sarcastic comments could be seen as harsh. However, considering the financial loss and the wasted effort, maybe he's justified. But since he's asking if he's the asshole, the question is about his responsibility. The key points are that he tried to communicate his concerns, she didn't listen, and he ended up making a mess of the situation. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author is upset about the wasted money and effort, which is understandable, but his reaction (yelling and sarcastic remarks) might be inconsiderate. However, given the context, he's not entirely wrong. The girlfriend's actions were a bigger problem, but the author's handling of the situation could have been better. So maybe he's not the asshole, but there's room for improvement. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. So maybe I need to consider if the author should have handled it differently. Did he have the right to be angry? Yes, but his reaction might be the issue. Alternatively, if he had communicated better or found a solution instead of leaving the show, that could have been better. But in the end, the main problem was the girlfriend's excessive drinking, so the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because he tried to manage the situation, asked her before, and his frustration was due to her actions. His reaction could be better, but he's not the main asshole here.\n"
