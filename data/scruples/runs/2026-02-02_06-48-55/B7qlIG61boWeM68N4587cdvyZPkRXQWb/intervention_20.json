Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special Valentine's Day date, adjusted his work schedule to be off, and the girlfriend went to a bar with friends before the date. The girl was already tipsy when they met up. The author asked her if drinking more was a good idea, but she insisted. Then she continued drinking at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. The show they had tickets for was expensive, but she couldn't attend because she was too drunk. The author left the show alone, and later they fought, with the girl blaming him and then sending a message to move out.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions clearly impacted the date. She made choices to drink despite knowing the plans. The author tried to manage her drinking, asked her, and then when she was too drunk to attend the show, he left. However, he did end up being sarcastic and blaming her after the fact. The key points here are consent to drink, communication, and handling the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's responsibility is significant here. She chose to drink excessively even after being warned. The author did warn her and tried to let her sober up, but when she refused to attend the show, he left. However, his sarcastic remarks and anger might have contributed to the argument. But was he wrong to be upset? He spent money and time on a date that she ruined by getting drunk. On the other hand, she might not have been forced to drink; it was her choice. The author did try to accommodate her by adjusting his schedule and driving her home. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it better. Instead of blowing up at her, maybe he should have been more understanding. However, the main issue is her actions leading up to the date. The girlfriend's excessive drinking and then blaming him seems to be the bigger issue. The author's response, while perhaps harsh in words, might be a reaction to the frustration of a ruined date. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the wrong is usually on the person whose actions directly caused the problem. Here, the girlfriend made the choices to drink. The author tried to manage it but was upset. So, the author is not the one in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
