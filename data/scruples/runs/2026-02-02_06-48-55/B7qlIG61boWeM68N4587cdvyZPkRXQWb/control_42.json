Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight between the author and his girlfriend after a Valentine's Day date that went poorly because she got too drunk. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a special day, rearranged his work schedule to spend time with her. She was at a bar with friends before meeting him, got tipsy, and then drank more during the drive to the restaurant. Despite her being drunk, he went along with the plans. At the restaurant, she became more intoxicated, ordered more drinks, and by the time they got to the show, she was too drunk to attend. He ended up leaving alone, and later there was a fight where she blamed him.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he invested time and money into the date, and she ruined it by getting drunk. He felt it was her fault and even sarcastically thanked her, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is about whether he did something wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He planned a special day, tried to accommodate her, even though she was intoxicated. He tried to handle it by driving, letting her have a nap, but she didn't show up to the show. He was upset and expressed frustration, which led to a fight. His actions might be justified because he's responsible for the plans and his money. Also, she was the one drinking excessively, which led to the problem.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She got too drunk despite knowing the plans. She might have not communicated her needs or listened to his concerns. However, maybe she thought she could handle her drinking. \n\nBut the author's actions: He left the show alone because she was too drunk. He didn't take her to the show as planned. However, she was unresponsive and he didn't want to sit alone. Is that his fault? Also, he did try to handle it, but maybe he could have handled the situation differently, like finding alternative plans if she was too drunk. However, the main issue was her drinking. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because she was the one who drank excessively and didn't manage her own behavior. He expressed concerns but she insisted. The problem was her actions, not necessarily his. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, sometimes in these AITA scenarios, if someone is a bit harsh in their reaction, they might be considered the asshole. But in this case, he was trying to make the best of a bad situation, and her actions led to the date failing. So he's justified in his frustration. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
