Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight and possible breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date, moved his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She was already tipsy when he arrived, drank more beer in the car, then ordered cocktails at the restaurant. She became so drunk that she slurred her words and struggled to stand. Then at the show, she passed out, and he decided not to attend alone. She later accused him of leaving without her, leading to a big argument.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The girlfriend's excessive drinking seems to have disrupted their plans. The author tried multiple times to check in with her about drinking, but she insisted it was fine. The author then had to deal with her being too drunk to attend the show. He left, which she claims he didn't agree to, and ended up arguing.\n\nNow, considering accountability: the girlfriend made choices to drink beyond what was appropriate for the date. She might be at fault for not respecting the plans and the money spent. However, the author's response\u2014leaving the show without her\u2014could be seen as abandoning the situation. Did he handle it well? Maybe not. He could have tried to handle the situation differently, like calling someone for help or finding another solution instead of leaving. But was he in the wrong for prioritizing his time and money? Potentially, because he did leave her in a bad state.\n\nBut also, the girlfriend's actions led to the situation. She consumed alcohol despite the author's concerns. The author might feel wronged by having to cancel plans due to her choices. However, he could have set firmer boundaries earlier. The blame here is shared, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the girlfriend's actions caused the problem, so the author isn't entirely at fault. However, his decision to leave without her could be seen as abandoning her, which is a problem. But given the circumstances, maybe he's not the main asshole here. So leaning towards B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
