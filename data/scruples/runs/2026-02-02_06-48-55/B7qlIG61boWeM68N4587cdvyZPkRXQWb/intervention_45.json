Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the couple planned a special Valentine's Day. The author adjusted his work schedule to be with her. The girlfriend went to the bar with friends, came home tipsy, then drank more on the way to the expensive restaurant. The author tried to stop her, but she insisted. Then she got more drunk at the restaurant, leading to the show being skipped. The fight happened afterward, and she blames the author.\n\nThe author is upset because he's angry about the wasted money and time. He says he's not the type to yell but did so this time. She's threatening to make him move out.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she went out with friends, came home drunk, kept drinking despite his concerns. That's her choice, but it's impacting their plans. The author tried to communicate his concerns, but she dismissed them. He might feel frustrated, but is he in the wrong?\n\nThe author left the show alone because she was too drunk. He paid for VIP tickets. She claims he left without her, but he explains he gave her time to sleep. He's upset because she ruined the plans. Is he right to be angry? Maybe, but he did leave an expensive event empty-handed. Did he handle it correctly?\n\nHe got angry and sarcastic, which might have escalated things. But he was reacting to her actions. The key points are communication. Did he do enough to address her drinking? He asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea. She reassured him. So he tried. Once at the show, she was out, so he had to make a choice. Leaving might not be the best, but he was trying to avoid sitting alone. \n\nThe fight escalated when she blamed him. He was furious, which is understandable. But did he overreact? He sarcastically thanked her for the waste. That's harsh, but given the context, maybe he had reason. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend made choices that led to the ruined date. But the author could have handled it differently. Maybe he should have set firmer boundaries earlier, like not letting her drink more if she was already tipsy. But he did try to stop her. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, both sides often have some fault. The girlfriend's actions disrupted the plans, but the author's reaction might have been harsh. However, the girlfriend's response of wanting him to move out seems extreme. The author might have been in the right to be upset about the wasted money and effort. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He tried to prevent the situation but ended up frustrated. However, his reaction (yelling, sarcasm) might be part of the problem. But given the context, maybe he's justified. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because both have faults. But AITA usually sides with the person who tried to do the right thing. Since the girlfriend made poor choices and blamed him, he's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
