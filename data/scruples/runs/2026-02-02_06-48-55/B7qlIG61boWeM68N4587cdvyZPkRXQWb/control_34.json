Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The story is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the plan being ruined and them fighting.\n\nFirst, the author made an effort to rearrange their work schedule to spend time with their girlfriend. They planned a special date, including a pricey restaurant and show. The girlfriend, however, started drinking before the date, brought more beer in the car, and by the time they got to the restaurant, she was slurring her words. She ordered more cocktails there, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author tried to accommodate her by waiting, but eventually left the show alone. After that, the girlfriend blamed him for the ruined date, and they had a fight, leading to her wanting him to move out.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author mentions that he asked her a couple times if drinking was a good idea, and she reassured him. So he tried to check in. The girlfriend made the choice to drink excessively despite knowing the plans. She also blamed him for ruining the date, even though she was the one who got too drunk. The author's frustration is understandable because he invested time and money into the date, which was ruined due to her actions. \n\nHowever, the author did leave the show without her, which could be seen as a bit harsh. But considering the circumstances\u2014VIP tickets, the show being sold out, and her being incapacitated\u2014it's reasonable to think he didn't want to go alone. The girlfriend's reaction of blaming him might stem from her own guilt or frustration, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend made choices that led to the date's failure. The author tried to handle it as best as he could, even going along with the plan despite her condition. The fact that she later passed out and gave him the \"tell me you'd wait\" line that he didn't have, shows she might be deflecting blame. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue here is the girlfriend's actions and her subsequent blame-shifting. The author made reasonable efforts to accommodate her and the situation, but the responsibility for the ruined date lies more with her. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
