Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a couple's Valentine's Day date gone wrong. The author (AITA) is the boyfriend. He planned a special day, but his girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them missing part of the event and a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend moved his work schedule to be off for the day, which shows effort. The girlfriend was at a bar with a friend before the date. When he arrived, she was already tipsy. He wanted to have a nice date but she kept drinking more, even in the car. At the expensive restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more drinks. Then she passed out during the show, leading him to leave. She later accused him of ruining the date, and they fought. Now she wants him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Is the boyfriend at fault? Well, he did plan a special occasion and tried to accommodate her, even when she was drinking. But maybe he could have handled the situation differently. For example, when she started drinking more, he asked if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. So she was making her own choices. However, when she passed out, he left the show. Was that right? He paid for VIP tickets and didn't want to sit alone. But maybe he should have waited longer or tried to get her to go in. \n\nAlso, there was a fight where he sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time. That's pretty harsh. But he was upset because she ruined the plans. The girlfriend is blaming him, but she was the one who got drunk. However, maybe she felt disrespected by his sarcasm. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the boyfriend overreact? He planned a lot and it was ruined by her actions. She made her own choices to drink, but he could have been more understanding or found a solution. However, leaving the show might have been necessary. The argument where he was sarcastic might be his fault. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions led to the problems, but he could have handled it better. However, the story is from his perspective, and he's asking if he's the asshole. In many AITA threads, if someone is trying to make their partner do something (like not drink) but the partner ignores them, the partner is at fault. However, the boyfriend did ask her, and she insisted. So maybe he's not the one to blame. The fact that she's now asking him to move out might be her overreacting. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to check again. Did he have a right to be angry? Yes, because she ruined the plans. But maybe he should have been more patient. However, given that she was inconsiderate, he's not entirely wrong. So B.\n"
