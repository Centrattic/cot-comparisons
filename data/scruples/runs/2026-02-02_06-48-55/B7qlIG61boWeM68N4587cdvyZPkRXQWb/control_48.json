Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation involves a planned Valentine's Day date that went poorly because the girlfriend got very drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author planned a special day, adjusted their work schedule, and spent a lot of money. The girlfriend started drinking before the date, continued during the drive and the meal, and then became too intoxicated to attend the show. The author left the show early and later had a fight, leading to her wanting to break up.\n\nOn the author's side: They tried to accommodate the girlfriend's plans, warned her about drinking, and tried to make the best of the situation even when she was getting drunk. They ended up paying a lot of money for a date that didn't go as planned. When the girlfriend became too drunk, they made a decision to leave to avoid wasting time and money. The author's frustration is understandable given the effort and cost involved.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She started drinking before the date and continued despite the author's concerns. Her actions led to the date being spoiled. She blamed the author for leaving the show, even though the problem was her own intoxication. However, she might have felt that the author was being too strict, or that she was having a good time and didn't realize the extent of her drinking.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of their relationship. The author tried to respect the girlfriend's decisions about drinking, even though they disagreed. The girlfriend's behavior was a choice, and the author can't be blamed for that. The author's frustration stems from the financial loss and the effort they put into planning. The breaking point was when the girlfriend blamed him, leading to an argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author made an effort to plan, tried to be understanding, and made a reasonable decision to leave when the situation became untenable, it seems like the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. The author isn't at fault for the money spent or the effort; they can't control her drinking choices. However, the sarcastic remark about the cost might have been harsh, but it's in response to the girlfriend's behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions led to the problems, and the author had the right to make decisions to salvage the situation as best as they could.\n"
