Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fight between the author and his girlfriend after a Valentine's Day date that went south due to her drinking.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special night, adjusting his work schedule to have time off. He mentions that the girlfriend was already tipsy when he arrived home, and she continued drinking on the way to the restaurant. At the restaurant, she ordered more drinks and became slurred. Then, at the show, she passed out, and he left without her. The fight ensued, leading to a breakup threat.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author is clearly frustrated and feels wronged, especially since he invested time and money into the date. He had to manage her intoxication, which led to a ruined experience. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014drinking excessively despite being warned, leading to the date being cut short\u2014could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nBut where's the line? The author could have stopped her from drinking more, maybe by not letting her bring beer in the car or by being more insistent when he questioned her. However, he asked her a couple of times, and she said it was fine. So he might have relied on her self-regulation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was the main cause of the ruined date. She ignored his concerns and drank to the point of passing out. The author left the show alone because it wasn't enjoyable without her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did he do enough to prevent her drinking? Was he justified in leaving the show once she was unresponsive? The girlfriend's actions were the direct cause, but the author's reaction\u2014getting angry and sarcastic\u2014might be seen as harsh, even if he was upset. However, considering the context, he tried to accommodate her despite her choices. \n\nIn AITA stories, the person who causes the problem is often the one in the wrong. Here, the girlfriend's drinking led to the issues, but the author's response could be seen as valid given the circumstances. However, the author's decision to leave the show alone might be seen as a reasonable choice, as he didn't want to waste the tickets. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he tried to handle the situation, and the girlfriend's actions were the root problem. He had to make a choice between staying alone or leaving, which he did. His anger is understandable given the waste of time and money. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
