Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong, and I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and his girlfriend had a Valentine's Day date. He adjusted his work schedule to spend the day together. She was at a bar with a friend when he was leaving work. Upon arrival, she was already tipsy and brought more beer in the car. At the restaurant, she got more drinks, leading to slurred speech. Then, at the burlesque show, she was so drunk she passed out and refused to go. The author left, she blamed him, and they fought, ending with her wanting him to move out.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author planned a special occasion, but his girlfriend's drinking ruined the date. He tried to warn her about drinking more in the car, but she insisted. When she passed out, he left the show alone. Then, he got angry and sarcastic, and she blamed him.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author tried to accommodate his girlfriend by changing his work schedule. The girlfriend drank excessively despite his warnings, leading to the date's failure. The author left the VIP show alone instead of sitting there by himself. He got angry when she blamed him for ruining the date.\n\nBut where's the fault here? The girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. She didn't listen to his concerns about drinking and then held him responsible. However, the author's reaction was to leave the event and then express frustration, which might have contributed to the argument.\n\nIs the author at fault? Maybe not entirely. He tried to handle the situation as best as he could. But perhaps he could have handled it more calmly. However, the main issue seems to be the girlfriend's behavior. She drank too much, ignored his concerns, and then blamed him. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. But I need to be careful. If he had a responsibility to ensure she didn't drink too much and failed, maybe he's partially at fault. But he did warn her and she ignored him. So perhaps the main fault is on her. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
