Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special Valentine's Day date, adjusting his work schedule to be off. He met his girlfriend at a restaurant, but she was already tipsy and brought more beer. She drank more at the restaurant, leading to her being slurred and struggling to stand. Then, for the show, she was too drunk and eventually passed out in the car. The author left the show alone because he didn't want to sit there by himself, and she later accused him of leaving, leading to a fight.\n\nThe author is upset because he spent $340 and time on the date, and she ruined it by getting too drunk. He ended up being angry and sarcastic, and she asked him to move out. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend made choices to drink alcohol before and during the date, which affected their plans. The author tried to manage the situation by driving her home instead of attending the show alone. However, he did leave without her, which might be seen as abandonment. But he also mentions she was passed out and told him to fuck off when he tried to wake her. The tickets were non-refundable, and he didn't want to sit alone, which is understandable. \n\nBut then, when she accused him of leaving, he got angry and sarcastically blamed her. His reaction might have been harsh, especially if he didn't give her a chance to explain her side. Also, after she passed out, he might have handled the situation differently. However, she was the one who consumed alcohol excessively despite his warnings, which led to the date being cut short. \n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility. The girlfriend's actions directly caused the problem, but the author's reaction (yelling, sarcasm) could be seen as over the top. However, given that she was drunk and uncooperative, his frustration is understandable. The question is whether his response was in the wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, both parties share responsibility. The author tried to accommodate her despite her getting drunk, but when she blamed him, his anger might have been justified. However, his sarcastic comments about wasting money and time could come off as cruel, especially in the heat of the moment. \n\nBut considering the context, she was the one who made poor choices with alcohol, leading to the date's failure. The author's decision to leave the show might have been reasonable given the circumstances. However, his reaction to her accusations might have been the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the author had handled the situation calmly and discussed it later, maybe the outcome would have been different. But in the moment, his frustration led to an argument. Since the main issue was her excessive drinking, which led to the problem, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, his response could have been better. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, sometimes the person who is more directly responsible for the problem is considered the asshole. Here, the girlfriend's actions caused the date to go wrong, so the author might not be the asshole. However, his reaction could also be seen as harsh. But given that she was drunk and uncooperative, maybe his response is understandable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue was her drinking, but he could have handled the conflict better. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which could be subjective. If the community typically sides with the person who made the plans and the other ruined them without considering consequences, then he's not the asshole. But if the community thinks his reaction was too harsh despite her actions, then he might be the asshole. But given the details, I think the main fault lies with the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
