Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got really drunk. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule, and they had a fight leading to her wanting a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author arranged time off work to spend with his girlfriend, which shows he cared about the date. He was annoyed when she got tipsy early and continued drinking, leading to issues at the restaurant and the show. He tried to handle it by acting normally but ended up leaving the show alone because she was too drunk to attend. They had a big fight later.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's actions: she was at a bar with friends before the date, got more drinks in the car, then more at the restaurant. She ended up too drunk to attend the show. She blamed the author for ruining the date and later threatened to make him move out. It seems like her excessive drinking was the main problem. She might have not respected the plans and the effort he put in.\n\nThe author did ask her if it was a good idea to drink, and she said it was fine. So he might have given her the choice, and she still drank. However, maybe he should have set a firmer boundary earlier if he knew this would happen. But considering she kept drinking despite his concerns, maybe he's not entirely at fault. He tried to make the date work even when she was slurring, then left the show when she was unresponsive. Ending the date early was probably necessary.\n\nThe fight happened when she blamed him for leaving the show, but he argued she wasted time and money. He's not the one who started the fight, but he did blow up, which isn't ideal. However, given her behavior, maybe he had enough. She's the one who kicked him out and wants him to move out, which is a strong reaction. \n\nOverall, the main issue is her drinking leading to the date being ruined. The author tried to accommodate her but had to leave when it was impossible. He's not the one causing the initial problem. So the answer is B; he's not the asshole.\n"
