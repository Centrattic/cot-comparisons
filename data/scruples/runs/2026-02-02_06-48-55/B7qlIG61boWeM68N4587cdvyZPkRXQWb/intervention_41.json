Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who had a Valentine's Day date, but the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the date being cut short and the author considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author worked to be off for the weekend to have a special date. The girlfriend was at a bar before the date, then brought more beer on the drive to the restaurant. She ended up slurring words at a fancy place, ordered more drinks, and then passed out at the show. The author left because he didn't want to be alone, and later there was an argument. The girlfriend wants him to move out now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a different opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He planned a special, expensive date. He was accommodating by adjusting his work schedule. The girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. He left the show because she was unresponsive, which was understandable given the cost and the fact that it's a VIP seat. He expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which might have escalated the fight. However, he didn't force her to drink and she insisted despite his concerns. His reaction of sarcasm and anger could be seen as justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She might feel that the author was too controlling, not respecting her choices to drink. Her behavior could be due to stress, social anxiety, or other factors. When he left, she was upset and might have felt abandoned. Her reaction of wanting him to move out is extreme, but it's possible she's reacting in a moment of anger or hurt. However, she did confirm the plan was for them to go on the date together, and her drinking impeded that. \n\nThe author didn't force her to drink, and she was aware of the plans. He tried to accommodate her by driving home early when she was unresponsive. The cost of the date is a factor\u2014$340 is a lot for a special occasion. The author's anger might be valid because she didn't consider the financial and effort aspects. \n\nBut, the girlfriend's actions were her choice. She drank despite knowing the plans. The author left the show, which she might see as abandoning her. The argument escalated because he was sarcastic. He could have handled the situation more calmly. However, the girlfriend's response of wanting him to move out seems harsh, especially if he's being honest about his feelings. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the author did his part to plan a nice date and tried to be understanding. The girlfriend made choices that ruined the plans. The author's frustration is justified, but his sarcastic comment about the money might have been a trigger. The girlfriend's extreme reaction (kicking him out, wanting a move out) could indicate deeper issues. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and taking action to leave when she was unresponsive. The girlfriend's responsibility lies in her own choices. But the author could have handled the argument better. Still, the main fault is on her for ruining the plans. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
