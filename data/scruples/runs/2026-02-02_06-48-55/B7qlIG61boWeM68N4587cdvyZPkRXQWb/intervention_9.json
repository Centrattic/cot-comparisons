Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a big fight between a couple on Valentine's Day. The author set up a special date, but his girlfriend got very drunk. He tried to handle it, but ended up leaving the show early, and now they're breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author rearranged his work schedule to have the day off for Valentine's, which shows he put effort into the date. The girlfriend was already drinking when he arrived home, then brought more beer in the car, got slurred speech at the restaurant, ordered more cocktails, and passed out during the show. The author left because she was too drunk to enjoy the show, and then a fight broke out about the wasted money and time.\n\nSo, the author's main points are that he planned a special date, she ruined it by getting drunk, he left the show to avoid sitting alone, and she blamed him. He's now being asked if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the user is asking for my opinion. To decide between A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no), I need to assess both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions did disrupt the date. She drank excessively despite being warned, leading to the show being unattended. The author tried to handle it by waiting, but she was uncooperative. He left the show, which cost money, and felt justified in his anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently. Maybe he should have set clearer boundaries earlier. For example, when she started drinking in the car, he could have insisted she stop to avoid the problem. But he let her continue, perhaps out of trying to be understanding. However, when she passed out, he had to decide whether to stay or leave. He chose to leave, which might have been a reasonable decision given the cost and his own enjoyment.\n\nBut wait, did he communicate his expectations beforehand? If he had told her that he didn't want her to drink during the date, maybe she wouldn't have done it. He mentioned asking a couple of times if it was a good idea, but she reassured him. So he trusted her judgment, which backfired. Also, when she blamed him for ruining the date, he acted out in anger, which might not be the best response.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's behavior was self-centered. She spent the money on a special date but then ruined it by getting drunk. She might be responsible for her actions. However, the author's reaction\u2014yelling and sarcastic remarks\u2014could have been harsh, escalating the situation. But he was upset about the wasted money and time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, it means he made a mistake in handling the situation. If B, then she was wrong for getting drunk and ruining the date.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had a right to be upset and to leave the show. Since she was unresponsive, and the show was a shared event, maybe he had a right to leave. However, the fight after might have been his fault for lashing out. But considering the circumstances, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend's actions were the main problem, but the author's reaction could have been more measured. However, in the end, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. If the majority of the fault lies with the girlfriend, then the author isn't the asshole. If the author could have handled things better, maybe he is.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A: Yes, B: No. I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were the primary issue. He tried to accommodate her, but she chose to get drunk, leading to the ruined date. His frustration is understandable, and leaving the show when she was unresponsive makes sense. The blame isn't on him. However, his reaction could have been better, but that doesn't make him the asshole in the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
