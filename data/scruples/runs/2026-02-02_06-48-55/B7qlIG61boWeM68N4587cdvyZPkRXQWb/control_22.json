Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a couple having a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got drunk and they couldn't enjoy the planned activities.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule to be with her. She was already drinking at a bar with friends before they met up. He was annoyed because she tends to get wasted when she starts drinking, and he had a nice date planned. She kept drinking more on the way to the restaurant and during the meal, leading to her being very drunk. Then at the circus show, she passed out and he left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP seats. They fought later, and she blames him for ruining the date and wants him out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The author tried to plan a nice day, communicated with her about the schedule, and even let her know he was leaving work. She was the one who drank excessively despite his concerns. He tried to accommodate her by letting her nap, but when she didn't come around, he left. He also expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. Maybe he should have been stricter about not letting her drink more once she was already tipsy. But he did warn her multiple times, and she insisted it was fine. Also, leaving the show because she was passed out might be a point of contention. However, the main issue seems to be her excessive drinking and not respecting the planned activities, leading to the fight.\n\nThe author is not the one who started the drinking or the partying. He made efforts to make the date happen, and she chose to drink beyond what was reasonable. While he might have overreacted in the argument, the root cause was her actions. So, is he the asshole? Probably not. The main responsibility here lies with her for overindulging and not respecting their plans. The author is within his rights to express frustration over the ruined plans due to her choices.\n"
