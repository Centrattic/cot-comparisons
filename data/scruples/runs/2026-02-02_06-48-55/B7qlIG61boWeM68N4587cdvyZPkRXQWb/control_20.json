Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple had a Valentine's Day plan, which the author worked to make happen by adjusting his schedule. He mentions that his girlfriend was drinking with a friend before they left. When he arrives home, she's already tipsy. The author is annoyed because he knows she tends to get wasted once she starts. They have a date planned, including a drive to an expensive restaurant and a show. She continues to drink in the car, leading to slurred speech at the restaurant. There, she orders more cocktails and struggles to stand. At the show, she passes out and he leaves, which leads to an argument and her blaming him. The fight ends with her asking him to move out.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to plan a special day, but his girlfriend's actions disrupted it. He mentions she got more drunk despite his concerns. He left the show because she was unresponsive, which she later claims he agreed to. The author is upset about the wasted money and effort.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he tried to accommodate her, but she ignored his concerns. However, maybe he could have addressed her drinking more directly or set boundaries. On the other hand, she was the one who made decisions leading to the bad outcome. The fight might stem from her actions, but the author's reaction (yelling, sarcastic comments) could be seen as harsh. But considering the circumstances, he's frustrated after trying to make things work. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but her actions are the main issue. The answer would likely be B, No.\n"
