Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a fight between a couple over his girlfriend's drinking during a special Valentine's Day date.\n\nFirst, the author planned a nice date, rearranged his work schedule to spend time with her. She was already drinking at a bar before they met up. He tried to be understanding but was annoyed because he knew she might get too drunk. She kept drinking in the car and at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. The author tried to handle it by not confronting her immediately, but when she couldn't attend the show, he left, and that's when the argument happened.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The girlfriend's actions: She was drinking despite the author's concerns, which led to them not being able to enjoy the planned activities. The author tried to accommodate her by driving home, but then they fought. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they spent a lot of money and effort on the date. However, the girlfriend's drinking might have been a result of her own choices, but the author could have addressed it earlier instead of letting it escalate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author left the show without her, which might have been a hasty decision. But he was trying to salvage the night by not sitting alone. Also, the girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out after the argument seems harsh. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is mutual responsibility. The author tried to handle things calmly until the end, but his sarcastic comment about the money and time might have been a mistake. However, the girlfriend's actions were the root cause. The author isn't entirely at fault, but maybe he could have communicated better earlier. However, since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, the answer likely leans towards B (No). The girlfriend's behavior was the main problem here, and the author's frustration is a reaction to her choices.\n"
