Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date that went poorly. The author is the boyfriend, and they ended up breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points of the story. The boyfriend rearranged his work schedule to have a special date with his girlfriend. She was at a bar with friends, then brought beer in the car, got very drunk, and ended up not being able to attend the show they paid for. The author left the show alone because it wasn't fun without her. They ended up fighting, and she wants him to move out.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole here. The user thinks he's in the wrong. Let me think about both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He planned a special date, tried to accommodate her by moving his work schedule, and was patient even when she got drunk. He asked her if drinking was a good idea multiple times, and she insisted. The author left the show alone because he didn't want to be there without her. He expressed frustration about wasting money and time, but he was trying to make the date work as long as possible.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She went to the bar before the date, brought alcohol into the car, got very drunk during dinner, and then passed out during the show. She blamed him for the problems and wanted to go to the show after she napped, which didn't happen. Her actions led to the date being cut short and caused a fight.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible, as she was the one who consumed alcohol excessively, leading to the bad experience. The author tried to manage the situation, but her actions made it impossible to enjoy the planned activities. The author's frustration is understandable, as he invested time and money into the date, but his reaction of blowing up at her and sarcastically thanking her might have been harsh. However, he did try to be patient and make the best of it as long as possible. \n\nThe girlfriend's demands to move out and her blaming him might be an overreaction, but the root cause was her choice to drink heavily. The author's annoyance is justified, but his anger and sarcastic comment could have been handled better. However, the main issue is her behavior leading up to the fight. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend bears a lot of the blame for her actions. The author is not entirely in the wrong because he tried to accommodate and communicate, but his response could have been more understanding. However, since the question is whether he's the asshole, the answer might hinge on whether his actions were proportionate. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I think the girlfriend's actions were the main problem. The author did try to be reasonable, even though his anger was a mistake. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if I missed anything. The author left the show alone because she was passed out, which was a reasonable decision. The fight was caused by her blaming him and his frustration. Overall, the author's actions seem justified given her behavior.\n"
