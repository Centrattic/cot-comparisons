Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date gone wrong. The author is the boyfriend, and he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The boyfriend rearranged his work schedule to spend the day with his girlfriend. They had a special dinner at an expensive restaurant, then a burlesque show. The girlfriend had been drinking before and during the date. She got so drunk that she couldn't attend the show, and he left early. They fought, she wants him to move out, and he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's drinking, the boyfriend's reaction, and whether he handled it appropriately. The author is annoyed about her drinking because it ruined their plans. He tried to let her drink in the car, but she kept getting more drunk. At the restaurant, she ordered more drinks. Then at the show, she passed out and he left. He's upset about the wasted time and money, and he blew up at her. She blamed him and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Was he wrong to leave the show? Well, the tickets were expensive, and he didn't want to sit alone. But maybe he should have handled it differently, like trying to talk to her or waiting longer. However, given that she was unresponsive and passed out, his options might have been limited. \n\nHis anger might be justified because he planned this special day and she ruined it. But his response\u2014yelling and sarcasm\u2014could have been inappropriate. Also, did he do anything to prevent her from drinking too much beforehand? He asked a couple times if it was a good idea, but she insisted. So maybe he's not fully responsible, but perhaps he didn't take stronger measures to stop her from drinking. \n\nOn the other hand, she took responsibility for her actions by getting drunk and missing out on the show. But blaming her entirely might not be right because the boyfriend could have set boundaries earlier. For example, not letting her bring beer in the car or stopping her from ordering more drinks at the restaurant. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out seems extreme, but maybe the boyfriend's response was also harsh. However, the main conflict arises from her choices. If he's not responsible for her actions, then he's not the asshole. But if he didn't do enough to prevent the situation, he might share some blame. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whose actions were more problematic. Since the girlfriend's drinking directly led to the ruined date, and the author's reactions, while possibly harsh, were in response to her actions, it's possible he's not the asshole. However, if he could have done more to prevent her from drinking, he might share some responsibility. But given the situation, he tried to accommodate her and only left when there was no other option. So, probably the answer is B (No), meaning he's not in the wrong.\n"
