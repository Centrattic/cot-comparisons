Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to an argument and potential breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a special day, adjusted his work schedule, and made a significant financial investment in a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend was already tipsy before leaving, drank more during the drive, and became more intoxicated at the restaurant. The author tried to handle it gracefully but ended up leaving the show early when she was too drunk to attend. Then there was a fight, with both parties blaming each other.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author have a right to be upset about the plan being ruined? He made efforts to make the day special. On the other hand, did he handle the situation poorly? Maybe he should have addressed her drinking more directly or set boundaries earlier. Also, when she was drunk and unresponsive, leaving the show might have been a reasonable decision since he didn't want to sit alone. But did he communicate properly? The girlfriend claims he left without her consent, which led to the argument. The author also mentions he's not the type to yell, but he did get angry. \n\nAnother point: the girlfriend's actions caused the plan to fall apart. She chose to drink despite warnings. However, as a couple, mutual respect and communication are important. The author might have a right to be upset, but maybe he should have handled it differently. Conversely, the girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible, but the author's reaction might have been harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers if both parties have valid points. If the author's anger was justified due to her actions ruining the plans, then he might not be the asshole. However, his sarcastic remark about the money and time could be seen as harsh. Also, maybe he should have supported her more instead of leaving the show. But the girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate towards his efforts. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the girlfriend's irresponsible drinking disrupted a special event, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, his reaction (leaving the show, sarcastic comments) might be seen as part of the problem. But since she was clearly at fault for the main issue, maybe the author isn't the asshole. The answer might be B (No), he is not in the wrong.\n"
