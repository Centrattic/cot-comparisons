Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got too drunk. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author adjusted his work schedule to spend the day with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with a friend before the date. He met her at home, she was already tipsy, then she brought more beer in the car. At the expensive restaurant, she ordered two more cocktails and was slurring. Then, after dinner, they were supposed to go to a show, but she passed out in the car and wouldn't wake up. The author left the show alone, and later they fought, with the girlfriend blaming him and demanding he move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend made choices to drink a lot despite warnings. She ignored his concerns, leading to the date being ruined. The author tried to accommodate her, even after she got drunk. He paid for an expensive dinner and the show, but she ended up not participating. He left the show alone, which he considered a waste of money and time. Then, when she later accused him of ruining the date, he got angry.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he tried to make things work even when she was already drinking. He asked her if it was a good idea, and she insisted. He didn't force her to drink. The girlfriend's actions led to the situation. However, the author's response might be seen as harsh\u2014yelling and sarcastically blaming her. But given the circumstances, maybe he's justified in being upset about the financial and time loss. The girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out seems extreme if she was at fault. So, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are that the girlfriend made her own choices despite knowing the plans, and the author tried to handle it patiently until it became impossible. The answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
