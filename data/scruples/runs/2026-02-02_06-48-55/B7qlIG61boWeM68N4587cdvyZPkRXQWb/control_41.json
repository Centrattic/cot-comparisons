Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a breakup scenario where the couple had a bad fight after Valentine's Day plans went wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule, and wanted a nice date. The girlfriend was drinking both before and during the date, leading to issues at the restaurant and show. The author tried to accommodate her, even staying with her in the car, but eventually left the show alone because she was too drunk. They had a fight, she wants him to move out now.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility for the situation. The author kept trying to adjust to her actions, like allowing her to drink more despite his concerns. He asked her a couple times if it was a good idea, and she said it was. So maybe he gave her the chance to make her own decisions, but she still overdid it. However, he did try to handle things calmly, even acting like everything was fine during the dinner. When she became unresponsive at the show, he left out of respect for the tickets, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior led to the plans falling apart. She blamed the author for ruining the date, which seems unfair. The author had valid reasons for being upset: wasting money, time, and effort. He didn't yell or escalate things until she started blaming him. \n\nIs the author wrong? He tried to be accommodating, but she didn't listen. He left the show because he couldn't enjoy it alone, which is reasonable. The fight happened when she accused him of ruining it, and he expressed frustration. He wasn't the one who initiated the conflict. The girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He made efforts to make the date work despite her actions. The main issue is her responsibility for her own drinking and then blaming him. The answer should be B.\n"
