Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in the situation described. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date where the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the plans being ruined and a big fight.\n\nFirst, the author planned the day carefully, adjusting his work schedule to have time off. He mentions that the girlfriend went to the bar with a friend before he left work. When he arrives home, she's already tipsy. He's annoyed because he knows she tends to get wasted once she starts. They have a drive to a fancy restaurant, and she brings more beer. He asks her if it's a good idea, and she says it's fine. \n\nAt the restaurant, she's slurring words and ends up ordering more cocktails. The total expense is $240, which is a big deal since they're not rich. Then they were supposed to go to a show, but she's too drunk and passes out in the car. The author decides to leave early, not wanting to sit alone in VIP seats. She later claims he was supposed to wait for her, but he didn't know that. They argue, and she blames him for ruining the date. She kicks him out and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The girlfriend chose to drink despite the author's concerns. He asked her a couple of times if drinking was a good idea, and she insisted it was. The author made a judgment call to leave the show because he didn't want to be alone, and he's upset about the wasted money and time. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he made an effort to communicate his concerns. The girlfriend took his reassurances at face value and then acted in a way that led to the problems. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial and emotional investment. He didn't force her to drink; she made her own choices. The fact that she later blames him and accuses him of ruining the date suggests that the main responsibility lies with her. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a point where the author could have been more proactive in preventing her from drinking. But he did ask her, and she said it was fine. So he might not be at fault. The answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
