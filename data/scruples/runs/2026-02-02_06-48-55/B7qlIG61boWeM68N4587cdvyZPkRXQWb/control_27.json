Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a couple who had a bad fight after Valentine's Day plans fell apart because the girlfriend got too drunk. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She met friends at a bar, then they drove to a fancy restaurant. She drank more in the car and at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. The show they were going to attend couldn't happen because she was passed out, and the author left early. They fought, she wants to break up.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author made an effort to create a special day, adjusted his schedule. The girlfriend, on the other hand, drank despite his concerns, leading to the plans failing. The author left the show early, which cost money and time. But was there any fault on his part?\n\nPossible points against the author: Did he encourage her drinking? He asked her a couple of times if she was sure, but she insisted. He might have not stopped her despite knowing she was getting buzzed. Also, when she was passed out, he didn't wait for her as she claimed he said he would. But he says that conversation didn't happen. He left the show alone, which she might feel was abandonment.\n\nPoints in the author's favor: He tried to accommodate her by changing work hours. He expressed concerns about her drinking, and she ignored them. She was the one who ended up too drunk to enjoy their plans. The author acted in the moment, leaving the show to avoid sitting alone, which is understandable. He got angry but it's in response to her actions.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is responsible for her drinking. Since he asked her and she insisted, he might not be at fault. However, he could have been more proactive in preventing her from drinking more, especially after she was already affected. The fight escalation where he sarcastically thanked her might have been harsh, but it's in response to her actions. She is the one initiating the breakup, so maybe he's not the asshole here. But there's a nuance.\n\nWait, but the author left the show alone. The girlfriend might feel he gave up on her, but he had paid for VIP tickets and didn't want to sit alone. He tried to wake her multiple times. The fight led to him blowing up, which might be harsh, but she was blaming him. The question is whether his reaction was justified. The main issue is her actions leading to the ruined date. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
