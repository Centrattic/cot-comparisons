Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple having a fight after a Valentine's Day date gone wrong. The author (AITA) is the boyfriend, and he's seeking validation on whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The boyfriend rearranged his work schedule to have a special day with his girlfriend. They had a big restaurant dinner and a show planned. The girlfriend went to the bar before meeting him, got tipsy, continued drinking during the car ride, and then at the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails, becoming very drunk. At the show, she passed out, and he left because he didn't want to sit alone. She later accused him of ruining the date, leading to a fight and her kicking him out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The girlfriend's actions: she drank a lot despite the boyfriend's concerns, which led to the plans being ruined. She also blamed him for leaving, even though he had already spent money on the show. The boyfriend tried to accommodate her, even when she was getting too drunk, and then left when she was unresponsive. He was upset about the wasted money and time, which is understandable. However, he did get angry and sarcastically criticized her, which might have contributed to the fight. \n\nBut considering she was drunk and making poor decisions, the boyfriend had to make a choice. Leaving the show when she was unresponsive might have been necessary, especially since she wasn't going to enjoy it. The girlfriend's behavior was the main issue here\u2014excessive drinking leading to the cancellation of plans, then lashing out. The boyfriend's frustration is valid, but his response (yelling, sarcastic comments) might have been harsh. However, given the circumstances, he was trying to salvage what he could. \n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's actions led to the problem, but the boyfriend's reaction also played a role. However, the primary responsibility lies with the girlfriend for overindulging and not respecting the plans. The boyfriend tried to handle it as best as he could. So, the answer would likely be B (he's not the asshole), but I need to check if there's any major misstep on his part. He did ask her if drinking was okay, and she insisted. He left the show when she was uncooperative. His anger was justified given the circumstances. The girlfriend's blaming him is misplaced. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
