Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a guy who had a fight with his girlfriend over her drinking during their Valentine's Day plans.\n\nFirst, the setup: They had a special date planned. The author rearranged his work schedule to spend the day together. His girlfriend was already at the bar with friends when he was leaving work. He gets home and she's tipsy. He's annoyed because she tends to get wasted once she starts. They had to drive to an expensive restaurant. She brought more beer, drank more in the car, and by the time they arrived, she was slurring her words. The date was supposed to be special, but she ordered more drinks and ended up too drunk to function. Then they were supposed to go to a show, but she passed out and refused to go. The author left the show and drove home. She later accused him of ruining the date and told him to move out.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's true. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The key points here are consent and communication. The author mentions that she was drinking more while they were in the car, and he asked her if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. So he didn't force her to drink. The restaurant was expensive, but they went there anyway. The problem arises when she's too drunk to attend the show, leading to the argument.\n\nThe author's actions: He left the show because she was too drunk and he didn't want to sit alone. She later claims he left when she said she'd join later, but he didn't hear that. The argument escalates, and he yells sarcastically about the money and time wasted. She blames him and kicks him out, telling him to move.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he tried to accommodate her (even though he was annoyed), let her drink as she wanted (within reason, since she agreed), and made a decision when she was incapacitated. The problem is that he left the show without her knowledge, but she was already passed out and unresponsive. The sarcastic remark about the money could be seen as harsh, but he was frustrated. \n\nOn the other hand, she chose to drink despite the plans, leading to the date being ruined. The author did his part to make it a nice day. She's the one who ended up too intoxicated. However, the argument and his reaction might have been unkind. But considering the circumstances, maybe he's not the one at fault. The girlfriend's actions led to the problem, and the author made a reasonable decision to leave when she was clearly too drunk to participate. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
