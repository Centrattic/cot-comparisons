Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the plans being cut short and a big fight.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The author planned a special day by moving his work schedule. He wanted to spend time with his girlfriend. She was already tipsy when she came home, then drank more beer in the car on the way to the expensive restaurant. At the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails and became very drunk. Then she passed out during the drive to the show, and the author left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP seats. The fight happened on the way home, and now she's telling him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. The author planned a special day, spent money on a restaurant and a show. He tried to handle the situation by driving home when his girlfriend wouldn't attend the show. He's angry about the wasted time and money. But did he do something wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions led to the plans not going as intended. She got drunk despite the author's concerns. She might be in the wrong for not respecting the plans. However, the author could have handled it differently. For example, maybe he should have been more understanding if she was too drunk, or maybe he could have tried to support her instead of leaving the show. But leaving the show because it wasn't fun for him might be seen as selfish, especially since he paid for VIP tickets. But he did say that he didn't want to sit alone and it wouldn't be fun. It's possible he made a mistake in leaving, but also the girlfriend's intoxication was a major factor.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He invested time, effort, and money into the date, and she undermined it with her actions. However, he could have communicated better. When she was passed out, maybe he could have waited longer or tried to engage her differently. But given that she was drunk and unresponsive, leaving might be a reasonable choice. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response might also be questionable. However, the main issue is that the girlfriend made a choice to drink excessively, which ruined the plans. The author did his part to accommodate her as much as possible. So maybe the blame is more on her side. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
