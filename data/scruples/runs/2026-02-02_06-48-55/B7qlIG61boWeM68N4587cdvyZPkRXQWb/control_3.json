Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date gone wrong because the girlfriend got really drunk. The author is frustrated because they planned a special evening, adjusted their work schedule, and the girlfriend ended up ruining the date by drinking too much. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author worked to make the date special, but the girlfriend started drinking before they even got to the restaurant, continued drinking there, got too drunk, and then they couldn't attend the show. The author ended up leaving the show because she was asleep/drunk, and then they had a big fight. Now the girlfriend wants the author to move out, and the author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author planned a special date, spent money, and made sacrifices. The girlfriend's excessive drinking disrupted their plans. The author tried to manage the situation by letting her drink at first, tried to wake her up, and eventually left when she was unresponsive. The author's anger seems justified given the effort and expense involved. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have set clearer boundaries earlier. Did they confront her about drinking before it got out of hand? The girlfriend might have felt disrespected if the author didn't communicate their concerns more effectively. Also, the author's sarcastic comment about the money could have been harsh, which might have escalated the fight. However, the girlfriend's actions were the main cause of the problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014if she knew her friend was getting drinks and still brought more beer in the car\u2014shows she wasn't considering the author's plans. Her getting drunk to the point of being unable to attend the show and then blaming the author is a significant issue. The author's decision to leave the show and drive home might have been a reasonable response to the situation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who acted unreasonably. The girlfriend's actions seem to be the primary problem here. The author tried to accommodate her, but she disregarded the plans. The author's reaction, while emotional, is a response to the girlfriend's behavior. The final argument and the girlfriend wanting the author to move out might be her taking responsibility for her actions, but it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's excessive drinking and subsequent blame-shifting are the main issues. The author made efforts to make the date work but was let down. So the answer should be B.\n"
