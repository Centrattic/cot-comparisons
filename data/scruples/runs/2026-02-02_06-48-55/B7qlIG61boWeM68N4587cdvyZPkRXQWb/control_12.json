Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got too drunk. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule to be with her, and they ended up having a fight.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend went to the bar with a friend while he was working. When he got home, she was tipsy. He was annoyed because he knew she might get wasted, and they had a nice dinner planned. She drank more on the way to the restaurant and during the meal, leading to her slurring. Then at the show, she passed out and he left, which she later blamed him for. They fought, and she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author tried to accommodate her by changing his work schedule. He expressed concern about her drinking before the date but she insisted it was fine. He even paid for expensive tickets and tried to handle the situation as best as he could. When she got too drunk to attend the show, he left, which she later accused him of ruining the date. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be responsible for her own actions. She ignored his concerns about drinking, which led to the problems. However, maybe the author could have set firmer boundaries earlier. But he did ask her multiple times if drinking was okay, and she said it was fine. So he might not be entirely at fault. The fight was her blaming him for something he tried to prevent. \n\nConsidering all this, the main issue is her actions leading to the ruined date. The author tried to be understanding but was let down by her choices. He left the show because she couldn't attend, which seems reasonable. The blame is more on her for not respecting his efforts. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
