Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date where both the author and his girlfriend had plans, but she ended up getting really drunk and the date fell apart.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he rearranged his work schedule to have the day off to spend with his girlfriend. That seems like a big effort on his part. Then, his girlfriend was at a bar with friends when he was finishing work. She came home tipsy, and he was worried because they had a nice dinner planned. She continued drinking in the car, which he tried to stop, but she insisted it was okay. At the restaurant, she got more drinks and was slurring her words. The author acted like everything was fine, but she ended up too drunk to go to the show. He left early and then they fought about it.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). To decide this, I need to consider both sides. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is definitely a factor here. She drank heavily despite the plans, which led to the date not going as intended. The author tried to manage the situation, even though he was annoyed. He made compromises, like driving her to the restaurant even when she was drunk, and tried to follow her supposed plan to wait and then go to the show. But in the end, she was too drunk and he had to leave.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction might be a point of contention. He got angry and sarcastically thanked her for wasting money and time. That could be seen as harsh, especially in the heat of the moment. But considering the situation\u2014he spent a lot of money on a special occasion, adjusted his work schedule, and she didn't respect the plans by getting drunk\u2014it's understandable he was upset.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author do something wrong to contribute to the problem? He tried to communicate with her about the drinking, but she ignored him. He made the decision to leave the show when he realized she wasn't going to make it, which was probably the best option given the circumstances. The girlfriend's actions led to the breakdown of the date, so the fault mainly lies with her.\n\nThe author might have failed to communicate more effectively earlier, maybe not confronting her about the beer in the car more firmly. But given that he asked her a couple of times and she insisted she was fine, he might have done all he could. The girlfriend's blame-shifting and subsequent demand for him to move out seems unfair. The author's frustration is justified given the effort he put in and the waste of resources. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the main issue is his girlfriend's actions and reaction.\n"
