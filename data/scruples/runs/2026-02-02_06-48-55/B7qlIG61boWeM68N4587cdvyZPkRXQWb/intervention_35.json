Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading the author to leave the show and the fight that followed, ending with her telling him to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author rearranged his work schedule to have a special day with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with friends while he was at work. When he arrived, she was already tipsy and continued drinking during the drive to the expensive restaurant. He was annoyed because he knew she tends to get wasted once she starts. The date was supposed to be special, but she ended up too drunk to enjoy it, leading to them leaving early and the show not happening. Then, halfway home, she claims he told her to go in after napping, which he didn't. He got angry, called her out for wasting money and time, and they ended up in a fight. Now she wants him to move out.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is at fault for his reaction. The user thinks he is, but the author is conflicted. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions disrupted the plans. She drank excessively despite his concerns, which led to a ruined date. The author had a right to be upset because he made sacrifices and spent a lot of money. Leaving the show might have been the right decision since she was too drunk to participate, and he didn't want to sit alone. His anger about the wasted resources and time could be justified, especially if they can't afford such expenses easily.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe he should have talked to her calmly in the car instead of waiting until halfway home to confront her. Yelling and sarcastically calling her out in a sarcastic way might have escalated the fight, even if he was frustrated. Also, the fact that she's now blaming him entirely and wants him to move out suggests that his response was perceived as harsh or dismissive. If he had communicated his concerns earlier or found a solution during the drive (like skipping the show and going home), maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated as much.\n\nBut the girlfriend's behavior was definitely problematic. She ignored his concerns, kept drinking, and ended up making the date a disaster. Her aggression when he left the show and the false claim about what he said might indicate she's defensive and trying to shift blame. However, the author's decision to act unilaterally by leaving the show could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was too drunk to enjoy it. Also, his sarcastic remark about wasting money might hurt her feelings, making her feel like the experience wasn't valued regardless of her actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a two-way street. The girlfriend's excessive drinking is a significant issue, but the author's reaction might have made things worse. The key here is whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. He did compromise by driving for hours, but when she was already drunk, he had to make a choice. Leaving the show to avoid being alone might not be wrong, but the way he communicated his frustration could be. The question is if he's the one primarily at fault. The girlfriend's behavior was the main problem, but his reaction could have been handled better. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions were justified or not. Since he tried to accommodate her and still left the show to avoid being alone, maybe he's not the asshole. But the sarcastic comment and blowing up could be seen as harsh. Hmm. I think both did things that contributed, but the main issue is the girlfriend's excessive drinking. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong (B). Wait, but the user said they might be single tomorrow, so the author might be in the wrong if his actions caused the breakup. But the root cause was her behavior. It's a bit tricky. I need to weigh who is more at fault. The girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined, but the author's reaction could have worsened the situation. However, since the premise is about the author being the asshole, if the majority of the blame is on her, then the answer is B. If the author's reaction was unwarranted, then A. But the girlfriend's behavior was the main problem. The author's frustration is understandable. So probably B.\n"
