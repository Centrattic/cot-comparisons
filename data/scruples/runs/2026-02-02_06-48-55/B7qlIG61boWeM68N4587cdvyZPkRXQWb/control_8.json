Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight and them possibly breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author tried to make it a special day by adjusting his work schedule. The girlfriend was already tipsy before they even started the date. He mentioned being annoyed because once she starts drinking, she tends to overdo it. They had a nice, expensive dinner and a show planned. She kept drinking during the car ride, leading to her being slurred at the restaurant and then passing out during the show. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP, which cost money. Then she blamed him for ruining the date and he got angry, leading to a fight and her wanting him to move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend clearly made choices to drink despite his concerns. She continued to drink in the car, which the author had warned her about. She ended up too drunk to enjoy the planned activities. The author tried to accommodate her, like letting her nap in the car, but when she refused to go to the show, he left. He also expressed frustration about the money spent, which is understandable because they aren't wealthy. His anger seems to stem from feeling that she ruined a special occasion he went out of his way to plan.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently. Maybe he should have been more firm in not allowing her to drink in the car, or maybe set boundaries earlier. However, he did ask her if it was a good idea, and she insisted. He also tried to be understanding, giving her time to nap. The girlfriend's behavior was the main issue here\u2014she ignored his concerns, spent money on a date she didn't fully participate in, and then blamed him. The author's anger, while perhaps intense, seems to be a reaction to her actions. \n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's decision to drink excessively despite knowing it would affect the date, the author's attempts to manage the situation, and her subsequent blame. The author isn't in the wrong because he tried to accommodate her, and her actions directly led to the problems. His frustration is justified given the financial investment and the effort he made. The girlfriend's behavior appears to be the main issue here. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
