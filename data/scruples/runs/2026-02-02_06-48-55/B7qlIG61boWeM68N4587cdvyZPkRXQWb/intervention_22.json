Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple's Valentine's Day date that went badly because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to an argument and a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date, adjusted his work schedule, and spent a significant amount of money. The girlfriend, on the other hand, drank alcohol before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to enjoy the activities they paid for.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's alcohol consumption affected the date, the author's frustration with her behavior, and the subsequent argument. The author feels wronged because he tried to accommodate her but she ruined the plans. The girlfriend blames him for the situation.\n\nI should consider if the author had a responsibility to handle the situation differently. Did he confront her about the drinking during the date? He asked a couple of times if it was a good idea, but she insisted. Maybe he should have been more direct in stopping her if he knew she couldn't control herself. Also, when she was too drunk for the show, he left. Was that the right decision? He didn't want to sit alone in a VIP section, so he left. But maybe he could have tried to stay or found another solution instead of leaving her in the car.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were a significant part of the problem. She chose to drink despite the plans, which led to the date being ruined. The author did make an effort to plan and spend time, but her choices directly impacted their plans. However, the author's reaction\u2014leaving the show and then blowing up at her\u2014might have been harsh. He could have handled it more calmly.\n\nIn terms of who is at fault, the main issue is the girlfriend's decision to drink excessively, which ruined the date. However, the author's response, especially the sarcastic comment about the money and time, might have escalated the situation. The question is whether his reaction was justified given her actions.\n\nTypically, in AITA scenarios, if one person's actions directly led to a problem, they're considered the asshole. Here, the girlfriend's choice to drink was the root cause. However, the author's handling of the situation also plays a role. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe they believe he should have managed the situation better. However, given that the girlfriend's actions were the primary problem, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
