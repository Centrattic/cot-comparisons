Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date. The author planned a special day, but the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the date being cut short.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author adjusted their work schedule to spend time with their girlfriend, which shows effort. They tried to manage her drinking by asking her questions, but she insisted on continuing. The girlfriend's actions led to missing the show and the author feeling frustrated. However, the author's response was to blow up, be sarcastic, and potentially kick them out of bed. The girlfriend then asked them to move out.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have a right to be upset? Probably. The girlfriend's excessive drinking ruined the plans they had made. But did the author handle it appropriately? The author's response was to yell and sarcastically comment about the wasted money and time. That's harsh. Also, the author left the show alone, which might not have been the best choice, but it's understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did drink a lot despite the author's concerns. She blamed the author for the problem, which is unfair. The author's frustration is valid, but their reaction might have been too extreme. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is being asked if they should accept her behavior as okay, then the answer is B (not in the wrong). But if the author's reaction was too harsh, maybe they are partially at fault. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's actions leading to the date's failure. The author's anger is a reaction to that, so they might not be the main wrongdoer here. But the argument is about whose fault it is. Since the author is asking if they should accept the situation, the answer would be B because they aren't in the wrong for being upset and making a decision to leave the show. The girlfriend's actions were the main problem, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
