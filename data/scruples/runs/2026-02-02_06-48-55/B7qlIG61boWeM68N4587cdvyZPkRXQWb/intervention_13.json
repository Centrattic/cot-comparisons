Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nSo the author planned a special Valentine's Day date with his girlfriend. He moved his work schedule to be off, but she was at the bar with friends when he was leaving work. When he got home, she was tipsy. He was annoyed because he had a nice date planned. They drove to an expensive restaurant, and she continued drinking beer and then cocktails, getting very drunk. At the restaurant, she was slurring words. Then they went to a show, but she was so drunk she passed out and he left. She later blamed him for ruining the date and kicked him out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The girlfriend got very drunk despite the author's concerns. He asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea to drink, and she said it was fine. But maybe the author should have been more firm in stopping her from drinking, especially since he knew she tends to get wasted. However, the girlfriend was the one who chose to bring more beer and kept drinking, which led to the problem. The author tried to accommodate her, even though it ruined the date. \n\nOn the other hand, the author left the show without her, maybe without giving her enough time to recover. But he had paid for VIP tickets and didn't want to sit alone. Also, she told him to fuck off when he tried to wake her. The fight escalated when she blamed him, and he sarcastically thanked her. The key points are her actions leading to the ruined date and his reaction. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions seem to be the main cause. She ignored his concerns about drinking, got too drunk, and blamed him. The author tried to handle it patiently but had to leave the show. His anger was because of her actions. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I need to check if the author did anything wrong. Did he push her to drink? No, she brought her own beer. He asked if it was okay, and she said yes. So he followed her lead. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
