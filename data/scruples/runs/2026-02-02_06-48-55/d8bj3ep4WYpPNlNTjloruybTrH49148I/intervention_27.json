We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it. The main points here are about shared living arrangements, joint purchases, and the ethical implications of the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the TV was bought by the author using their Amazon account, but the cost was split three ways. So while the purchase was made under the author's name, the financial responsibility was shared. The second TV was a free one that came by mistake. The author decided to sell it, and the roommate who wanted to buy it but was turned down eventually found out the author sold it to someone else. The roommate is upset and feels entitled to a share of the money.\n\nThe key question is whether the author had the right to claim and sell the second TV without consulting the other roommates. Even though the original purchase was under the author's account, the initial agreement was that any profits from selling the TV later would be split three ways. But this was in case of a sale of the original TV, not a second one. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, but since it was a mistake by Amazon, maybe the roommates should have discussed how to handle it. \n\nThe author's decision to sell the second TV without considering the roommates might have been a mistake. While the author believed it was their TV to handle, the initial joint purchase and the fact that the second TV was a result of the original shared expense could imply that the roommates had a shared interest in both TVs. Even if the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, the fact that they were in a shared living space and the original cost was split might mean that the value of both TVs should be considered as a shared asset, especially since the error was on Amazon's part. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that she felt entitled to a portion, but entitlement depends on the agreement. If there was no prior agreement about the second TV, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that the author didn't consider the roommates at all in the decision to sell could be seen as selfish, especially since the initial purchase was a joint one. The author might have assumed ownership based on the original purchase, but the presence of the second TV complicates this. \n\nIn shared living situations, transparency is important. The author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates before selling it. Even if the author believed it was theirs, the fact that the original purchase was shared could mean that the roommates had a stake in the additional TV. The author's failure to consult them might have led to the conflict. \n\nSo, while the author might not be legally in the wrong, ethically, they could be seen as having made a mistake by not considering the roommates and the original agreement. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and didn't take into account the shared nature of the original purchase.\n"
