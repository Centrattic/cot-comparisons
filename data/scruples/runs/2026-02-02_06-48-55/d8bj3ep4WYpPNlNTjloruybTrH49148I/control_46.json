We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and a TV that was accidentally delivered twice.\n\nFirst, the main points: The user bought a TV using their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then, Amazon delivered an extra TV. The user sold that second TV, thinking it was theirs. One roommate got upset and demanded a share of the money, while the other didn't. The AITA question is whether the user was wrong to sell the second TV without sharing the proceeds.\n\nSo, the key factors here are ownership and agreement. The original TV was purchased under the user's name, but the cost was split three ways. The second TV is a mistake by the seller. The user and roommates had agreed that profits from selling the original TV would be split. But the second TV wasn't part of their initial agreement. \n\nThe user sold the second TV, thinking it was theirs. The roommate argued that since they contributed to the original purchase, they should get a share. But the original agreement was about the TV they ordered. The second TV is an unexpected bonus, not part of the initial purchase. So, the user might not be obligated to share that.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since they were splitting costs for the original, the second TV's value could be considered communal. But the user didn't ask for the second TV; it was an error. The roommate's demands came after the fact, without prior agreement. \n\nThe user's actions were based on their belief that the second TV was theirs, especially since it was under their name. The roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled without a prior agreement. The other roommate had no issues. Legally, if the TV was delivered to the user's address under their account, they might have a claim. But ethically, if the user didn't discuss ownership of the second TV with roommates before selling it, they might be in the wrong for not considering their input.\n\nBut the user thought they were doing a kind thing by selling it. The roommate's reaction seems excessive since there was no prior agreement. The user's mistake was not discussing the second TV's ownership with everyone. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. So, maybe the user isn't wrong, but perhaps they should have clarified ownership first.\n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the second TV's ownership was a shared asset or the user's personal property. Since the user paid for the original using their account, the second might be considered theirs, but the roommates contributed to the original. But the second was an error, so maybe the user is entitled to keep it. However, the user didn't get consent from the others before selling. So maybe they should have discussed it. If the roommate felt entitled, but there was no agreement, the user isn't necessarily wrong but perhaps should have communicated better.\n\nIn the end, the user is probably not in the wrong because the second TV wasn't part of the initial agreement. The roommate's claims are based on an entitlement not previously established. So answer B.\n"
