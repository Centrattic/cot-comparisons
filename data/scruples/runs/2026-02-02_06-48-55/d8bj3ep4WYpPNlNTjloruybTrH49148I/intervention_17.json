We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person moved in with two roommates and they all agreed to buy a TV, splitting the cost three ways. The main person ordered it using their Amazon Prime. They had an agreement that when they move out, they would sell the TV and split the profits or sell it to a roommate. Then, when the TV arrived, there were two TVs. The second one was the same model but different brand. The person thought it was theirs since it was under their Amazon order and suggested selling it. They sold it without consulting the roommates, and one roommate was upset because she thought she was entitled to a share. The other roommate didn't mind.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and ownership of the second TV. The original TV was bought using their account, but the cost was split. So, even though they paid for it, the payment was shared. The second TV was an accident from Amazon, but it came with the same name. The main person assumed they owned the second one, but the roommates might have expected that since they contributed to the original purchase, the second TV would be shared as well. \n\nThe problem is that the accident (getting two TVs) wasn't clearly owned by anyone. The original purchase was a joint expense, so maybe the second TV should be considered joint property too. The person sold it without consulting, which might have been a mistake because the roommates might have had a claim to it since they also paid for the original. Even though the second TV wasn't their intention to buy, the fact that it was delivered under their name doesn't necessarily mean it's solely theirs if the initial purchase was a shared expense.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the roommates had a share in the original purchase, which could extend to the second TV. The accident might mean that the second TV is part of the same purchase, especially since the payment was split. Therefore, the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates before selling it, leading to the conflict. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
