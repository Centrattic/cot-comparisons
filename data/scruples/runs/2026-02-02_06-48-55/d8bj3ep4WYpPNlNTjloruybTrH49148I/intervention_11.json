We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author moved into a house with two roommates. They agreed to buy a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered the TV using their Amazon Prime account because there was a discount. They also had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits three ways or sell it to the roommate who wanted it.\n\nThen, on delivery day, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but the same specs. The author thought it was a mistake and decided to sell it. They didn't consider keeping it for themselves. One roommate kept offering to buy it, but the author turned down the offers. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else. The other roommate got angry, claiming the author was selfish and that they were entitled to a share of the money. The other roommate had no issues.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they were wrong to claim the free TV and not share the proceeds. They thought the original purchase was under their name, and since the second TV was a mistake, they considered it theirs.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The initial purchase was made by the author using their Amazon account, but the cost was split among the three. So the ownership of the original TV was shared? Or was the author the sole owner because they paid for it, even though the roommates contributed later?\n\nWait, the author said they split the cost three ways. So maybe when they ordered the TV under their Amazon account, they covered the cost initially but the roommates paid them back? That's a common setup. So the original TV is owned by all three, right? Because each paid a third. So the ownership is shared. But the author is the one who placed the order, which might complicate things. \n\nBut then the second TV came. Since it was a mistake, does it belong to the author? If the delivery was addressed to the author's Amazon account, maybe the second TV was mistakenly sent to the author's address. Legally, if it's a duplicate order, who owns it? The seller might consider it their mistake, but if the address is the author's, maybe the author is the rightful owner. However, since the address is a shared house, maybe the seller intended it to go to the house, not a specific person. \n\nThe author thought they could claim the second TV as their own because it was listed under their name. But the roommates might have a different perspective. Since the original purchase was a joint effort, even if the author made the order, the roommates contributed to the cost. So maybe the second TV, being an error, could be seen as part of the shared property? \n\nThe author decided to sell it without consulting the others. The roommate who was trying to buy it felt entitled to a share. The author didn't consider sharing the proceeds. The main issue here is whether the second TV's ownership was clear. If the original TV was a shared purchase, maybe the second one, being a mistake, is also shared. Or perhaps the mistake was Amazon's, so the second TV belongs to the author, and they have the right to keep or sell it as they wish. \n\nBut the problem is that the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they felt a connection to the second TV as well. The author's agreement was to split the profits when moving out, but the second TV was a free item. The author might think that since it wasn't part of their original agreement, they can do what they want with it. However, the roommates might argue that the mistake was due to the shared address and the shared purchase, so the second TV should be shared too. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author didn't consider sharing the money, which upset one of the roommates. Even if the author believed they owned the TV, maybe they should have discussed it with the roommates first. The other roommate had no issues, but one was very angry. So, perhaps the author should have been more considerate of their roommates' feelings, even if they believed they had the right to the TV. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the original TV was shared (since the cost was split), the second TV was a mistake, and the author decided to sell it without consulting the roommates. The ethical question is whether the author should have shared the proceeds. If the second TV is considered part of the shared property because the original was shared, then the author is wrong. If the second TV is entirely the author's due to the delivery being to their account, then they're not wrong. \n\nBut the original purchase was made for the shared use (living room TV), so the second TV, as an error, might also be considered communal property. Therefore, the author's decision to keep the proceeds might be ethically questionable. Even if legally they could claim ownership, ethically, they should have shared the profits. Hence, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their roommates' contributions and the shared nature of the original purchase.\n"
