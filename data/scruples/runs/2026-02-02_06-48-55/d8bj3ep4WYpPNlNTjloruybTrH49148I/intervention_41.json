We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered, selling it, and not sharing the proceeds with their roommate.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost. They ordered it under the author's Amazon Prime because of a discount. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The author thought the second one was an accident and decided to sell it. One roommate wanted to buy it from the author but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the angry roommate claims the author owes her a share.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The original TV was a group purchase, so the cost was split. The second TV came from Amazon, but ownership isn't clear. The author ordered it under their account, but since it was a joint purchase, maybe the second TV should have been considered a mistake and handled collectively. The author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, which might have been a mistake. Even though the original agreement was about the first TV, the second one wasn't part of the original purchase. However, since the purchase was made using a shared resource (the group's money), the second TV might be considered a shared asset too. The author didn't consider the roommates' claims, leading to conflict. The angry roommate felt entitled because the purchase was a joint effort. While the author might have intended to act alone, the situation requires considering the group's contributions. So, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with everyone. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
