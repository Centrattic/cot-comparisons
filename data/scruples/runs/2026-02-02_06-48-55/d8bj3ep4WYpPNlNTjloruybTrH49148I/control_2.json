We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities and expectations when roommates split a purchase.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered by one roommate under their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So, even though the purchase was made under one person's account, the financial responsibility was shared. When the second TV was delivered, the question becomes who owns that second TV. Since the purchase was made with shared funds, the second TV might also be considered a shared asset. \n\nThe author thought they could claim the second TV as their own, but since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, there's an argument that any additional benefits (like the second TV) should be shared. The author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, which led to conflict. The roommate who tried to buy it felt entitled to a portion of the profits, which the author didn't consider.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the second TV is a separate item that belongs solely to the buyer or if it's part of the shared purchase. If the original order was placed with a discount that resulted in two TVs, perhaps the second one is a result of the shared expense. Therefore, the author might have assumed ownership by default, but the roommates might have a claim because they also contributed to the purchase. \n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates' contributions when claiming the second TV, which could be seen as selfish. Even though the order was under the author's name, the shared cost implies shared ownership of the purchase. The second TV, being an unexpected bonus from the original order, might be a shared asset. Therefore, the author should have discussed the distribution of the second TV with the roommates rather than unilaterally deciding to sell it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the roommates' contributions to the original purchase, leading to the conflict over the second TV. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
