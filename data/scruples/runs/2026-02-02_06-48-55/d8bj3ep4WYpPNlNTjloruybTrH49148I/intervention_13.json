We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime for a discount. They had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The author took the second one, sold it, and didn't share the money. The roommate who tried to buy it got upset and felt entitled to a portion. The other roommate was fine.\n\nThe key points here are the original agreement and ownership of the second TV. The main TV was split costs, and there's an understanding about selling it later. The second TV was a free one that came with the order. The author thought they owned it because it was under their name, but maybe they should have considered the roommates' contributions. \n\nHowever, the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The original purchase was split, so maybe the second TV isn't part of that agreement. The author didn't share the second TV's profits with the roommates. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. But the second TV wasn't their responsibility. The author might have assumed it was their own to handle since they ordered it. \n\nWait, but the initial cost was split three ways. The second TV was a free one, so maybe the roommates didn't contribute to its cost. So the author could argue they kept the free TV. But the roommate might think since the original cost was split, the second one should be shared. But that's a stretch. The second TV was an error, not a result of their contribution. \n\nAlso, the roommate approached the author directly to buy it, so the author might have reasonably thought it was their own. If the roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, they might not have a claim. But the original agreement was about the TV they bought, not the second one. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong. The second TV was a free gift, so they can keep it. The roommate's entitlement is misplaced. The original agreement was about the TV they all paid for. The second one is separate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
