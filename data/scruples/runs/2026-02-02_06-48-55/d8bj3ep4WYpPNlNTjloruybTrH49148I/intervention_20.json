We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate, split in cost with two others. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author took the second one, sold it, and the other roommate got upset.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. They split the cost three ways. So, the initial agreement was to buy one TV, split costs, and when moving out, sell and split the profits. But then Amazon sent two TVs. Now, the second TV's ownership is the issue.\n\nThe author took the second TV, thinking it was theirs because the order was under their name. They sold it and the other roommate wanted a cut. The other roommate made offers but were turned down. Then, when the author sold it, the roommate got angry about not getting a share.\n\nThe key points here: Who owns the second TV? Since the order was placed by the author, even though they split the cost, the second TV might be considered an unexpected bonus. However, the initial agreement was about splitting the cost for one TV. The second TV wasn't part of the original deal. So, the author might think they own it because it was their order and their name on the delivery. But the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so they might feel entitled to a share of any unexpected gains from the second TV.\n\nBut wait, the second TV was an error. The author didn't pay for it, but they were the ones who placed the order. Legally, if something is delivered to you by mistake, it's usually yours to keep, provided you don't try to defraud anyone. However, in a shared living situation, maybe there's an expectation of transparency and splitting any windfalls, especially since the roommates contributed to the original purchase.\n\nThe author didn't share the second TV's existence with the roommate who wanted to buy it earlier. They sold it without negotiation. So, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with all roommates first. The fact that the other roommate was insistent on buying it from the author suggests that the roommate felt they had some claim. The author might have assumed it was their property because of the order, but in a shared expense scenario, maybe that's not the case.\n\nThe other roommate argued that the author was obligated to share the money. So, there's a difference in expectations. The author thought it was a nice gesture to sell it, but the roommate felt entitled. The question is about whether the author was in the wrong for not sharing the second TV's proceeds.\n\nIf the original agreement was only for one TV, the second one is an error. The roommates might not have contributed to the second TV's cost, but since they were part of the original purchase, maybe they feel they have a claim. The author might have been wrong to take the second TV without discussing it with the roommates. Even though the order was under their name, the shared living arrangement might imply shared responsibility for such errors.\n\nAlternatively, the author paid the full price for the original order, and the second TV was a mistake, so they might have the right to keep it. However, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they should have split the cost of the original TV, and the second one is a bonus that should be split as well. But the author didn't mention this, so they might have acted unilaterally.\n\nSo, the author could be in the wrong for not discussing the second TV with the roommates and for not splitting the proceeds. However, if the second TV was a mistake, the author might have the right to keep it. But in a shared situation, transparency is important.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have discussed the second TV with all roommates and considered splitting the proceeds, even if it was an error. Taking it without consultation could be seen as selfish, especially since the roommates contributed to the original purchase.\n"
