We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV that was accidentally delivered twice, and the author claimed the second one as their own.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased under the author's Amazon Prime with a discount, and the cost was split among three roommates. They had an agreement that if they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, when two TVs arrived, the author decided to sell the second one, thinking it was theirs. The roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author didn't accept offers. Eventually, the author sold it, and another roommate got angry about not getting a share.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong in claiming the second TV. Let's consider the key points. The purchase was under the author's account, so legally, the second TV might belong to them. However, the cost was split, so maybe there's a shared ownership aspect. The author had agreed to split profits when moving out, but this scenario is about a free TV that came as an error. The roommates might argue they contributed to the original purchase, so they should have a claim on the free item. The author didn't consider splitting the proceeds from the second TV, which could be seen as unfair, especially since the cost was shared. However, the second TV wasn't something the roommates paid for; they just split the original purchase cost. So, the author might not be in the wrong because the second TV was an unexpected bonus not tied to their shared cost. But if the agreement was about splitting any profits from the original TV when sold, the second TV might be separate. Alternatively, if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, they might feel entitled to any surplus, including the second TV. The author's decision to keep the proceeds without consulting might be the issue. Even if the author is legally right, the social expectation might be to share since the roommates helped pay for the original order. So, there's a conflict between legal ownership and social responsibility. The answer hinges on whether the roommates had a claim based on their contribution to the original purchase. Since the second TV was a result of the original order split by three, the roommates might feel they contributed to the cost that led to the error. Therefore, the author should have considered splitting the proceeds from the second TV as well. But if the second TV was a separate item not tied to the original payment split, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit ambiguous, but the key is whether the roommates had a claim to the second TV based on their shared cost. The author didn't consult them, leading to conflict. So the answer might be A (wrong) because the author should have shared the proceeds since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, making the second TV's acquisition possible. Alternatively, if the second TV was an error not related to the shared cost, then B (not wrong). But the roommates helped pay for the original order, which might have led to the error. So, maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
