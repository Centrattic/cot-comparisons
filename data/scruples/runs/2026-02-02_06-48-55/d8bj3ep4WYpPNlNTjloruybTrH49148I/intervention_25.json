We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered, which they ended up selling and not sharing the proceeds with their roommate.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The main person ordered it using their Amazon Prime. They had an agreement that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered an extra TV identical in specs but a different brand. The author assumed it was theirs and sold it, not sharing the money. One roommate was upset and felt entitled to a share.\n\nThe key points here are the ownership of the second TV and the initial agreement. The original TV was ordered under the author's name, but the second one\u2014was that part of the initial purchase? Since it was an error, Amazon probably sent it by mistake. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which they might not have been expecting. \n\nThe agreement mentioned was about splitting the profits from the original TV when moving out. The second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author might have thought it was a replacement or a free item, but the mistake could mean that the second TV wasn't part of their purchase. If the roommates contributed to the original TV's cost, they might feel entitled to any unexpected gains from a second TV if it was considered part of their shared purchase, but there's no indication that the second TV was intended for them.\n\nHowever, the author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV. The roommate who was trying to buy it might have thought it was part of the shared purchase. By selling it without discussing, the author didn't consider the roommates' potential expectations, especially since the initial agreement was about splitting profits. Even if the second TV was a mistake, the roommates might feel they should share in any unexpected gains since they were part of the original purchase.\n\nBut wait, the original purchase was split three ways, and the second TV wasn't part of that. The author ordered it under their own account, so perhaps the second TV is their personal property. However, since the roommates split the cost of the original TV, the second TV's ownership is unclear. The mistake might have been on Amazon's end, so the author should have checked the delivery and clarified ownership with the roommates.\n\nIn the end, the author sold the TV without consulting the roommates. The roommate who tried to buy it might have assumed it was shared property, hence the anger. The author's assumption that the TV was theirs alone could be the issue, especially if the mistake led to unshared gains. The ethical obligation might stem from the shared living arrangement and the initial agreement, even if the second TV wasn't part of the original plan.\n\nSo, considering the agreement and the roommates' expectations, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting and sharing the profits. But if the second TV was a separate, accidental delivery not intended for the group, then the author could have a claim. However, since the roommates contributed to the original TV's cost, they might expect any unexpected gains from related purchases to be shared. The author's failure to communicate and consider the roommates' possible expectations could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
