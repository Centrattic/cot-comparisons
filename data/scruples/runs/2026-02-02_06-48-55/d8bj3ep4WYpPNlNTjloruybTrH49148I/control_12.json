  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a TV purchase split among roommates and an extra TV delivered by accident. The main points are:\n\n1. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime with a discount. They split the cost three ways.\n2. An extra TV arrived. The author decided to sell it, keeping the money. One roommate wanted to buy it but was turned down. Later, the author sold it to someone else.\n3. The upset roommate claims entitlement to a share of the profit, but the author didn't share it, believing it wasn't their responsibility.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought with shared funds, so maybe the extra TV is also a shared asset? But the delivery might have been a mistake. The author took ownership because their name was on the order. However, since the cost was split, the roommates might have a claim to the second TV as well. The author didn't consider the roommates' possible rights to the second TV. Even though the original purchase was in their name, the initial agreement might extend to any bonuses. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, leading to conflict. The other roommate had no issues, but one was upset. So, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with all roommates before selling it. The key here is whether the second TV was a shared purchase. If they all contributed to the original purchase, the second TV might be considered part of that shared purchase. The author's decision to sell it without consulting might be the issue. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault (A) because they didn't consider the roommates' possible shared ownership of the second TV. Alternatively, if the second TV was a mistake and the author's account received it, they might have individual rights. But given the shared purchase setup, the author should have included everyone. So, AITA? Probably A.\n"
