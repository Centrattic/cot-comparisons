We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. They bought the first TV under their Amazon Prime, split costs with two roommates, and agreed to split profits from the original TV when they sell it. Then, Amazon sent a second TV. The person decided to sell the second one and didn't split the money with the roommate who kept trying to buy it.\n\nFirst, the original TV's cost was split three ways, so the ownership is shared? But the purchase was made under the person's account. The agreement was about selling the original and splitting profits. The second TV was a free one sent by mistake. The key here is whether the second TV is considered part of the original purchase. If it was a mistake, maybe the ownership isn't shared. The person didn't share the second TV's proceeds, which the other roommate felt entitled to. The other roommate approached them specifically, thinking it was theirs. \n\nBut since the second TV was a separate delivery and not part of the initial agreement, the person might not be obligated to split the profit. However, maybe they should have discussed it with the roommates first, even if the agreement was only about the original TV. The question is about entitlement. The person didn't think the others were entitled, but the other roommate felt they were. The answer depends on whether the free TV was part of the shared purchase. Since it was a mistake and not paid for, maybe it's their to claim. But if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a claim. Hmm. I think the person isn't in the wrong because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. Answer B.\n"
