We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that three roommates bought a TV together, split the cost, and agreed on how to handle it when they moved out. The author ordered it under their own Amazon Prime account. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but the same specs. The author decided to sell the second TV, and when they did, one roommate got upset and demanded her share of the money. The author didn't give them any money, thinking they weren't entitled to it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the agreements they had. The original TV was bought with a shared cost, split three ways. They had a plan to sell it and split the profits when moving out. But when the second TV came, how did they handle that? The author took ownership and sold it without consulting the roommates. Now, the question is whether the second TV is the author's to do with as they please or if it's part of the shared purchase.\n\nThe key points here might be: 1) Who paid for the second TV? If the original order was placed by the author under their Amazon account, maybe the second TV was an error, and the cost wasn't shared. If the cost was split for the first TV, the second one might not have been part of that agreement. The author might have received a free TV due to an error, so the cost wasn't covered by the roommates. Therefore, the author might be the sole owner of the second TV, making it their property to sell without sharing the proceeds. However, if the roommates contributed to the cost of the second TV somehow, that would be different.\n\nBut according to the original purchase, the author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, and the roommates agreed to split the cost. The second TV was an error, not part of the original purchase. So, the roommates didn't pay for the second TV. The author got an extra TV from Amazon's mistake. In that case, the author is the rightful owner of the second TV, so selling it without sharing the proceeds might be justified. However, maybe there's an ethical argument that since they were sharing the house and the original TV was for communal use, the second TV should also be considered communal. But the author didn't think that way, and the other roommate had no issues. The problem was only with one roommate who tried to buy it from the author but was refused.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the second TV was theirs because the original purchase was under their name. But if the second TV was a result of an error, and the cost wasn't shared, then the author's claim might be valid. However, if the roommates expected any shared ownership of any TVs in the house, especially if the second one was considered part of the same purchase, then the author might be in the wrong. But the original agreement was only for the first TV. The second one wasn't part of that agreement. So, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the problem is the roommate's belief that they were entitled to a share. Maybe the author should have clarified ownership of the second TV earlier. But since the original purchase was split three ways, maybe the second TV, even if an error, should have been discussed and owned collectively. The author acted on their own, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on whether the second TV's ownership was agreed upon. If the author didn't consult the roommates and assumed sole ownership without their input, even if the second TV was an error, maybe they should have shared the proceeds. But if the roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, the author might not be in the wrong. However, since the first TV was a shared purchase, the presence of a second TV in the shared living space might imply it's also a shared asset. But the author ordered it under their account, which complicates things. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the second TV was an error and the roommates didn't contribute to it.\n"
