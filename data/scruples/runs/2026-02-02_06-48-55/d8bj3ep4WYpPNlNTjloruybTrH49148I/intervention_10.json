We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking a second TV that was mistakenly delivered and then selling it. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author and two roommates bought a TV together, split the cost, and agreed to sell it when they moved out, splitting the profits. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same specs.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership and agreement. The original TV was bought with a shared cost, so even though it was ordered under the author's account, the cost was split three ways. Therefore, maybe the ownership should be shared. The second TV\u2014since it was a mistake, maybe it's the author's personal property? Or does it belong to the group since the order was for a shared purchase?\n\nThe author assumed they could take the second TV because it was under their name, but the order was made for the group's benefit. The other roommate tried to buy it from the author, but the author sold it, leading to a conflict.\n\nLegally, if the TV was purchased with shared funds, even if ordered under one person's account, the ownership might be joint. So selling it without consent could be an issue. But the original agreement was for the first TV. The second TV was a mistake. Did the group have an agreement about any additional items? The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, assuming it was theirs. But since it was part of the same order, maybe they should have discussed it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the second TV came under their name, but the initial purchase was a shared expense. So maybe the author didn't have sole rights to it. The other roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the cost. Ethically, even if the author thought it was a nice gesture to sell it for profit, not sharing the profit could be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, the problem is the author didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV. The initial agreement was about the first TV. The second one was a bonus. If all three contributed to the original purchase, maybe they should have discussed how to handle the mistake. The author taking it without consulting might be the issue. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the shared ownership of the original purchase and didn't involve the roommates in deciding what to do with the second TV. Even though the order was under their name, the shared expense implies shared responsibility for any additional items that result from that purchase. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
