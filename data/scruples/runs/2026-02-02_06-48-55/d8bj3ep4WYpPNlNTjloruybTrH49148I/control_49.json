We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves roommates and a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. \n\nFirst, the user moved in with two roommates and bought a TV together using Amazon Prime, splitting the cost three ways. When two TVs arrived, the writer kept one and sold the second one. The roommate who tried to buy the second TV got upset when it was sold and demanded a share of the money.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the original TV was ordered under the writer's Amazon account, but the cost was split. The second TV was an accident, and the writer took it as their own. Now, the question is whether the roommates are entitled to a share of the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nThe writer thought the roommates weren't entitled to the money from the second TV. But the roommate argued they should get a portion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the initial purchase: they split the cost. So each paid a third. The original TV was bought as a shared item. The second TV was an error. Since it was an accident, the seller might have intended to send one TV but sent two. So the second TV is essentially a free one. \n\nNow, who owns the second TV? Since the purchase was made using the writer's account, but the cost was split, there's a shared ownership aspect. Even though the writer paid for it via their account, the roommates contributed to the original purchase. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. \n\nWait, the original agreement was that when moving out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV was an unexpected bonus. The writer sold it and kept the money. The roommate who tried to buy it was upset because she thought she was entitled to a share. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the roommates have a claim to the second TV. Since the second TV was a mistake, the ownership isn't clear. If the purchase was made using the writer's account, maybe they have a stronger claim. But since the original purchase was shared, maybe there's an expectation of shared responsibility for any errors? \n\nAlternatively, the error (two TVs sent) might be the seller's mistake, so the second TV belongs to the person whose account was used. The roommates didn't contribute to the cost of the second TV, only the first. So the second one is the writer's to handle? \n\nBut the roommate argued she was entitled to her cut. If the writer didn't discuss the second TV's ownership with the roommates, perhaps they assumed it was shared. The writer's decision to sell it without consulting them might be an issue. \n\nEven if the second TV was the writer's to keep, maybe they should have informed the roommates and discussed it. The fact that one roommate was trying to buy it shows there was an expectation that it could be up for grabs. The writer didn't consider the roommates' potential interest, which led to conflict. \n\nSo, maybe the writer is at fault for not communicating and not considering the roommates' possible claims. Even though the second TV was under their name, since the purchase was a shared expense, there's an argument that the roommates had some stake in the original purchase, and the error might have benefited the group as a whole. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. \n\nAlternatively, the error is the seller's, so the second TV is the writer's to deal with as they see fit. But the roommates might feel entitled because they paid for the original purchase. But since the second TV was free, maybe it's separate. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The writer's actions led to an unspoken assumption that the TV was theirs, but the roommates might have thought any errors would be split. Without a clear agreement, the writer might be in the right for taking it as their own, but the lack of communication and the roommates' expectations could make them partially at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the second TV was the writer's to handle, then no. But if the roommates had a shared interest because of the original purchase, then maybe yes. However, the original purchase was split, but the second TV was an accident not part of that split. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the second TV wasn't part of the shared expense. The writer paid for the original TV, and the second was an error, so they have the right to it. The roommates weren't entitled to the second TV's proceeds. The writer's mistake was not communicating, but not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
