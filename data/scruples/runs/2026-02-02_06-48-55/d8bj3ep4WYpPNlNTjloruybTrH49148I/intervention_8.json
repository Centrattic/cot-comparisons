We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their shared house.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime, which had a discount. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. On delivery day, Amazon sent two TVs. The author thought the second one was theirs and sold it, not considering the roommates. One roommate kept trying to buy it but was rejected, and when the author sold it without consulting them, the roommate got upset and demanded a share of the money.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The initial agreement was about splitting the cost and the eventual profits. The second TV was an accident by Amazon. The author took possession of it and sold it without discussing it with the roommates. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even though the author ordered the TV and paid for it through their account, the initial purchase was a joint decision among three people. The second TV might have been a mistake, but it came as a result of the original order. The roommates contributed to the cost, so they might feel entitled to a share of any surplus. The author didn't consult them, even though the original agreement mentioned splitting profits when moving out. The second TV's ownership wasn't discussed, but it's related to the original purchase. \n\nThe author might argue that the second TV was an unexpected bonus and that since they ordered it, it was theirs to sell. However, the roommates' contributions to the original purchase could imply shared responsibility or rights over any additional items resulting from that purchase. The author's assumption that the second TV was theirs might not have considered the roommates' expectations, especially since the original agreement mentioned splitting profits. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate the existence of the second TV with their roommates before selling it, leading to a conflict. The roommate's entitlement to a share of the money might stem from the initial shared purchase and the unspoken assumption that any unforeseen gains would be shared as well. The author should have discussed the second TV with all roommates to reach a mutual agreement.\n"
