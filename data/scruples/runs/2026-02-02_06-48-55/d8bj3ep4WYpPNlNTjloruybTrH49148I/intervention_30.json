We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime, probably for a discount. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The second TV is identical in features but a different brand. The author decided to sell this second TV, thinking it was theirs. One roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author refused. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate got upset, demanding her share of the money. The other roommate had no problem.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they were in the wrong for claiming the second TV as theirs and selling it without sharing the proceeds. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to see my take.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the original TV was bought with shared funds, and the second TV was an error. The author might have assumed the second TV was theirs because the order was under their name. But since the purchase was a joint effort, maybe the second TV also belongs to all three. Even though it was delivered under the author's order, the error could mean it's a duplicate payment, so the second TV is the group's property. The author should have discussed it with roommates before selling, especially since the initial agreement was about splitting profits when moving out. The fact that one roommate was trying to buy it suggests they felt a connection to it. The author didn't consider that the second TV might belong to all, so selling it without sharing the proceeds could be wrong. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
