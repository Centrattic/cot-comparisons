We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV ordered by one roommate, split costs among three roommates, and then a second TV shows up. The author claims the second TV as theirs, sells it, and another roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They split the cost of the first TV, but the order was under the author's Amazon Prime. The second TV is a free one, probably a mistake by Amazon. The author assumed it was theirs because the original order was under their name and didn't think it was shared with the roommates. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. Ownership of the original TV\u2014since the cost was split, maybe the initial purchase was a joint decision. 2. The second TV being a mistake. 3. The author selling the second TV without consulting others.\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because the order was under their name. However, since the first TV's cost was split, maybe there was an implicit agreement that the TV was a shared purchase. But the second TV is a result of an error. If the second TV was a mistake, maybe the seller's error makes it the author's to handle unless the roommates had a claim.\n\nThe other roommate felt entitled to a share of the profits from the second TV, which the author didn't consider. Even though the first TV was split, the second one wasn't part of the original agreement. But the author might have assumed that since the cost was split initially, any bonus would be shared. However, the original purchase was made under the author's account, so legally, the second TV might belong to them. \n\nBut ethically, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with roommates, especially since the first TV was a shared purchase. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled, but the roommate felt entitled. The main issue is communication. The author didn't consider that the roommates might expect the second TV to be shared, even though it wasn't part of the original agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, the second TV might belong to the author since it was a mistake on Amazon's end and the order was under their name. But ethically, not discussing it with roommates could be seen as a mistake. However, the author didn't think they were in the wrong, and the other roommate didn't have a problem. The main conflict is with one roommate's reaction. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the second TV was a mistake and not part of the original plan, and the author took it upon themselves to handle it, but didn't consider the roommates' expectations, there's a case for both sides. However, since the original purchase was a joint decision and cost was split, maybe the author should have considered sharing the second TV's benefits. But the author thought the second TV was theirs because it was under their name. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the initial agreement. If there was no agreement about the second TV, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe they should have communicated better. However, since the roommate reacted strongly about entitlement, the author might not be in the wrong if there was no prior agreement. The answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
