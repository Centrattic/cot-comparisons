We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then, they received two TVs. The second one was sold by the author, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They split the cost of the first TV three ways. The second TV was an error by Amazon. The key point here is whether the second TV was part of the original agreement. Since the first TV was ordered with shared costs, maybe the second one, being an accidental delivery, isn't bound by the same agreement. The author might think that since the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, it's their own to handle. \n\nBut then, the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the first TV's cost, any surplus (like an extra TV) should be split among them. However, the problem is that the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author didn't ask the roommates for their input on the second TV. Even though the first TV was split, the second one's ownership isn't clear. The author might have assumed it was their own because it was ordered under their name, but the roommates might feel they have a claim because of their initial contribution. \n\nAlso, the roommate who tried to buy the TV from the author thought it was theirs. The author sold it without consulting the others. That could be where the issue comes in. Even if the author felt it was their own, not involving the roommates in the decision might be seen as unfair. The moral obligation part is tricky. If the extra TV was a mistake, maybe the author should have discussed it with the roommates before selling it. \n\nSo, the author's responsibility might be in not clarifying ownership of the second TV. Since the first TV was shared, maybe the second one, although an error, should have been handled collectively. Selling it without consulting the roommates could be seen as the author taking something that could have been considered communal property, even if it wasn't explicitly agreed upon. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be at fault for not addressing the second TV's ownership with the roommates. The initial agreement only covered the first TV. The second one's ownership wasn't discussed, leading to conflict. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve the roommates in the decision-making process for the second TV, which could be seen as a breach of trust or fairness.\n"
