We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by claiming a second TV that was mistakenly delivered and then sold it. The key points here are about ownership and prior agreements.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime account, even though the cost was split three ways. The author ordered it because it was discounted through their Prime. The second TV was a free one that came by accident. The roommates agreed that when they move out, they'd split the profits from selling the original TV. But the second TV wasn't part of that agreement.\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered to their address and they ordered the first one. They proposed selling it, and one roommate tried to buy it but was turned down. The author then sold it without consulting the roommates. The problem arises when the roommate demands a share of the money from the second TV, which wasn't part of the original agreement.\n\nOwnership of the second TV is tricky. Since it was a mistake by Amazon, it's unclear if the author actually owns it. But since it was delivered to their address and under their name, they might have a claim. However, sharing a house means shared responsibility. Even though the purchase was under the author's account, the TV was for shared use. The author didn't mention discussing the second TV with the roommates, which could be an oversight.\n\nThe main issue is whether the roommates had any claim to the second TV. The original agreement was about the first TV. The second one was unexpected. The author didn't consider that the roommates might expect a share of any unexpected gains from shared expenses. Even though the author paid for the first TV, the second one's ownership isn't clear. The author should have checked with the roommates before selling it, especially since they were splitting costs. The fact that one roommate was insistent on buying it shows there was an expectation that it might be shared. By selling it without discussing, the author might have breached the trust or unspoken agreement.\n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV. Even if they thought it was theirs, sharing a house implies shared consideration. The answer is A.\n"
