We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was mistakenly delivered to their shared house. The original TV was bought through their Amazon Prime, split the cost three ways, and they agreed to split profits when selling. The second TV had the author's name on it, so they sold it and kept the money. Now, one roommate is upset and demanding a share.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author ordered the TV under their Prime, which included a discount. The house agreed to split costs and profits. The second TV was a free one, same features. The author proposed selling it, thinking it was theirs. The other roommate tried to buy it multiple times but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it, and the angry roommate feels entitled to a portion.\n\nSo, the main issue is ownership of the second TV. The author probably thought since it was ordered under their name and the original cost was split, the second one is also theirs. But maybe the delivery mistake implies it's an error, so the rightful owner might be someone else or the original seller. However, the original cost was split, so maybe the second TV is a mistake by the seller, possibly due to a glitch. The author might have an initial right to it because it was delivered to their account, but ethically, if the original purchase was shared, the mistake might also be shared responsibility.\n\nWait, the original TV was ordered under the author's account but paid for by all three. So if the seller made a mistake and sent another one, the author might have a claim to it as the account holder. But the roommates also contributed to the original purchase. The agreement was that when they move out or sell, they split the profits. If the second TV is a mistake, maybe the author should have shared the windfall. However, the author didn't see it that way, thinking they were just handling the sale. The other roommate was trying to buy it, but the author didn't accept their offers and sold it to someone else. The angry roommate feels entitled because they contributed to the original purchase and it was a mistake. \n\nLegally, if the TV was ordered under the author's Prime and delivered to the address, the author might own it. But ethically, since the original purchase was a joint effort, the mistake could be considered a shared benefit. The author might have been selfish by keeping the profit. The other roommate approached the author directly, which the author took as a sign it was theirs to sell. However, the roommates had an agreement to split costs and profits, so maybe the mistake should have been split as well. The author might be in the wrong for not sharing the free TV's profit, given the initial agreement. So answer A.\n"
