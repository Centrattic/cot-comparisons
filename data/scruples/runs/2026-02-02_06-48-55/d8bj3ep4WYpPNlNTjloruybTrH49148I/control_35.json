We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it. The situation involves roommates.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. The second TV was a free one, probably a mistake. The author thought it was theirs to sell since they ordered the original, but their roommate wanted to buy it and later got upset when the author sold it without sharing the profit.\n\nThe key points here are: Who owns the second TV? The original purchase was shared, but the second one was an accident. Did the roommates have a prior agreement about any extra items? The author didn't consider the roommates when selling, but the other roommate had no issues. The one who tried to buy it was upset about not getting a cut.\n\nOwnership of the second TV is unclear. Since the order was placed by the author under their account, the delivery might have gone to the correct address but with a mistake. The cost was split for the original, but the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might not have realized that the second TV could be a shared asset, especially since it was an error. However, the author acted quickly to sell it without consulting the roommates. Even if the author thought it was theirs, not considering the roommates' perspectives might be a mistake. The roommate's entitlement to a cut depends on whether the second TV was considered a joint purchase. Since the original was split, maybe the second one was also a joint asset, even if it was an accident. The author's failure to discuss it with roommates could lead to conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including roommates in the decision, especially since the cost was shared initially. Answer A.\n"
