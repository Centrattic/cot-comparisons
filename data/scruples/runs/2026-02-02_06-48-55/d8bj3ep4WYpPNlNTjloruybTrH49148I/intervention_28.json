We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered using Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then, Amazon delivered another identical TV for free. The author decided to sell the second TV, which led to conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, the original purchase: they agreed to buy one TV, split the cost three ways. Then, the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The key points here are ownership of the second TV and the agreement between roommates. \n\nThe author ordered the first TV under their Amazon Prime, which might imply they were the one handling the purchase. But the second TV was a mistake\u2014Amazon's error. The author claims the second TV as their own and sells it. The problem arises when the other roommate feels entitled to a share of the proceeds.\n\nThe initial agreement was that when they move out, they would split the profits from selling the original TV. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. Since the second TV was a free item delivered by accident, it's unclear if the roommates had any right to it. However, the fact that the author ordered it under their name might mean they had legal ownership, especially if the purchase was under their account. \n\nBut the author's roommate might argue that since the cost of the first TV was shared, any additional benefits should also be shared. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author might not owe the roommates a share unless there was an agreement to split any additional items. The roommate's anger could stem from a misunderstanding of ownership. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which could be a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author legally owned the second TV, sharing the proceeds might have been considerate. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong. Legally, if the TV was delivered to a shared address under the author's account, they might have the right to it. Ethically, if the roommates expected shared ownership of any purchases for communal items, there might be an issue. However, the original agreement was only about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement, so the author might not be in the wrong. The roommate's expectation might be unreasonable unless there was a prior agreement covering such scenarios.\n"
