We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake. The key points here are about ownership and agreement.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime account, even though the cost was split three ways. That's important because the purchase was made in the author's name. The second TV, which was a free one, was delivered by accident. The author decided to sell it, and only one roommate tried to buy it. Then the author sold it and the other roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nNow, looking at the agreements they had. They agreed that when they move out, they would sell the original TV and split the profits. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author didn't mention the second TV in their initial plan. So, the question is, does the second TV fall under the same agreement as the first? Since it was a mistake, maybe it's considered the author's property since it was delivered to their address and under their name. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so they might not have a claim on it.\n\nThe roommate who was upset felt entitled because they split the original cost, but the second TV was a free item that the author received due to a delivery error. The author didn't owe the roommates a share of the second TV's sale because there was no prior agreement about it. The other roommate had no issues, which suggests that the disagreement is primarily with the one who tried to buy it and then got upset when they couldn't.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they handled the second TV as their own, given that it was their purchase and the mistake wasn't their fault. The roommates didn't have a claim unless they had an agreement, which they didn't.\n"
