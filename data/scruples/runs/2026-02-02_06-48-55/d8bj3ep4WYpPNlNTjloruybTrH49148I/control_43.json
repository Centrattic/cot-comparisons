We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me walk through the scenario step by step.\n\nSo, the author moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, which had a discount. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one is a different brand but same specs. The author wanted to sell the extra TV, and another roommate kept trying to buy it from them but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else. The roommate found out and got angry, demanding her cut. The other roommate didn't mind.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault for taking the second TV and not sharing the proceeds. They argue that since the original TV was ordered under their name and the roommate approached them about buying the extra one, they had no obligation to split the money.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the ownership of the second TV. The main question is whether the second TV was considered communal property or the author's personal item. The original TV was bought with shared funds, so it's probably communal. But the second TV was an accident. Since the author ordered the original, maybe the second one was also under their name. The roommates might have assumed any extra items delivered would be shared. However, the author didn't consult them and took the initiative to sell it without involving them. Even though the roommate approached the author, the fact that there was an agreement about the original TV's profits might have extended to the extra one. The author might have failed to consider that the second TV, being part of the same order, could be considered communal property too. Therefore, selling it without discussion might have been a mistake. The author could owe the roommates a share since the order was for the shared TV. Even if it was a mistake, splitting the proceeds might be fair. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
