We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who claimed the second TV is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates sharing a house and splitting the cost of a TV. The main issue is that an extra TV was delivered, and the person who ordered it took it and sold it without sharing the profit with all the roommates.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased under the author's Amazon Prime with a discount. They split the cost three ways, so each roommate contributed equally. The agreement was to sell the TV when they move out and split the profits. Now, when a second TV arrives, the question is ownership of that second unit.\n\nThe key points here are the ownership of the second TV. Since the order was placed under the author's name, but the cost was split, it might be considered a shared purchase. However, the delivery of an extra item complicates things. The author assumed they could sell the second TV and didn't share the proceeds. The roommate who tried to buy it first felt entitled to a share of the money, but the author didn't think they were obligated.\n\nLegally, if the second TV was a mistake by the seller, the author might have a right to keep the proceeds if they sold it. However, since the purchase was a joint effort with shared funds, maybe there's an expectation that any additional assets from the purchase should be shared. The fact that one roommate was upset about not getting a cut suggests there's an expectation of shared ownership.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the first TV was under their name, and the second was a bonus. If the second TV was a mistake, it's unclear if the roommates intended to split the cost of that as well. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which could be a point of contention. Even though the original agreement was about selling the first TV, the second one wasn't discussed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing the proceeds might have been fairer. The author thought they were doing a nice thing by selling the second TV, but the other roommate felt entitled. The author's decision not to share might be seen as inconsiderate, even if not legally wrong. The fact that one roommate was insistent on buying it from them indicates there was interest in sharing the asset.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the roommates' potential claims to the second TV, even if the original agreement only covered the first one. The shared purchase of the first TV and the unexpected second might have created an implied shared ownership of any additional assets from that purchase.\n"
