We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for taking the second TV that was accidentally delivered and selling it without splitting the proceeds with their roommate.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person moved in with two roommates and they all agreed to buy a TV using their Amazon Prime account, which was the user's. They split the cost three ways. When two TVs were delivered, the user decided to sell the second one. The roommate wanted to buy it but the user sold it to someone else. Then the roommate got angry when she found out and demanded a portion of the money, which the user didn't give.\n\nThe user argues that the original TV was bought under their name, and the second one was a mistake. They thought they could handle it themselves. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the user have the right to claim the second TV as their own? The order was made under their Amazon account, but it was a shared expense. The free TV was a result of an error, but since it was a joint purchase, maybe the free one should belong to all three. The user's roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the cost of the original TV. \n\nThe user sold the second TV without consulting everyone, which the roommate took as taking sole ownership. Even though the user didn't split the cost of the second TV (since it was free), the original purchase was a shared expense. If the error was due to the seller's mistake, the user might have been supposed to return it. However, in this case, the user kept it, which could be seen as keeping a mistake. If the mistake was due to the seller, the user might be expected to return the extra TV or split the proceeds. \n\nThe roommates contributed to the original purchase, so the free TV could be considered a shared asset. The user's action of selling it without consulting everyone might be seen as taking advantage of their position as the one who ordered it. The other roommate's insistence on buying it suggests that there was a shared expectation of ownership. \n\nIn summary, even though the order was under the user's name, since the purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might be considered jointly owned. Therefore, selling it without consensus could be in the user's wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the user is in the wrong).\n"
