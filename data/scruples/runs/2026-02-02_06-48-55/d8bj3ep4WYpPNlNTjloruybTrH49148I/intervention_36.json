We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered, which they sold and kept the money, with one roommate upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, the setup: They moved into a house with two roommates, bought a TV together, split the cost. The author used their Amazon account, but all three chipped in. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author thought the second one was theirs and sold it, while another roommate wanted to buy it. After selling, the roommate got upset and demanded a share of the profit.\n\nSo, the main question is ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime with a discount. But the cost was split three ways. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author assumed it was theirs and sold it, but the roommate felt entitled to a share.\n\nNow, considering that the original purchase was a joint decision with shared payment, even though ordered under the author's account, the ownership might be a joint effort. The second TV, being an error, might be considered the property of the person whose account was used, but the roommate's argument is that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim on the accidental delivery.\n\nThe author thought they could claim the second TV as their own because it was under their name. However, the shared living arrangement and shared initial purchase might imply that any additional items resulting from that purchase should be considered communal. The author didn't consult the roommates before selling it. The fact that one roommate tried to buy it could also indicate they had some expectation of ownership or at least a right to purchase it.\n\nThe key points are: shared cost, shared ownership of the original TV, accidental delivery of another. The author's quick decision to sell without consensus might be the issue. The roommate's claim is based on their contribution to the original purchase and the expectation that the error would benefit the group. The author's action of selling it without sharing the proceeds could be seen as unfair, especially since the money came from an error that might have been intended for the original buyers.\n\nBut on the other hand, the original purchase was under the author's account, and the second TV's delivery might have been a mistake on Amazon's part, leading to the author being the de facto owner until they decided otherwise. If the author didn't discuss the second TV with the roommates, that's where the problem arises. The roommates might have felt entitled to it because they contributed to the original purchase, even if the delivery was an error.\n\nSo, maybe the author wasn't wrong to sell it but should have shared the profit since the initial purchase was a shared expense. The confusion here is whether the accidental delivery of the second TV is a separate transaction. If the error was Amazon's, the ownership might lie with the person whose account was used, but the shared nature of the original purchase complicates it. The author might have assumed they had the right since they ordered it, but the roommates might have felt they had a stake in it because they paid their share for the original. Therefore, the author should have considered splitting the proceeds from the second TV, even if the ownership was unclear. Not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate or unfair, hence the roommate's anger. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being in the wrong (A).\n"
