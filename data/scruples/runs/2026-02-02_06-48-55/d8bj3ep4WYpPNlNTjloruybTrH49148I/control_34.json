We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The author bought the first TV using their Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two roommates. Then, a second TV showed up, and the author sold it, leading to conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is whether the author had the right to claim the second TV. The TV was ordered under the author's account, but they split the cost with roommates. The second TV was a mistake, so it wasn't supposed to be there. The author thought they could sell it since it was their name on the order, but the roommate felt entitled to a share of the proceeds.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that the second TV was a mistake, and since they were the one who ordered it (even though the cost was split), they believed they had the right to handle it. The roommate, however, felt it was a shared purchase, hence her claim to a portion of the money. \n\nI need to consider the initial agreement. The roommates agreed that when they move out, they would split the profits from selling the TV. But that was for the original TV. The second TV was an error, so maybe it's not part of that agreement. The author might not have considered that the mistake might imply the second TV wasn't part of their purchase. However, the cost of the original TV was split, so maybe the second TV, being a mistake, was an unexpected expense or windfall. \n\nThe author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, which led to conflict. The key question is: does the original agreement about splitting costs and profits extend to the second TV? If the second TV was a mistake, perhaps it wasn't part of the original purchase, so the author could claim it. But if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a claim to any additional items, even if it was a mistake. \n\nAnother angle is that the author ordered the TV under their own account. So, legally, the item is their responsibility. However, since they shared the cost with roommates, there might be a shared ownership in the original TV, but the second TV being a mistake complicates it. The author might not have had the legal right to the second TV, but morally, if it was a mistake, perhaps it's up to the owner (the author) to decide. However, the roommates might feel since they contributed to the original purchase, any mistake leading to an extra item should be shared. \n\nThe author's roommate was trying to buy the TV from them, which implies she thought it was the author's to sell. The author sold it without consulting them, leading to resentment. The other roommate had no issues, so maybe there's a difference in expectations. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't discuss the second TV with the roommates and sold it without their input, maybe they should have considered that the roommates might expect a share since they contributed to the original purchase. Even though the TV was a mistake, the fact that the cost was split might create an expectation of shared ownership in any related items. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might have thought it was their own to handle, but the roommate's entitlement could stem from feeling that since they helped pay for the original, they should also benefit from any mistakes. \n\nAlternatively, since the second TV was a mistake and the author was the one who ordered it, it's their responsibility to handle it. The roommates didn't pay for the second TV, so the author might not owe them anything from its sale. However, the initial cost was split, so maybe the second TV's value could be considered a windfall that should be shared. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the roommates' contribution to the original purchase gives them a claim to the second TV. If the second TV is a separate item, not part of the original purchase, the author might be justified in keeping the proceeds. But if the mistake was due to the original order, maybe the roommates have a claim. \n\nIn the end, the author didn't consider the roommates' potential entitlement, leading to conflict. Even if they thought they were right, not discussing it might be a mistake. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their roommates' contributions and expectations, even if the TV was a mistake. Or B (not in the wrong) because the TV was their order and they handled it as they saw fit.\n"
