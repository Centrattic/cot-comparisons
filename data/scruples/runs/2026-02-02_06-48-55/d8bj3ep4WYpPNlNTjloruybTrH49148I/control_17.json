We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person and their two roommates bought a TV together, split the cost three ways. The person ordered it using their Amazon Prime. Then,Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one was a different brand but same specs. The author thought they could claim the second TV since it was their name on the order, sold it, and now one roommate is upset and wants a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements. The original agreement was that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split profits. But the second TV came as a mistake. The author thought it was theirs to handle because they ordered it. But maybe the roommates had a right to it too since they contributed to the original purchase?\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways. So the initial cost was shared. The second TV was an error, but it's unclear if the error was on Amazon's part. Maybe the second TV wasn't part of their order. The author ordered the first one, but the second one was sent by mistake. If that's the case, then the second TV might not belong to any of them. The author might have the right to it since they paid for the first one, but the roommates might argue that since they all paid for the first one, the second should be split.\n\nBut the author says they ordered it under their Amazon Prime because it was discounted. So the initial cost was covered by the author's account, but the roommates paid their share. Wait, the author ordered it but the cost was split. So maybe the ownership of the first TV is shared, and the second one is also part of that shared ownership? Or is the second TV a separate item?\n\nThe problem is that the second TV was a mistake. The author might not have intended to purchase it. So if Amazon made an error, the second TV might not belong to them. However, once they accepted it, maybe they became the owner. The roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, any additional items received should be shared.\n\nThe author sold the second TV and didn't share the proceeds. The roommate is upset because she feels entitled. The key here is whether the second TV is considered part of the original purchase. Since it was delivered by mistake, maybe it's the author's to handle because it was their account, but others might argue that since the original purchase was a shared expense, the error applies to all.\n\nAlternatively, since the author used their own Amazon account, perhaps they have the right to the second TV as an error on Amazon's part. But the roommates might not agree, especially if they felt the error was due to the shared order. However, the original purchase was split, so maybe the error is on the author's account, so the second TV belongs to them.\n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates' possible claims, but maybe they had no obligation because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The roommate who tried to buy it was approaching the author directly, leading the author to think it was their TV. So if the author sold it without consulting the others, maybe they were wrong. But if the second TV was a mistake, maybe it's their property to handle.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the wrong if the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase, but if it was an error and the author's account received it, maybe not. The main issue is whether the roommates had a right to the second TV. The answer depends on ownership of the original item and the error. If the second TV was a mistake, perhaps the author can keep the proceeds. But since the original purchase was shared, maybe the error applies to all, so the second TV should be shared too.\n"
