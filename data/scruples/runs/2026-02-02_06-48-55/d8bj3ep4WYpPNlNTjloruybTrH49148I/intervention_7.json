We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The original purchase was split among three roommates, ordered under the author's Amazon account. When a second identical TV arrived, the author decided to sell it, and later gave it away without splitting the proceeds.\n\nFirst, the TV was bought collectively, so ownership might be shared. Even though the author ordered it under their Prime, the cost was split. So the second TV, being an error, might also be considered communal property. The author didn't consult the roommates before selling it, which could be an issue.\n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it was making offers, but the author declined and sold it to someone else. Then, when the roommate found out, she felt entitled to a share. The author didn't share the money, leading to conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author had the right to the second TV. Since the initial purchase was shared, maybe the error benefit should also be shared. The author's assumption that the TV was theirs alone might be incorrect. Not discussing with roommates before selling could be seen as unfair. The other roommate had no problem, but that doesn't mean the author was right.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the free TV was a shared benefit. Even if they ordered it, the cost was split, so the unexpected gain should be shared. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
