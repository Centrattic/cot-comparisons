We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV bought by roommates, split the cost, and then a second TV was delivered. The author sold the second TV, claiming it as their own because it was ordered under their Amazon account. The roommate who tried to buy it from them is upset and demands a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original purchase: the TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So even though the order was under the author's name, the financial responsibility was shared. The second TV was an accident, maybe a delivery error. The author decided to sell it, and another roommate tried to buy it, but the author didn't agree. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and that roommate got angry, claiming entitlement.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and agreement. When the original TV was ordered under the author's name, but the cost was split, does that mean the author owns the TV? Or does splitting the cost imply joint ownership? If they all contributed equally, maybe the TV belongs to all of them equally. The second TV, being a free one delivered by accident, probably should have been handled with the roommates as well. The author didn't consult the others before selling it, which could be a problem. The roommate who tried to buy it might have felt that since they contributed to the original purchase, they had a claim to the second TV. \n\nThe author's argument is that they ordered it, so it's theirs. But if the purchase was a joint decision and the cost was shared, maybe the author doesn't have sole claim. The mistake here might be that the author didn't clarify ownership of the original TV first. If they all agreed to split the cost and share the TV, then the second TV, as an error, should be considered communal property. Selling it without consulting the others could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The roommate's entitlement might be based on their contribution to the initial purchase, so the author's refusal to share the proceeds from the second TV's sale could be unjust.\n\nBut then again, the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might have thought they found an extra TV that wasn't their responsibility. However, since it was delivered as part of the order, maybe Amazon's error makes it their responsibility to handle with the others. The author should have discussed with the roommates before selling it. By not doing so, they might have acted unilaterally, which could be considered wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the roommates had a prior agreement about such situations. Since there wasn't a clear agreement, the author's assumption that it was entirely theirs might be the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
