We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake and then selling it without splitting the profits with their roommate. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The person moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, a second TV was delivered accidentally. The author decided to sell the second TV, and another roommate was upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nHmm, the key points here are who owned the second TV. Since the original purchase was split three ways, even though ordered under the author's account, the cost was shared. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. Now, does that second TV belong to the author or is it jointly owned by all three roommates?\n\nWait, the initial agreement was that when they moved out, they would split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author assumed they could take it because it was delivered under their name. But maybe the fact that they paid a third of the original cost means they have some claim to the second TV as well?\n\nThe problem is that the second TV's delivery was an error. The author didn't pay for it, but since the original order was under their account, maybe the second TV was a duplicate sent by mistake. But if the cost was split three ways, the second TV's cost might have been covered by the original payment? Not sure. Amazon might have charged for the second TV, but the roommates might not have paid for that.\n\nThe author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. The other roommate was upset because they felt entitled to a portion. The author didn't think they were entitled. The question is about ownership. If the second TV was sent by Amazon as an error, does the ownership belong to the person whose account it was ordered under, or to all roommates since they contributed to the original purchase?\n\nAlso, the original purchase was a shared decision. They split the cost, so maybe the second TV, even though delivered as an error, is considered a shared asset. The author might have been wrong to sell it without consulting everyone. Even if the order was under their name, the initial purchase was a joint decision. So, maybe the author should have shared the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates, especially since they contributed to the original cost.\n\nBut the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It was an error. The author might argue that they didn't expect to get a second TV for free, so it's theirs to do with as they please. However, since the original purchase was a shared expense, perhaps the second TV is considered an unexpected gain that should be shared equally.\n\nAnother angle: If the second TV was sent by mistake, the author might have had an obligation to return it or at least inform the roommates. Selling it without consulting them could be seen as greedy, especially if the roommates contributed to the original order. Even if the author paid for the original TV out of their own account, the shared nature of the purchase might imply shared ownership of any unexpected gains.\n\nThe roommate's anger comes from feeling entitled to a portion of the money. If the original purchase was split three ways, maybe the second TV's value should also be split three ways. The author didn't consider that, so they might be in the wrong. The other roommate's reaction is based on contributing to the original expense, so they feel the second TV's proceeds should be shared.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. They ordered it under their own account, and the roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost. But if the original purchase was split three ways, perhaps the second TV is considered an unexpected bonus that should be shared. The line here is blurry.\n\nIn similar situations, if a shared expense leads to an unexpected gain, it's usually split among all contributors. The author didn't consider that and took the gain for themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
