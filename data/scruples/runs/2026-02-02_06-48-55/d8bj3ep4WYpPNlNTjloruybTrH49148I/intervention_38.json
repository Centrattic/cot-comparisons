We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their shared house and then selling it. \n\nFirst, the setup: They moved in with two roommates, bought a TV together, split the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. They had an agreement that when they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split profits three ways. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs, and the second one was identical but a different brand. The author decided to sell the second TV, not considering the roommates. One roommate was upset, demanding a cut, while the other was fine.\n\nThe author's defense is that the original TV was under their name, the roommate approached them directly to buy it, and they thought the roommates weren't entitled to the extra TV. They sold it as a nice gesture but didn't consider the others.\n\nSo, the key points here are about ownership and agreements. The original TV was a shared purchase, split costs with roommates. The second TV came as an error. The author took it as their own, but since the purchase was a joint effort, maybe that complicates ownership of the second TV. Even if the order was placed under their Amazon, the cost was split, so perhaps the TV was technically a joint purchase. The second TV would then belong to all three, even if it was an accident. Selling it without consulting the others could be seen as taking it for oneself without considering their rights. The roommate's argument is that they have a claim to the money from the sale since the initial purchase was shared.\n\nThe author might argue that the second TV was an error and they had the right to claim it, especially since it was delivered under their name. But since the original purchase involved shared costs, maybe the second TV is also a shared asset. The agreement was about the original TV, but the second one wasn't part of the original agreement. However, the fact that they were all contributing to the original purchase might imply that any additional TVs resulting from that purchase are also shared. The author might not have thought of that, but since they split the cost, the second TV could be seen as belonging to all three. Selling it without sharing the proceeds could be wrong.\n\nThe roommate who was upset felt entitled because of the shared cost. The author didn't consider that, which might mean they were in the wrong. Even if the second TV was an accident, the original purchase was a joint effort. So the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates. The answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because the shared purchase implies shared ownership of any accidental gains related to that purchase. The author took the second TV's proceeds without considering their roommates' contributions and rights.\n"
