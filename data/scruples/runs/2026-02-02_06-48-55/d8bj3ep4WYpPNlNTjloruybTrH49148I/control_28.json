We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a TV order that accidentally got two units. The author bought the first one under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then the second TV arrived, and they sold it, leading to a conflict with one of the roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon account, but the cost was split three ways. The agreement was that if they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. So the initial purchase was a shared expense.\n\nNow, the second TV was an error by Amazon. The author claims it as their own and sold it. The issue here is whether the second TV is part of the original agreement. Since the second TV wasn't part of the initial purchase, maybe the confusion is about ownership. The author believed it was theirs because it was under their name, but the roommates might argue that since the initial purchase was a shared expense, any additional items resulting from that order (even if accidental) should also be shared.\n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it multiple times might have thought that since the first TV was shared, the second one should be too. But the author didn't consider them entitled. However, the original agreement was about the TV they ordered, not an accidental duplicate. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, so maybe the author had more right to it. But there's a gray area here because the initial order was a joint decision.\n\nAlso, the roommate felt entitled to a portion of the sale money, which the author didn't share. The question is whether the second TV's value should be considered part of the shared asset or the author's personal gain. Since the second TV was an error, the author might have a claim to it, especially if they were the one who ordered it. However, since the initial purchase was a shared expense, there might be an expectation that any related items (even accidental) are shared.\n\nThe author sold it without consulting the roommates, which could be a problem. Even if the second TV was technically theirs, not discussing it with everyone involved might have been a mistake. The roommates might feel that since the first TV was a shared purchase, the second one should also be handled collectively.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the original agreement. If the agreement was strictly about the TV they ordered, then the second one is separate. But if the roommates expected any additional items to be shared, then the author might be at fault for not considering that. The key point is whether the second TV was part of the original joint purchase. Since it was an error, the author's name was on the order, so they might have had the right to it. However, not involving the roommates in the decision to sell it could be where the author went wrong. The author didn't consider the roommates' feelings or the shared nature of the initial purchase, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and assumed ownership without considering the shared context.\n"
