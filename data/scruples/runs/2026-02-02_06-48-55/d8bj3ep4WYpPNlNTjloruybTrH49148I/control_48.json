We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The key points here are about ownership, agreement among roommates, and how the situation was handled.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. They had an agreement that when they move out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. Then, a second TV was delivered by mistake. The author took it upon themselves to sell this second TV, not considering the roommates' potential claims. \n\nThe roommate who tried to buy the TV thought it was the author's, and the author didn't consider her entitlement to a share. The other roommate didn't have an issue, but the main conflict is with the one who got upset.\n\nNow, legally, if the TV was delivered to the shared address and the author's name was on it, they might have a claim. But since it was a mistake, maybe it's the seller's responsibility. However, ethically, the roommates paid a third each for the original TV, so maybe the free TV should be considered as a shared asset? The author didn't think to split the profits from the second TV, which the roommate is now claiming.\n\nThe author's defense is that the original purchase was under their name and they didn't think the roommates were entitled to the second TV. But since the original cost was split, the roommates might feel they have a right to benefit from the error. The author sold the second TV without discussing it, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, was there an agreement about the second TV? The initial agreement was about the original TV. The second one wasn't discussed. The author assumed ownership based on the name on the order, but since the purchase was a group decision, maybe the roommates had a shared interest. The author might have been wrong to not consider the roommates' potential claims, especially since they contributed to the original purchase. Therefore, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because they didn't consider the roommates' shared investment and didn't discuss the second TV's handling.\n"
