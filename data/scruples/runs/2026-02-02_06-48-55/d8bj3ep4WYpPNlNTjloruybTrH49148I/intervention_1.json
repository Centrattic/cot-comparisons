We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it. The situation involves roommates who split the cost of the original TV, which was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime.\n\nFirst, the key points: The original TV was bought with three roommates splitting the cost. The second TV appeared, same model, and the author decided to sell it. The other roommate wanted to buy it but the author didn't accept, then sold it elsewhere. The roommate got upset and demanded a share of the profits. The author didn't think they were entitled to a share, but the question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the second TV belongs to the author alone or is a shared purchase. The original TV was split costs, but the second one was an accident. The author ordered it under their Amazon account, so maybe they have a claim. However, since they were splitting costs for the original, perhaps the second one's ownership is unclear.\n\nThe author thought it was theirs to sell. But if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they had an expectation that any additional TVs related to the original purchase would be shared? Or is the second TV entirely the author's because it was an error and not ordered by others?\n\nAnother angle: The original purchase was for a shared item, so maybe the second TV, even though it was a mistake, is part of the shared purchase? But since it was a mistake, maybe the author didn't intend to buy two. However, since they received it, they might be responsible for dealing with it. But how does splitting costs affect this? If the original was split three ways, but the second one wasn't ordered by anyone else, maybe the author is the only one responsible for the second one. But the roommates might argue that since the original was shared, any extras should be divided or discussed.\n\nThe author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. They just assumed it was theirs. The roommate wanted to buy it, but the author refused and sold it. The other roommate didn't have issues. But the one who tried to buy it felt entitled to a share. The author's reasoning is that the original purchase was under their name, so the second TV was theirs. But the cost was split, so maybe there's an implied shared ownership in the original TV, but the second one is separate? Or maybe the error makes the second TV the author's to handle as they see fit since they were the ones who ordered it, even though the cost was split?\n\nI think the crux is whether the second TV is considered part of the shared purchase. If the roommates contributed to the original TV's cost, perhaps they would reasonably expect any surplus (like the second one) to be handled jointly. The author didn't consider their entitlement, which might be where they went wrong. Even if the author ordered it, the initial purchase was a shared expense. So the second TV might be considered a shared asset because the original was shared. Therefore, the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates before selling it, especially since the original was a joint purchase.\n\nAlternatively, since the second TV was an error and not part of the original order, maybe it's entirely the author's to handle. But the fact that the original was split might complicate things. It's possible the roommates would have a claim to the second TV as a mistake in the order that they all contributed to. The author might have been wrong to not involve them in the decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting and for assuming sole ownership of the second TV, even though it was under their name. The roommates might have a reasonable claim to a share, especially since the original purchase was a shared expense. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
