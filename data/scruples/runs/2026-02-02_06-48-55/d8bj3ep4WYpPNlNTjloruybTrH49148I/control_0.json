  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was accidentally delivered twice when they ordered one. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime and split the cost with two roommates. When a second TV arrived, they decided to sell it. One roommate wanted to buy it but the author didn't sell. Eventually, the author sold it and kept the money, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who owns the second TV. The original purchase was split three ways, so maybe all three have a claim. But the TV was ordered under the author's account. However, since it was a shared expense, maybe the second TV is also a joint purchase? The fact that the delivery happened after moving in together complicates things.\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was ordered under their name, but if the cost was split, perhaps the roommates have a right to it. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which might be a mistake. Even if it was under their name, since the initial purchase was shared, the accidental second TV might be considered a shared benefit. The roommate who tried to buy it thought they had a claim, but the author didn't agree. When the author sold it without consulting, the angry roommate felt entitled to a share. \n\nThe key points are: was the second TV part of the original agreement? Since they split the cost, maybe the second TV is an unexpected gain that should be split. The author's assumption that they could handle it alone might be the issue. Even though the order was under them, the shared expense could imply shared ownership of any windfall. The author didn't consider their roommates' potential claim, leading to the conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the roommates' possible entitlement to the second TV's proceeds.\n"
