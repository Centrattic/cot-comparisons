We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the person moved into a house with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The second one is a different brand but same specs. The person decided to sell the second TV, thinking it was theirs. One roommate wanted to buy it but was turned down, then the person sold it to someone else. The roommate got upset, demanding her share of the money. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe key points here are: the original TV was ordered by the person with their Amazon account. The second TV was a mistake. The person didn't consult the roommates about the second TV but assumed it was theirs. The roommate felt entitled to a share, but the person didn't think they were.\n\nNow, considering ownership. The original purchase was split three ways, so maybe the ownership is shared. But the second TV was an error. If it arrived at their house, maybe the responsibility for that TV is unclear. The person might have thought since it was their account, it was their property. But since they paid for the original TV collectively, perhaps the second one should be considered jointly owned as well? Or since the mistake was on Amazon's part, maybe the person has to handle it, but the roommates had a right to share in any gains from an unexpected item bought with shared funds?\n\nWait, the original TV was paid for by all three roommates. The second TV was an error. But the person might be the only one who actually ordered it. But since the original was ordered under their account, maybe the second one was a duplicate from their order, but paid for by all three? Or was the second TV a separate shipment? Maybe the person didn't realize that the second TV was an error and thought they were getting a free one, but actually, Amazon sent two. If the person is the one who ordered the TV under their Prime account, maybe they have legal ownership unless the roommates had a say in the purchase.\n\nBut the roommates had split the cost. So if the original TV was co-owned, then any errors or duplicates might be the responsibility of the person who ordered it. So maybe the person has to deal with the mistake, return the second TV, or share the proceeds if they sell it. Because the mistake was their error in placing the order, even though the cost was split. The roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, any mistakes related to it should be shared responsibility. But the person might argue that since they ordered it, they have control over any errors related to their own order.\n\nAlternatively, if the second TV was a mistake from Amazon, then maybe the person has to return it, but since they sold it, that's a problem. Maybe the roommates have a claim to the proceeds because they contributed to the original purchase. The original agreement was to split profits from selling the TV when moving out. However, the second TV was an error. The person might not have considered that the roommates had a right to any unexpected gains from the original purchase. Since they all paid for the original TV, perhaps they should have discussed the second TV together, not just decided to sell it on their own.\n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, even though they ordered it. The roommates might have a claim to the proceeds because the original TV was a shared purchase. The person should have shared any unexpected gains from the original purchase. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
