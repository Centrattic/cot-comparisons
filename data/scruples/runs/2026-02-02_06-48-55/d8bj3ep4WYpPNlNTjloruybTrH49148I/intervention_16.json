We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then selling it. The original TV was ordered by the author under their Amazon Prime, but they split the cost with two roommates. Then, when a second TV arrived, the author sold it without consulting the others, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The author ordered the TV under their name but said they were splitting the costs three ways. That part seems okay because they shared the expense. But when the second TV came, it's a free replacement or duplicate. The key here is whether the second TV was actually the author's property or if it belonged to everyone.\n\nThe author thought they could claim the second TV as their own since it was delivered to their name, but maybe they should have considered that since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might also be considered a shared asset. Even though it was delivered under the author's name, the fact that the cost was split might mean that the roommates have a claim to the second TV as well.\n\nThe author didn't consult the roommates before selling the TV, which could be a mistake. Even if the original TV was in the author's name, the second TV was a result of the shared purchase. The roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the original cost. The author's decision to sell it without involving them led to conflict, especially since one roommate tried to buy it multiple times and was then upset when it was sold.\n\nAlso, the author assumed the roommates weren't entitled to the money from the sale, but if the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might be considered a shared asset too. The roommates could argue that they should have a share in the proceeds from the second TV's sale because they contributed to the original purchase price.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include the roommates in the decision about the second TV. Even if the original TV was in their name, the shared cost implies that the roommates had a stake in the purchase. The second TV, being a duplicate, might have been considered a shared asset as well, so selling it without consulting them was a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
