We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they bought a TV with roommates, split the cost, and then Amazon sent an extra one. The author sold the second TV, and one roommate got upset because she thought she was entitled to a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV purchase was split among three roommates, so each paid a third. The second TV was a mistake, but it had the author's name on the order. The author decided to sell it, and the roommate kept trying to buy it from them, which they refused. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate was angry about not getting a cut.\n\nThe key points here are about ownership of the second TV. Since the original purchase was split costs, but the order was under the author's Amazon account, does that mean the author owns both TVs? Or does the mistake in delivery affect ownership? If the second TV was a mistake, maybe the author could have returned it, but they chose to sell it. \n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates when selling it. The initial agreement was about the original TV\u2014selling it when they move out and splitting the profits. But the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. However, since the cost was split for the original purchase, maybe the second TV's value should be shared as well? Or is the second TV a separate entity since it was a mistake?\n\nThe roommate who got angry probably felt that since they contributed to the original purchase, any extra value (like the second TV) should be split. The author might not have considered that the mistake could be their fault, but the original order was correct. However, if the delivery of two TVs was a mistake, maybe the author should have checked with roommates before selling it. \n\nBut the author thought it was theirs to sell because it was under their name. The other roommate had no issues, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the angry roommate's entitlement suggests a possible expectation of shared ownership of any mistake benefits. \n\nIn the end, the author didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV. Even though the order was under their name, the original cost was shared. So maybe the author should have discussed the second TV's handling with the roommates, leading to a split of the proceeds. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the roommates' contributions and possible expectations.\n"
