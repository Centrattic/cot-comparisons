We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two others. Then Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The roommate took the second one, tried to sell it, and when they finally sold it, one of the roommates got upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. So the initial purchase was a shared expense. The second TV is a mistake\u2014probably an error in shipping, maybe a duplicate or a wrong item. The author takes possession of the second TV, thinking it's their own because it was under their account. The other roommate keeps trying to buy it from them, but the author sells it to someone else. The angry roommate feels entitled to a portion of the proceeds, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Who owns the second TV? Was the author right to claim it? Did the roommates have a shared ownership right from the start? The original purchase was split three ways, so maybe the second TV, being a duplicate, also belongs to all three? But since the author ordered it under their account, maybe they have a claim.\n\nBut usually, when you split the cost of an item, even if one person places the order, the item is considered jointly owned. So the second TV, being an accidental delivery, might be considered a joint purchase as well. But the author didn't have to pay for the second one, right? The initial cost was split, but the second one was free. So maybe the second TV is the author's since they didn't pay for it and it was delivered under their account.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that since the original TV was split, the second TV was also part of that agreement. But the problem is the second TV wasn't paid for by anyone else. The roommates might have thought that since they split the original cost, they'd also have to split the cost of the second one if it was intentional. But since it was an accident, the author had the option to return it or keep it. The author sold the second TV, which they didn't have to pay for, and kept the money. The other roommate felt entitled to her share, but since she didn't contribute to the second TV's purchase (it was free), maybe she isn't entitled to it. \n\nWait, but the second TV was a result of the same order? Or was it a separate order? The author says they ordered one TV under their Amazon Prime and got two. So the second TV was an error. The author might have a right to keep it since it was their account, but the roommates might expect that since the original was shared, any duplicates would be as well. However, in the original agreement, they said that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. The second TV wasn't part of that original purchase\u2014it was a free replacement. So maybe the author isn't obligated to split the proceeds from the second TV because it wasn't a shared expense. \n\nBut the roommates might argue that since the TV is for the living room, it's communal. However, the original purchase was split, but the second one was an accident. The author acted quickly to sell it, thinking it was their own. The other roommate was trying to buy it from them multiple times, which could imply that the author had the authority to sell. The angry roommate didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so she might not be entitled to it. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the second TV was an error on Amazon's part and wasn't a shared expense. The proceeds from the second TV would then belong to the author since they didn't have to pay for it. The roommate's entitlement to a portion is unfounded unless they had prior agreement on the second TV. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
