We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV ordered under their Amazon account, split costs with roommates, and then a second TV showed up. The person sold the second TV and now one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon. The cost was split three ways, but the purchase was made by the author. The second TV was an error from Amazon. Now, the author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the second TV. Since the first TV was purchased under the author's account, maybe the second was a mistake by Amazon. But when a mistake happens, sometimes the company sends the correct item again, but here it's a different brand but identical. The author might have the right to keep it, but since the cost was split, maybe the roommates have a claim?\n\nWait, the problem is that the cost was split, but the purchase was made by the author. So the initial TV was a shared purchase, but the second one was an error. The author sold the second TV, thinking it was theirs. The other roommate is now upset because they think they deserve a share of the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nBut the original agreement was that when they move out, they would split the profits from selling the original TV. But the second TV came as a bonus. Did the roommates have any claim to the second TV? Since the author paid for the first one, maybe the second is their property. However, since the cost was split, maybe the roommates contributed to the order, so they have a share in the purchase. But the second TV is a free one from Amazon's error, so maybe it's the author's to handle?\n\nThe roommate is angry because she thinks she's entitled to a portion of the money from the second TV. But the author didn't sell the original one. The original was split, but the second was an error. The author might be in the right because they paid for the original, but the roommates contributed to the cost. However, if the roommates were part of the purchase decision, maybe they have a claim on the second TV as well. \n\nBut the second TV was an error. The author might have the right to keep it since it was sent to their account. However, since the author lives in a shared house, maybe the roommates expected that any purchases made together would be shared. The author didn't consult them about the second TV. So maybe the author should have discussed it with the roommates instead of assuming it was theirs. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's roommates contributed to the cost, then maybe they have a claim to the second TV as well. Even though it was a mistake, the cost was shared. Alternatively, the author paid for the original TV, so the second one is a mistake on Amazon's part, and the author can keep it. But the roommates might feel that since they split the cost, they have some ownership over the order, hence the second TV.\n\nIn the end, the author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, leading to conflict. The author might be at fault for not communicating and considering the roommates' potential claim, even if they didn't think they were entitled. The decision to sell without discussion could be where the author went wrong.\n"
