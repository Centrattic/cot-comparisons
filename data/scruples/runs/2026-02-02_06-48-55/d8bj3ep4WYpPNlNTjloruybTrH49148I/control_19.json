We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they bought a TV with two roommates, split the cost. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same specs. The author sold the second TV, and a roommate got mad because they wanted a cut of the money.\n\nFirst, the original purchase: the author bought the TV using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So the initial assumption is that the TV was a shared purchase. When the second TV arrived, it's unclear who it was intended for. The author thought it was theirs, maybe because the original order was under their name, and sold it. The roommate wanted to buy it and was upset when it was sold without their input. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the second TV. Since the first TV was a shared purchase, the second one might not be the author's to claim. Even though the order was under the author's account, the payment was split, so perhaps the TV was a joint purchase. If the second TV was a mistake, maybe it should have been discussed among all roommates before selling. The author didn't consider the roommates when selling the second TV, which led to conflict. \n\nThe roommate felt entitled to a portion of the money, but if the second TV wasn't part of their original agreement, maybe the author had the right to it. However, since the original purchase was shared, maybe the second TV is also shared property. The author might have assumed it was theirs because of the order, but the roommates might argue they all contributed to the original purchase, so the second one is also shared. \n\nIn that case, the author should have discussed the second TV with all roommates before selling it. By selling it unilaterally and keeping the money, they might be in the wrong. The roommate's anger is because they felt their contribution to the original purchase entitled them to a share. The author's mistake was not clarifying the ownership of the second TV and selling it without consensus.\n"
