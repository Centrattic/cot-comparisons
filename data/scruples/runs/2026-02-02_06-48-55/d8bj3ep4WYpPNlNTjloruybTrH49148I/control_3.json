We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house with their name on it.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates split the cost of a TV ordered by the author under their Amazon Prime. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one is the same model but a different brand. The author thought they could sell the extra TV themselves, which they did, and now one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nThe key points here are: the original TV was paid for by all three, the second TV was an error. The author ordered the first TV under their account. The second TV was a free one from Amazon's mistake. The author sold it without consulting the roommates. The main issue is whether the second TV's proceeds should be shared.\n\nThe roommates split the cost of the first TV, so maybe they all have a stake in the overall purchase. However, the second TV was an error, not part of their original agreement. The author might have a claim to it since it was their name on the order. But since the cost was split, maybe the profit from the second TV should be shared? The author didn't think they were entitled to the money, but the roommate felt entitled. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nSo, the question is about ownership of the free TV. If the TV was a result of the purchase, even if not part of the original agreement, since the cost was shared, maybe the profit should be split. However, the second TV was an error, so the author might have a stronger claim to it as it was their order. But since they used their Amazon account, which might be personal, but the purchase was shared. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe author didn't consult the roommates, which could be a problem. Even if they thought it was theirs, involving others in the decision might have been better. The roommate's reaction is about entitlement, but if the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, since the first TV's cost was split, the second TV's profit might be considered communal. Alternatively, the error is Amazon's, so the author is entitled to the free item. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the second TV is considered part of the shared purchase. Since it was a free item resulting from an error, and the author's account, it's possible they have a claim. But the roommates might argue that since the first TV was shared, the second one should be too. The author didn't consider sharing the profit, which could be seen as selfish. However, the original agreement didn't cover a second TV. The other roommate didn't have an issue, which adds complexity. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the second TV was an error and not part of the original agreement. They ordered it under their own account and had the right to claim it. However, since the first TV's cost was split, there might be an expectation that the second TV's profit is shared. But the key is that the second TV was a mistake. The author's responsibility is to their own account, so they might be justified in keeping the profit. The roommate's entitlement might not be valid since it wasn't agreed upon. So the answer is B (No).\n"
