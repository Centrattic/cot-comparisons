  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two others. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The person bought the second one under their name, tried to sell it, and their roommate got mad when they found out the TV was sold without splitting the money.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the second TV belonged to the person or if the roommates had a claim. The original TV was purchased by the person but with shared funds, so maybe the roommates have a right to the original TV. But the second TV was a free one that came by mistake. The person assumed it was theirs because they ordered the original. But maybe the mistake was in delivering two, so the second one's ownership isn't clear.\n\nThe roommates split the cost of the original, so the person might have an obligation to share the profit from the second TV. Even if the person paid for the original, the mistake delivery might make the second TV a shared asset. The person didn't consult the roommates before selling it, which could be the issue. The roommate who tried to buy it from the person was denied, but after the sale, they were upset about not getting a share. The person argued that the TV was theirs because it was under their name, but maybe the shared purchase agreement for the original TV should have extended to any duplicates. The key is whether there was an agreement on handling duplicates. Since the person didn't consider the roommates' entitlement, they might have acted selfishly. So, the person could be in the wrong for not splitting the profit from the second TV.\n"
