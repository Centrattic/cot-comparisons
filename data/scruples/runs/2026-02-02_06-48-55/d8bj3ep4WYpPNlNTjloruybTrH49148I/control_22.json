We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime because of a discount. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The author took the second TV, sold it, and now one roommate is upset and wants a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The original TV was paid for by all three, so each contributed a third. The second TV was a mistake, but it's the same model. The author sold it without consulting the others, and one roommate is upset. The other roommate is fine.\n\nThe author's defense is that the TV was ordered under their name, and the other roommate was asking to buy it from them, which they turned down. The roommate then got angry when the TV was sold. The author didn't think the others were entitled to the second TV's money.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author had the right to claim and sell the second TV. Let's break it down. When the TV was ordered, even though it was under the author's account, since it was a shared purchase, maybe the ownership should be considered joint. The second TV was a mistake, but since the original cost was split, perhaps the second one should be considered joint property as well. The author might have the right to the first TV since they ordered it, but the second one's ownership is unclear. \n\nBut the problem is that the mistake in delivery might not make the second TV automatically belong to the author. Typically, if you receive a mistake delivery, the rightful owner is usually the one who paid for it. However, in this case, the original purchase was a shared expense. The author paid for it with their account, but the cost was split. So maybe the ownership of the first TV is joint, and the second TV, which was a free one, might be considered the property of the person who received the first one, which could be the author. But since the roommates contributed, perhaps the second TV's ownership is ambiguous.\n\nThe author sold the second TV, thinking it was theirs. The other roommate felt entitled to a share. The key issue is whether the second TV was a replacement or an error. If it was an error, the author might not have a right to it unless they can prove they paid for it. However, since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might belong to the group. \n\nAlso, the author didn't consult the roommates before selling the second TV. Even if the author believed they had the right, not discussing it with the others could be a problem. The roommate's entitlement might stem from the fact that they contributed to the original purchase, so they might feel the second TV is a joint asset. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author didn't discuss the second TV's handling with the roommates, it's possible they acted unilaterally, which could be seen as selfish. Even if legally the author might have a claim, ethically, sharing the profit from the second TV could be expected, especially since the mistake delivery might be an error that Amazon expects to be returned. If the author sold it without checking, they might have acted in their own interest without considering the roommates' contributions or expectations.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the second TV was considered a joint asset or the author's personal property. If the original purchase was joint, then the second one might be as well. The author's decision to sell it without consulting could be the issue. The roommate's anger is because they felt entitled, even if the author didn't think so. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their roommates' perspectives and not sharing the proceeds.\n"
