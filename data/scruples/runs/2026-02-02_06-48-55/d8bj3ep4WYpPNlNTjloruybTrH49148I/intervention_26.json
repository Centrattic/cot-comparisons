We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, split cost with two roommates. Then, a second TV was delivered by accident. The author sold both TVs without splitting the profits, and one roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was under the author's account but with a shared cost. So the initial TV is co-owned, right? But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The key here is whether the second TV was actually paid for. If the second TV was a mistake, it's possible that Amazon charged the author's account again, meaning the author's roommates also contributed to that second one. If that's the case, then the author might have an obligation to split the proceeds from selling both TVs.\n\nWait, the user says the second TV is a different brand but identical in features. The author bought the first one under their Prime. If the second was an error, maybe it was a duplicate order. But if the roommates split the cost of the first, did they also split the cost of the second? If the author didn't order the second one, but it was delivered by accident, then maybe the author didn't pay for it. But sometimes, when a duplicate is sent, the company might charge the same method again. So if the author's credit card was charged again, then the roommates might have a claim on that second TV since they also contributed to the original cost, which might have been covered by the same account.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the second TV was theirs because it was ordered under their name. But the original agreement was that any proceeds from selling the TVs would be split three ways. The author sold both, but only the first was intended. The second might not have been paid for by the roommates, so maybe they aren't entitled to it. However, if the author returned the second TV, they might have received a refund that was part of the original order. But the author sold it instead, which could be seen as using a mistake to gain an advantage.\n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it was trying to buy it from the author, so the author thought they had the right to sell it. But if the second TV wasn't actually paid for by the group, then the author might have a right to keep the money from selling it. However, if the mistake was on Amazon's side and the author kept both TVs, maybe they should have shared the second one as a windfall. The author's other roommate had no issues, which suggests maybe they didn't contribute to the second one's cost.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the second TV was a result of an error they didn't initiate and if the roommates' payments were part of that mistake. But if the second TV was a free mistake that the author didn't pay for, then maybe not. The problem is the initial agreement was that when selling, the proceeds would be split. If the second TV wasn't part of that original agreement because it wasn't ordered, maybe the author is not obligated. However, the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, considering the original purchase was a joint decision.\n\nWait, the original TV was a shared purchase. The second one was an accidental delivery. If the author kept the second TV, they should have considered that the roommates might not be responsible for that extra charge. But if the author didn't return it and instead sold it, they might have kept the money that was effectively a mistake. The roommates might argue that since the original cost was shared, any additional TVs from the same order should be shared too. But the author didn't order the second TV, so maybe they shouldn't have to split the proceeds. However, the initial agreement was about selling the original TV, not the accidental one. The author might have a point if the second TV was a mistake not involving the roommates' payment. But if the author received a refund for the second TV, they should have shared that with the roommates. The problem is the author didn't return it and instead sold it for profit.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether the roommates were responsible for the second TV's cost. If they were, then the author is in the wrong for not splitting the proceeds. If they weren't, then the author isn't in the wrong. The post says the author \"claimed\" the second TV as theirs because it was under their name, but the roommates might feel entitled because they shared the original cost. The author's action could be seen as not considering the shared ownership of the original purchase's mistake. The answer depends on whether the second TV was a paid mistake or a free one. The user's post says \"with a free $600 TV,\" implying the second one was free. So the author didn't pay for it, meaning the roommates didn't contribute to it. In that case, the author is not in the wrong because the second TV was an error they didn't cause and the roommates aren't entitled to a free TV. The author acted within their right to sell it and keep the money. The roommate's frustration might be because they assumed they were entitled to a share, but if it was a free error, they weren't responsible for the cost. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
