We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the account is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime because of a discount. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one is a different brand but identical in features. The author thought it was theirs and wanted to sell it. One roommate kept trying to buy it from them but got rejected. Eventually, the author sold it, and the angry roommate started demanding her share of the money, calling the author selfish.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault for claiming the second TV as theirs. They argue that the original TV was bought under their name, and the roommate approached them to buy the second one, implying ownership. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement between the roommates. They split the cost of the original TV, so maybe they had an agreement about ownership. But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The key point is whether the second TV is considered part of their original purchase. If the first TV was paid for by all three, but the second one was an error, does that mean the second one is the author's? Or does it belong to all three?\n\nThe author ordered the original TV under their Amazon account. If the second TV was also part of the same order, maybe it was a mistake in shipment. But since the author didn't pay for the second one, it's unclear if it's their property. However, since the original purchase was their responsibility and the second one was a mistake, maybe the author thought they could handle it. But the problem is that the roommates might have a claim because they contributed to the original purchase. The author didn't consult the roommates before selling the second TV, which could be an issue. The roommate who was angry felt entitled because she thought the second TV was part of their shared purchase. The author didn't consider that maybe the mistake was due to the shared order, and thus the second TV should be treated similarly to the first one, requiring splitting proceeds.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they ordered it under their name, it's theirs. However, the initial agreement was that when selling the TV (the original), they'd split the profits. If the second TV was a result of the same purchase, maybe the roommates have a right to a share. The author might have made an assumption that the second TV was entirely theirs without considering the shared context. Even though they paid for the original, the mistake might have been a result of the shared purchase, so the second TV could be considered communal property. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not splitting the proceeds from the second TV. Alternatively, since the second TV was an error and the author didn't request it, maybe it's their responsibility to handle it, but the roommates could have a right to a share since they co-funded the original. The answer depends on the original agreement and whether the second TV is considered part of the shared purchase. The author didn't communicate properly with the roommates about the second TV, leading to conflict. So, likely answer A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the roommates' shared contribution and the original agreement when handling the second TV.\n"
