We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was mistakenly delivered. The original TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. So they bought one TV, but Amazon sent two. The author sold the second one, and a roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement. They split the cost of the original TV, so maybe the second TV is considered a windfall. But since they all paid for the first one, maybe the second is a profit. The author sold it and kept the money, but the roommate is arguing they should split it. \n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was ordered under their name. But since the cost was split, maybe the ownership of the second TV isn't clear. If the second TV was a mistake, perhaps the ownership isn't clear. The roommate might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nThe other roommate didn't have an issue, so there's some ambiguity. The author didn't think the others were entitled, but maybe they should have considered that the second TV came from a shared purchase. Even though the order was in the author's name, the initial payment was shared. So the second TV might not be entirely the author's to claim. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the profit from the second TV (since the first was already paid for) could be considered a shared gain because of the collective purchase. The author might have been wrong to not share the profit. So the answer might be A, they're in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused because the original purchase was shared, but the order was under the author's account. Maybe the second TV was a mistake, so ownership isn't clear. If the company delivered by mistake, maybe the author shouldn't have sold it without consulting others. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
