We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake. The key points are:\n\n1. The original TV was purchased under the author's Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. The agreement was to sell it upon moving out and split the profits.\n2. A second, identical TV was delivered accidentally. The author took it, sold it, and didn't share the proceeds with one of the roommates.\n3. One roommate tried to buy it from the author but was refused. The author eventually sold it without the roommate's knowledge, leading to conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether the author had the right to keep the second TV. The purchase was under the author's account, but the cost was shared. The second TV was likely a mistake by Amazon. The roommates might argue that since they paid for the original TV, the second TV is also their property. However, the original purchase was under the author's name, so maybe they had a right to it. But since it was a mistake, perhaps the second TV belongs to the author individually. The conflict arises because one roommate felt entitled to a share, possibly because they contributed to the original cost. The author didn't consider sharing the proceeds from the second TV, which might be the issue. So, is the author in the wrong for not splitting the money? It depends on whether the second TV was a joint property or the author's alone. If the second TV was a result of the original order (even if a mistake), maybe the roommates have a claim. Alternatively, since it was a mistake, maybe the author can keep it. The answer isn't straightforward, but the author not considering the roommates' contributions might have been a mistake.\n"
