We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a TV that was bought by three roommates, split the cost. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The person took the second TV, sold it, and the roommate was upset about not getting a cut.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original purchase was for one TV, but two were delivered. The person thought they could claim the second one because it was ordered under their account. The roommates agreed to split the cost and profits. The person sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered under the person's account, but they split the cost with roommates. The second TV is a mistake by Amazon. The person assumed it was theirs to sell, but the roommates might feel entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nThe person's defense is that the TV was in their name, and the other roommate was trying to buy it from them. But the problem is that the mistake (getting two TVs) might be the seller's error, so the second TV's ownership isn't clear. If they paid for one TV, then the second one is a free item. However, since the original purchase was shared, maybe the second TV's ownership isn't entirely the person's to do with as they please.\n\nAlso, the roommates might argue that since they all paid for the original TV, any mistakes or errors related to that purchase should be split equally. So selling the second TV without sharing the profits could be seen as unfair, even if the person ordered it. The other roommate's anger comes from feeling that the profits should be shared.\n\nAnother angle: when they agreed to split the profits, maybe they meant for the original TV. The second TV wasn't part of the agreement. But the person might have thought since the mistake was on Amazon's end, they could handle it alone. However, since they all paid for the initial purchase, the mistake could be considered a shared benefit or problem.\n\nThe person might not be in the wrong if the second TV was a complete mistake and there's no obligation to share it. But since the roommates paid for the original purchase, maybe the mistake is a shared windfall. The key is whether the second TV is a result of a shared purchase or a personal purchase by the person.\n\nIf they ordered it under their Amazon account, maybe they have more claim to it. But the roommates contributed to the cost, so perhaps the ownership is shared. The person didn't consult them before selling, which could be the issue. Even if they had a right to the second TV, not informing the roommates led to conflict. So, maybe the person should have discussed it first.\n\nIn terms of legal vs. ethical. Legally, if the person's account ordered it, they might have the right. Ethically, since the roommates paid part of the original purchase, maybe they should have shared the windfall. The person's decision to keep the profit without consulting could be seen as ethically wrong, hence AITA.\n\nSo the answer depends on whether the second TV is considered a personal gain or a shared one. If the original purchase was shared, the mistake might be shared. Therefore, the person is in the wrong (A) for not considering their roommates.\n"
