We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and two roommates bought a TV together, split the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author took the second one, sold it, and now one roommate is upset because she wanted her cut.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the ownership of the TV and the second TV. The original TV was paid for by all three, but ordered under the author's account. But they agreed that when they move out, they'd sell it and split the profits. So the original TV is a shared purchase, but the second TV was a mistake from Amazon. The author took the second one as their own, thinking they could sell it because they ordered it. But the roommate is upset because she thought she had a claim.\n\nWait, but the second TV was delivered by accident. If the author ordered it, maybe they actually purchased two TVs by mistake? Or was it an error on Amazon's side? The author says they ordered one, got two. So the second one wasn't part of the original purchase. But the author then sold the second one, keeping the money. The roommate is arguing that since they all split the cost of the original TV, they should also get a share of the second one.\n\nBut the original purchase was under the author's Amazon account. So maybe the second TV was a duplicate sent by Amazon, and the author wasn't supposed to have it. If the author didn't pay for the second one, then technically it's their property to do with as they wish, right? But the roommates might argue that since they all contributed to the original purchase, any bonus items should be shared. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, so maybe the author is within their rights to keep it.\n\nBut the problem arises because the roommate thought she was entitled to a share. The author didn't consider splitting the profits from the second TV, which was their mistake. The main question is whether the author should have shared the second TV's proceeds. Since the second TV was a mistake, and the author ordered it under their own account, they might not be obligated to share. However, since they were roommates and the original purchase was shared, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with them.\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways, but the author paid for it under their Amazon. So maybe the roommates expected that any bonuses related to that purchase would also be shared. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It was an error. So the author received a free TV from Amazon, which they then sold. The roommates might not have any claim to that because it wasn't part of their original agreement. The agreement was about the original TV. The second TV is an unexpected gain, so the author might be right to keep it.\n\nBut the roommate is upset because she felt entitled. The author didn't consider her feelings, even though there was no prior agreement about the second TV. Since the author ordered it under their own account and the second TV was a mistake, the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe the author should have been more transparent and discussed it with roommates, even if they weren't entitled. But the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Since there's no explicit agreement about the second TV, the author isn't wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
