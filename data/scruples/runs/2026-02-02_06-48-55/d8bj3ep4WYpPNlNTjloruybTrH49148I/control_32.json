We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate, split the cost with two others. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author kept the second one and sold it, but one roommate was upset and wanted a cut of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon account, and they had an agreement to split costs and profits when they moved out. The second TV, a free one, wasn't part of the original purchase. The author believed it was theirs because their name was on the delivery. The roommate wanted to buy it from the author, but the author sold it to someone else, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author had the right to claim the second TV. The initial agreement was for the original TV. The second TV is an error, so there's no prior agreement on its ownership. The author split the cost for the original TV, which was a group purchase, but the second TV was an unexpected bonus. Since it was delivered under the author's name, they might have assumed it was their property, especially since they ordered the original. However, the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they feel ownership extends to the second TV.\n\nBut wait, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The error might be Amazon's mistake, so the house as a whole might have a claim. But the author's name was on it. The author didn't consult the roommates before selling it. The roommate who wanted to buy it was upset because they felt entitled to a share. The author didn't consider them entitled, but the roommate feels otherwise.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma is about ownership. If the second TV is considered part of the original purchase, then all three roommates would have a claim. However, since the author ordered it using their account, maybe they thought it was their own to handle. But the original agreement was to split costs and profits. The second TV's ownership wasn't discussed, so maybe the author should have included the roommates in the decision.\n\nThe key factors are: 1. Ownership of the second TV. 2. Whether the roommates had a right to a share of the proceeds. 3. Communication and agreement.\n\nIf the second TV was an error, the house as a group might have a claim, especially since the original purchase was a shared expense. The author might be in the wrong for not consulting and selling it without considering the roommates. However, the original purchase was the author's decision, and the second TV's delivery under their name could imply ownership. The roommate's entitlement depends on whether the second TV is considered part of the group's purchase.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because, even though the original TV was their purchase, the second one was an error, and it's unclear if it should be considered part of the original transaction. The group might have a claim to it since the original was a shared expense. Plus, the author didn't consult the roommates before selling, which could be seen as selfish. The roommate's anger is understandable if they felt excluded from the decision. So, answer A (Yes).\n"
