We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was mistakenly delivered as a second package. The author bought the TV under their Amazon account, split the cost with roommates, and sold the extra one. Now one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased by the author using their Amazon Prime, even though the cost was split. The second TV was an error. The author took it upon themselves to sell the extra TV, not considering the roommates. The key points here are the ownership of the original TV and the second one.\n\nSince the original TV was ordered under the author's account, maybe the second one was a mistake by Amazon. But the cost was split, so technically the purchase was a shared expense. Even though the author paid, the roommates contributed financially. So the second TV, being an error, might belong to the group. The author sold it without consulting everyone, leading to conflict.\n\nThe roommate argued for the cut of the money, which the author didn't provide. The author thought the second TV was theirs because it was their order. However, since the purchase was a shared decision and cost, the extra TV might be considered communal property. The author didn't involve the roommates in the decision to sell, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe other roommate had no issues, but one was upset. The author's actions might have overlooked the initial agreement, especially since the purchase was a group decision. The error delivery might mean the extra TV isn't the author's to claim solely. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not splitting the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates, even though they ordered it.\n"
