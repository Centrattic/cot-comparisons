We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author bought the TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates, and then when a second one arrived, they sold it without considering splitting the profits.\n\nSo, the main question is whether they should have shared the money from the second TV. The author's roommate felt entitled to a cut, leading to conflict. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was a group decision. The cost was split three ways, and the agreement was that when moving out, the TV would be sold and profits split. However, the second TV was an error by Amazon. The author took ownership of it, sold it, and didn't share the proceeds. The roommate argued they should get a portion.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the second TV was an accidental delivery. They might not have agreed to share the second one since it wasn't part of the original plan. The author probably thought it was their own because it was under their account. But since the initial purchase involved roommates, maybe they should have discussed the second TV with them instead of assuming ownership.\n\nOn the other hand, the second TV was an error, and the roommates weren't part of the purchase. The author didn't intentionally buy a second one. However, since the first TV was a shared expense, the unexpected second TV might be considered part of the same situation. The roommates might feel that since the first TV was a joint purchase, any surplus from the second should be shared. \n\nBut the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author wasn't obligated to share the second one unless they had an agreement. The problem is that the author didn't communicate about the second TV, leading to the roommate feeling wronged. The key here is whether the roommates had any claim to the second TV. If the second TV was an error and not part of their original purchase, then the author might be right to claim it. However, if the delivery was a mistake, maybe the rightful owner is the one who should have received it, which in this case might still be the author since it was their order. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Even though the TV was ordered under their account, the initial purchase was a shared expense. The roommates contributed to the first TV, but the second one wasn't their expense. However, maybe the roommates contributed to the first TV, so the accidental second TV could be seen as a windfall from an error, and since the first TV was a joint purchase, the windfall might be considered a joint asset. \n\nAlternatively, since the second TV was an error and not part of the original purchase, it's the author's to deal with. The author didn't owe the roommates anything unless there was an agreement. The roommate's entitlement might be based on the initial purchase, but the second TV is separate. \n\nThe author did mention that the roommate was insistent on buying the TV from them, which implies the roommate thought it might belong to the author. The author sold it, and the other roommate had no issues. So, the conflict is mainly with one roommate. \n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the author is technically not in the wrong, not considering sharing the windfall could be seen as selfish. But legally, the author might have the right to the second TV since it was their order. However, ethically, maybe they should have shared it as a goodwill gesture, especially since the first TV was a shared expense. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the second TV is considered a personal gain or a shared gain. Since the second TV was an error and not part of the original agreement, the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
