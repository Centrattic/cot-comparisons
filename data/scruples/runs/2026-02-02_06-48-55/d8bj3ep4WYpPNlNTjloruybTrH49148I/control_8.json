We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, split costs with two others. Then, an extra TV arrived, and the person sold it without splitting the profit with one roommate who got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author, using their account, with the cost split three ways. They agreed that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, an extra TV came, identical but different brand. The author decided to sell it, and one roommate was upset about not getting a share.\n\nNow, the main issue is ownership of the second TV. Since the original was ordered by the author, but the cost was shared, the initial purchase was a group decision. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon, so it's unclear if the author is entitled to it. The problem is whether the second TV belongs to the author alone or to all three roommates.\n\nThe author assumed they could sell the second TV because it was under their name. However, since the first TV was a joint purchase, maybe the second one is also joint property? Or since it was an accident, maybe the author should have checked with everyone first. The author didn't consider that the second TV might be part of the shared purchase, so selling it without consultation could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the roommate who tried to buy it from the author thought it was the author's, which complicates things. The author might have led that roommate to believe they owned the TV, but when they sold it without sharing profits, the roommate was upset. The other roommate had no issues, so maybe the conflict is only with one person.\n\nLegally, if the TV was delivered to a shared address and the purchase was a joint expense, even if ordered under the author's account, the extra item might be considered communal property. Ethically, the author should have discussed the second TV's ownership with all roommates before selling it. The author's assumption that they could handle it alone could be the mistake. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't share the profit from the second TV, which should have been split since it was a joint purchase or at least discussed.\n"
