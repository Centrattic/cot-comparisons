We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime because there was a discount. They had an agreement that when they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits three ways or sell it to the roommate who wanted it. \n\nThen, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same features. The author thought it was their own and wanted to sell it. One roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, but they turned down the offers. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else. The other roommate got mad and demanded her share of the money, calling the author selfish. The other roommate didn't have a problem.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for claiming the second TV as theirs and not considering splitting the profit with the roommate who was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to check the initial agreement. They agreed to split the cost and when moving out, split the profits from selling the original TV. The second TV was an accident. The question is whether the second TV is part of that agreement.\n\nThe author ordered the TV under their Amazon account, so maybe they felt ownership over it. But the cost was split three ways, so the roommates contributed to the original purchase. However, the second TV was a mistake by Amazon, so it's unclear if it was paid for by the author's account or if the roommates were charged. If the original purchase was split three ways, maybe the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. \n\nThe author might have assumed that since they ordered it, it was their property. But since the cost was shared, maybe the roommates had a right to expect that any additional items from the same order would be shared. The problem is that the second TV was an error, so it's unclear if it was paid for by the author's account or if the others had any financial stake in it. \n\nThe author didn't mention discussing the second TV with the roommates. They just assumed they could sell it. The roommate who was trying to buy it felt entitled, but the author sold it to someone else. The other roommate had no issues, but maybe because they weren't involved in the negotiation. \n\nSo, if the second TV was an accident and not part of the original agreement, the author might have the right to it since they ordered it, but if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, there's an argument that the second TV's profit should be shared. However, since the second TV was a mistake, it's possible that the roommates didn't pay for it, so the author isn't obligated to share the profit. The key is whether the roommates had any financial stake in the second TV. If they didn't, then the author isn't wrong. But if the roommates expected any benefit from the original shared purchase, maybe the second TV should be considered communal property. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the original TV was bought under their name and they didn't think the others were entitled to the second one. The roommate's anger comes from expecting a share because they split the original cost, but the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author might not be wrong because the second TV was an error and not part of the shared purchase. However, maybe they should have discussed it with the roommates first instead of assuming ownership. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the second TV was an accident and not part of the original shared purchase. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so the author can claim it. But maybe the author should have communicated better with the roommates. However, based on the information given, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
