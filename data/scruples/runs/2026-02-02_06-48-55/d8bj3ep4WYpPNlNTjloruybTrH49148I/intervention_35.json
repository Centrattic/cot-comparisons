We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author bought the TV under their Amazon account, split the cost with two roommates, and then when a second TV came, they sold it without consulting the roommates. Now one roommate is upset and wants a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. So even though the author paid for it, the roommates contributed financially. Then the second TV arrived. The author believed it was theirs, sold it, and kept the money. The problem arises because the roommate thought she was entitled to a share of the profit from the second TV.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the second TV is considered the author's personal property or a shared purchase. Since the first TV was a shared purchase, maybe the second one, being an error, was also part of that shared ownership. But the author ordered it under their account. However, the roommates paid their share for the first TV, so maybe they had an expectation that the second TV would be handled in a similar shared manner.\n\nThe author thought it was a nice thing to do to sell it themselves, but the roommates might have thought that since the first TV was a shared purchase, any extra items received due to the order (like the second TV) would also be shared. The author didn't consult them, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't inform their roommates about the second TV, which could be seen as not being transparent. Even though they ordered it under their account, since the purchase was a joint effort with shared costs, the second TV might be considered a joint asset as well. The author's decision to sell it without discussion could be seen as taking ownership without considering the roommates' contributions to the original purchase. On the other hand, the author might argue that they paid for the second TV themselves through Amazon, but since the original purchase was shared, the error might have been on Amazon's part, leading to an accidental receipt that the roommates might have a claim to.\n\nI think the key here is the expectation set by the roommates. The author and roommates agreed to split the cost and profits when selling the original TV. The second TV, being an error, might not have been intended to be part of the shared purchase, but since the original was shared, the roommates might have expected the same treatment. The author didn't consider that the second TV could be considered a windfall that should be split among all three roommates. By selling it without consulting, the author acted unilaterally, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include the roommates in the decision-making process regarding the second TV, even though it was in their name. The roommates contributed to the original purchase, so they might have a claim to the accidental delivery as well.\n"
