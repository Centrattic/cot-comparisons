We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was supposedly ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, but a second TV arrived. The roommate sold the extra TV and now another roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The original TV was ordered by one person, but the cost was split three ways. The key point here is whether the ownership of the second TV was clear. The original purchase was under the author's Amazon, but the cost was shared. So, was the second TV part of the original order? If it was a mistake by Amazon, then the ownership might be a bit murky. \n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs to handle because it had their name on it. However, since the original purchase was a shared expense, maybe the second one should have been considered communal property too. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which could be a problem. \n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy the TV approached the author directly, suggesting they thought it was the author's. But if the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might belong to all three. The author sold it without discussing, leading to conflict. \n\nLegally, if the TV was a mistake, the ownership isn't clear. Ethically, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, they might have a claim. The author didn't consider the roommates' contributions when selling the extra TV. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve everyone in the decision, even though the initial purchase was under their name. The shared cost implies shared ownership, especially of any unexpected gains. The answer could be A (in the wrong) because the author didn't account for the roommates' contributions in the second TV.\n"
