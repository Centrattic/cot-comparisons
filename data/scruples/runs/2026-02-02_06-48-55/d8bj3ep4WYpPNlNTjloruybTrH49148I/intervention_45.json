We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The original TV was purchased by the author under their Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two roommates. Then a second TV showed up. The author sold the second TV, and one roommate got upset over not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The author bought the TV but split the cost with roommates, and there was a plan to split profits if they sold it later. So the original TV was a shared purchase. But the second TV came as an error. Now, when the second TV arrived, the author thought it was theirs and sold it. The roommate wanted to buy it from the author but was turned down, and then when the author sold it to someone else, the roommate got angry about not getting a portion.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the second TV. Since the second TV was a mistake, it might not have been intended for the author. Even though the original purchase was under the author's account, the fact that the cost was split might imply that the roommates had some shared interest in the purchase. However, the second TV wasn't necessarily part of the original agreement. The author might have thought they could keep the free TV because it was a mistake on Amazon's part and they were the one who ordered it. But the roommate felt entitled because the cost was split.\n\nBut legally, if the second TV was a mistake, the author might be responsible for returning it or sharing it since the purchase was a shared expense. However, the author didn't return it. Instead, they sold it. The other roommate didn't have a problem, but one did. The author's reasoning was that the original TV was their purchase, so the second one was theirs. But since the cost was split, maybe the second TV's value should be split as well. The author didn't consider that, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the agreement. The original purchase was split, but the second TV was an error. If the author kept the second TV, maybe they should have shared the proceeds since the initial purchase was a joint effort. However, the author might argue that the second TV was an unexpected bonus and not part of the original agreement. But since the cost was shared, maybe the profits from the second TV should be shared too. The author didn't consider that, leading to the roommate feeling entitled. So the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds from the second TV, even if it was a mistake. Therefore, answer A.\n"
