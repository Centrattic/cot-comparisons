We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one is a different brand but same specs. The author decided to sell the second TV, and one roommate kept trying to buy it but got turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate got upset, demanding a share of the money. The other roommate was okay with it.\n\nThe key points here are: the original TV was bought collectively with shared funds, but ordered under the author's account. The second TV arrived as an error. The author took possession of it and sold it without consulting the roommates. The question is whether the author was wrong in claiming the second TV as their own.\n\nFirst, the original agreement was that when they move out, they would split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV was an unexpected bonus. Since it was a mistake by Amazon, the ownership isn't clear. The author argues that because the original purchase was under their name, the second one must belong to them. But maybe the mistake was that Amazon charged the same address, so maybe the second TV was meant for someone else with the same name? Or maybe it was a duplicate order. The author just took it as theirs.\n\nThe problem is that the roommates contributed to the original purchase. Even though the order was under the author's account, the cost was split. So maybe the second TV, being a mistake, should be considered part of the original purchase? If the mistake was that they were supposed to get two TVs for the price of one, then the roommates might have a claim because they all paid for the original TV. Alternatively, if the mistake was on Amazon's part, maybe the second TV isn't actually theirs to keep. But the author sold it, so maybe they should have checked first.\n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates when they sold the second TV. Even if the original TV was under their name, the second one's ownership isn't clear. Since the roommates had a shared interest in the original purchase, they might also have a claim to the second one. The author didn't consult them, leading to conflict. The roommate who was upset felt entitled because they had contributed to the original purchase. The author's actions of selling it without discussion could be seen as selfish, even if they didn't think the roommates were entitled. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's another angle. If the second TV was a separate order that was delivered by mistake, maybe the author had the right to keep it. But since the purchase was made with shared funds, even if under one person's account, the mistake might affect shared property. It's a bit ambiguous. The author didn't take responsibility for informing the roommates, which caused the issue. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
