We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author and two roommates split the cost of the original TV, which the author ordered under their Amazon Prime. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon sent a second TV for free. The author decided to sell that second TV, and one roommate got upset, thinking they were entitled to a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the second TV. The original TV was bought by the author using their account, but the cost was split three ways. So maybe there's an assumption that the TV is a shared purchase. But the second TV was an error from Amazon. When they received two TVs, the author probably thought it was their own mistake, but actually, maybe it was Amazon's. The question is, who owns the second TV?\n\nThe author mentions that the second TV had their name on the package, so that might imply it was addressed to them. If the original order was under the author's account, maybe the duplicate was also sent to the same address. So the author might have a claim to it. However, since the cost was split, maybe the initial purchase was a joint purchase even though the author placed the order. \n\nThe roommates split the cost, so they might have expectations that any additional items received would also be shared. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which could be a problem. The roommate who tried to buy it thought it was the author's, but maybe the other roommate felt it belonged to all of them. The author sold it without consulting the others, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the second TV a result of the original shared purchase? If the original purchase was split, then the second TV might be considered part of that same transaction, even though it was an error. The author might not have considered that the roommates had an equal claim to the second TV. By selling it without discussion, the author didn't respect the shared ownership implied by splitting the costs. \n\nAlternatively, if the second TV was a separate order or a mistake by Amazon addressed to the author, the author might have the right to it. But since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might also be considered a shared asset. The author's assumption that it was theirs alone could be the issue. The roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim to the second TV as well. \n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the author ordered it, the shared cost could imply shared ownership. The author selling it without consulting the others might be seen as taking something that belonged to the group. The roommate's anger could stem from feeling that their contribution to the original purchase gave them a right to a share in the second TV. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the shared nature of the original purchase when claiming the second TV. Even though the order was under their name, the shared cost could mean the second TV's value is also shared. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
