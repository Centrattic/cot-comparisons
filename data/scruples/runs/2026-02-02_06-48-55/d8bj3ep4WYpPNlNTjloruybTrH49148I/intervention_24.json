We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by claiming an extra TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it. The original TV was bought with the intention of splitting costs and profits later. The key points here are the ownership of the second TV and whether the roommates had a claim to it.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased under the author's Amazon Prime, which might imply that the purchase was made in their name. However, since the cost was split three ways, there's a shared ownership aspect. The second TV arrived as a mistake. Now, the question is who owns that second TV. If the delivery was a mistake, maybe the responsibility lies with the person who placed the order, which is the author. But the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they have a claim to both TVs?\n\nThe author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. The roommate argued they were entitled to a portion of the proceeds. If the second TV was part of the original purchase or a mistake in delivery, perhaps the ownership isn't solely the author's. Even though the author ordered it, since the cost was split, the roommates might have a shared interest in the second TV as well. The author didn't consider this and sold it, keeping all the money. That could be seen as unfair, especially since the roommates were contributing to the purchase.\n\nAlso, the roommate's anger comes from feeling entitled to their share. If the original agreement was to split profits from selling the TV, the second TV might be considered part of that original purchase. The author might have assumed the second TV was their own because it was delivered under their name, but since the purchase was a joint effort, the second TV might also be considered shared property.\n\nSo, the author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, sold it without their input, and kept the proceeds. This could be seen as a breach of trust and not honoring the shared agreement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A). But if the second TV was a separate delivery mistake unrelated to the shared purchase, maybe the author is right (B). However, since the purchase was split, the second TV's ownership is unclear. The author should have discussed it with everyone before selling. So, answer A.\n"
