We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice when they ordered one. The person bought the TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates, and then when the second TV came, they sold it, keeping the money. The roommate who tried to buy it from them is upset and wants a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the initial agreement. They mentioned that when they ordered the TV, they all agreed to split costs and when moving out, sell the TV and split the profits. The key here is the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon account, but the cost was split among three. So the ownership of the original TV isn't entirely clear. Did they agree that the TV would be jointly owned, even though it was ordered under one person's account?\n\nThen there's the second TV. Since it was an accident by Amazon, it's unclear if it's a mistake where they sent two identical items. The author assumed it was their own and sold it. The problem arises when the other roommate feels entitled to a share of the money from the second TV. \n\nI need to consider if the second TV is part of the original agreement. If the cost was split for the original purchase, maybe the second TV was also a result of the original order, so maybe it's part of the shared purchase. If Amazon sent two TVs because of an error, the ownership might still belong to all three roommates since the initial purchase was a joint effort. Therefore, selling the second TV without consulting everyone could be an issue.\n\nThe author thought they were acting in the roommates' best interest by selling it, but the roommate felt entitled. The main question is whether the second TV is considered part of the original purchase. If the original purchase was a shared expense, then the second TV might be considered a windfall that belongs to all, so selling it without splitting the proceeds would be wrong. Alternatively, if the author paid for the original TV under their Prime account, maybe they had a claim to the second one as a bonus, especially if the others didn't contribute to the second item.\n\nBut the cost was split three ways for the original TV. So maybe the initial purchase was a joint agreement, making the TV a shared property. The second TV might be considered an error, but if the payment was made via the author's account, maybe the seller's mistake was to send another item to the same address. However, since the cost was shared, the ownership might still be shared. The author's decision to sell the second TV without consulting the roommates could be problematic because it's possible the second TV was also part of the joint purchase, even if it wasn't intended.\n\nThe fact that one roommate tried to buy the TV from the author might indicate that there was some confusion about ownership. If the author had clarified that the second TV was an accident and discussed it with both roommates, then sold it with their consent, it would be better. But since they didn't, and the other roommate is upset, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the shared ownership of the second TV.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might also be considered shared property, even if it was a mistake. Therefore, the author should have split the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates. Hence, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
