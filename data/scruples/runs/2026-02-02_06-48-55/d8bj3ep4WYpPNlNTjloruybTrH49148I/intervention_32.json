We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV bought by roommates, split costs, and then an extra TV delivered. The author took the second TV, sold it, and a roommate got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime but split costs three ways. The second TV was a mistake. The author thought they could take it and sell it, giving the profits to themselves. The roommate felt entitled to a share.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author had the right to claim the second TV. Since the original purchase was a group decision, maybe the second TV, even though it was a mistake, should be considered part of the group's shared property. The mistake was Amazon's, so the TV might belong to the address where it was delivered, which is a shared house. Therefore, the roommates might all have a claim to it. The author might have assumed it was their own because it was their name, but since the address is shared, maybe the second TV should have been considered joint property.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consult the roommates before selling it. Even if they thought it was theirs, they should have discussed with the others. The roommate who was trying to buy it from the author might have thought it was a shared asset, hence the anger at not getting a portion.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was assuming ownership without clarifying with everyone. They might have breached the trust by not discussing the unexpected item. Even though the original purchase was their name, the context of shared living and joint expenses complicates ownership of the mistake item. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the roommates' potential claims to the second TV.\n"
