We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The author took the second one, sold it, and one roommate got upset, demanding a share of the money.\n\nNow, the key points. The original TV was paid for jointly, so the second one is a free one from Amazon's error. The author sold the second TV, which they didn't pay for, but the roommate argues they should get a cut. The author didn't see it that way because the original purchase was under their name, and the second TV was an accident.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether the free TV's value should be shared. Since the original purchase was a joint expense, maybe the second TV, being a result of that purchase (albeit a mistake), should be considered a joint asset. But Amazon's error might complicate that. If the author received the second TV because their account was used, but the cost was already split, does that mean the roommate's contribution to the original purchase entitles them to part of the free TV? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mistake was Amazon's, so the author wasn't entitled to the second TV. If they kept it and sold it, maybe they should share the proceeds since the original purchase was a shared expense. The roommates might feel entitled because part of their money went into the original order. However, the author might argue that since they ordered it and the mistake was on Amazon's side, they were the rightful recipient of the error, hence the second TV is theirs.\n\nBut legally, if the purchase was made with shared funds, the ownership might still be joint. Even though the order was under the author's account, the payment was split. So the second TV, being a result of that joint purchase, might belong to all three. Therefore, selling it without sharing the proceeds could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the roommate's anger comes from feeling entitled to a share because they contributed to the original cost. Even though it was a mistake, the initial purchase was a shared expense. The author's action of taking the second TV might have been a mistake, and not sharing the proceeds could be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because the second TV's value should be shared among all three roommates since the original purchase was a joint expense. The author didn't consider that the error was tied to a shared purchase, leading to the conflict.\n"
