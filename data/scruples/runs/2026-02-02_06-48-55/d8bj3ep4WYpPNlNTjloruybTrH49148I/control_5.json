We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their shared house. The key points here are the split cost of the original TV, the accidental delivery of a second one, and the subsequent sale of that second TV without considering the roommates.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased using the person's Amazon Prime with a discount. They split the cost three ways. The second TV was an error, so it's not part of their original purchase. The author sold the second TV, which had their name on it, and didn't share the profits. The roommate who tried to buy it was upset and demanded a cut, while the other roommate didn't mind.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues that the second TV was theirs to handle because it was delivered under their name and the roommate approached them directly to buy it. However, the roommate felt entitled to a share of the money from the sale. \n\nI need to consider if there was an agreement about the second TV. The original agreement was about splitting profits from selling the original TV. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. But since the cost was split for the original purchase, did the roommates have any claim over the accidental delivery? The second TV wasn't paid for by anyone, so maybe it's the author's to handle. However, since they were roommates and shared the living space, maybe there's an expectation of shared responsibility or profit? But the author didn't charge them for the second TV, so selling it and keeping the money might be their right. The roommate's frustration comes from not being involved in the decision, but if there was no prior agreement about the second TV, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
