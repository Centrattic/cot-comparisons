We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a second TV that was accidentally delivered, and the author sold it without splitting the proceeds with the roommates.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased using Amazon Prime under the author's account, but the cost was split three ways. The agreement was that if they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon sent a second TV. The author assumed it was theirs, sold it, and the roommate who was trying to buy it got upset because she felt entitled to a share.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the ownership of the second TV. Since the original purchase was split three ways, maybe the second TV, which was an error, should have been considered joint property as well. The author ordered it under their own account, but the initial purchase was a shared expense. So the second TV's ownership isn't clear. The author thought it was theirs, but if the delivery was an accident, maybe the ownership isn't automatically individual. Also, the roommate's insistence on buying it might have led the author to believe it was their own to sell. However, since the original purchase was a shared agreement, the second TV might belong to all three. The author didn't consult the others before selling, which could be the issue. So even though the author didn't split the cost of the second TV, the fact that the first TV was shared might imply that the second one was part of the same purchase. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds, since the second TV's ownership wasn't clearly individual. So answer A.\n"
