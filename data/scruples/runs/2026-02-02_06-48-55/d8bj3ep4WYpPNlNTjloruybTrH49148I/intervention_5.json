We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it without splitting the profits with their roommate. The key points here are the initial agreement, the delivery of the second TV, and the subsequent actions of the author versus the roommates' expectations.\n\nFirst, the author and roommates split the cost of the original TV, and agreed that when they move out, they'd sell it and split the profits. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, which might be a point of contention. When the second TV arrived, the author assumed it was theirs and decided to sell it, not considering the roommates might have a claim. \n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it from the author thought it was the author's, but the author didn't consider that the second TV might belong to them all. The author sold it and then the angry roommate demanded a share. The other roommate didn't mind. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The initial agreement was about the first TV. The second TV was an error, so its ownership wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might have thought it was their own because it was ordered under their account, but the roommates might argue that since they all contributed to the original purchase, the second one should be shared. \n\nHowever, the original purchase was split, but the second TV was an accidental delivery. The author didn't buy the second one intentionally. The problem arises because the author didn't consider the roommates' possible claims. Even if the author thought it was theirs, the roommates might feel entitled since the original purchase was shared. The author didn't communicate about the second TV, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the interpretation of ownership. If the second TV was a mistake, perhaps it's the author's to handle since it was ordered under their account, but the roommates might feel that because they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim. The author's responsibility might be to inform the roommates and discuss the second TV's fate, rather than assuming ownership. \n\nIn the end, the author didn't consider the roommates' expectations, leading to the conflict. Even if the author thought it was their right, not considering the roommates' possible feelings is where they went wrong. The correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate or consider their roommates' potential claims on the second TV.\n"
