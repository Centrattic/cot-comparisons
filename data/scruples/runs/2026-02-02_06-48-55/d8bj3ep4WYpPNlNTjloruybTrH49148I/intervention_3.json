We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for claiming a mistakenly delivered TV and selling it. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with two roommates and they all agreed to split the cost of a TV. The author ordered it via Amazon Prime, and there was a delivery of two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same specs. The author tried to sell it, and despite a roommate's offers, eventually sold it. Then the roommate got upset and demanded her share of the money, while the other roommate was fine.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was wrong to keep the second TV and sell it without giving the roommate a share. The author thought they were entitled to it because they ordered it under their name, but the roommate felt entitled to a portion because they split the cost of the original TV.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the initial agreement. They split the cost for the first TV, and agreed that when they move out, they'd sell and split profits. The second TV was a mistake, so it wasn't part of the original agreement. But did the original purchase under the author's name mean they owned the second TV?\n\nWait, the mistake was that Amazon delivered two TVs. If the author ordered the first one, maybe the second was a duplicate order. But the second one was a different brand but same features. Maybe the author thought it was a mistake and had the right to claim it since it was delivered under their name.\n\nHowever, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, does that imply they have any claim on the second TV? The author argues that the second TV was theirs to do with as they wanted. But the other roommate thought she was entitled to a share because of the initial cost split.\n\nBut the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The original TV's cost was split, but the second TV was an error. So the author might have a claim to it. However, maybe the roommates contributed to the initial order, so the mistake benefits the group? But the author didn't consult them before selling.\n\nAlso, the roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, which implies she might have been trying to get a deal, but when the author sold it to someone else, she got upset. Maybe she felt she should have had first dibs or a share.\n\nBut the author didn't share the proceeds. If the second TV was a free item due to a mistake, perhaps it's the author's to handle, unless there's an agreement. But since the initial purchase was a joint effort, maybe there's an expectation that the mistake affects all of them.\n\nThe key points: The author ordered the TV under their name, the second TV was a mistake. The roommates paid for the original TV. The author sold the second TV, leading to conflict. The other roommate had no issues, but one was upset about not getting her share.\n\nIn terms of ownership, if the second TV was a mistake, the author might have a claim to it since it was delivered under their order. But if the initial purchase was a shared expense, maybe the mistake should have been discussed. However, the author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates until after selling it. That could be the issue. The author didn't involve them in the decision, leading to conflict.\n\nBut the original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of that. The roommate's insistence on a share because of the initial split might be unfounded. However, the author's failure to communicate the existence of the second TV and the sale could have been handled better.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? If they considered the second TV as their own because it was ordered under their account and sold it without consulting, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there's an expectation that shared purchases mean shared ownership of any errors, then maybe they are. The roommate's claim might be based on a misunderstanding. The author's action of not sharing the proceeds could be seen as selfish, but if the TV wasn't part of the original agreement, it's a gray area.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I'm thinking maybe not. It depends on whether the mistake was the author's to handle. If the TV was delivered under their order, they might have the right to it. However, the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe the mistake should be shared? But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author's action might be justified, but the lack of communication is a problem. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for claiming it. If the TV was a mistake and delivered to the author's account, they might have a right to it. The answer could swing either way. But given the initial setup, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
