We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and they all split the cost of buying a TV. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime, and they had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits three ways. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The author took the second one, tried to sell it, and the other roommate was upset because she felt entitled to a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of both TVs. The original TV was bought by all three roommates, sharing the cost. So that one is jointly owned. The second TV was a mistake from Amazon, but it was delivered to the house and had the author's name on the package. The author claimed it as their own and sold it. \n\nThe key points here are: who owns the second TV? Since it was an accidental delivery, does the author have the right to claim it? The original purchase was split three ways, so maybe the second TV, being a duplicate, also belongs to all three? Or since the author's name was on the order, does that make it their personal property, even though they paid with shared funds?\n\nThe author thought that because the original TV was ordered under their Amazon, the second one was theirs. But the cost was split three ways, so maybe the order was made on behalf of all three? That complicates things. If the purchase was a shared expense, then perhaps the order was a joint purchase, even if the author's account was used. So the extra TV might also be considered joint property.\n\nAdditionally, the author sold the TV without consulting the roommates. Even if they thought they could do it, the roommates might have a claim, especially since the original TV was a shared purchase. The other roommate was trying to buy it from the author, but the author didn't consider splitting the proceeds from the second TV. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nSo, if the second TV was an error, maybe the correct approach would be to return it or check with the roommates. The author's assumption that it was theirs alone might be the mistake. Since the original purchase was a joint effort, the duplicate might also be joint property. Therefore, selling it without sharing the proceeds could be considered wrong. \n\nThe author might not have realized that the error in delivery doesn't automatically make the second TV their personal property. The fact that it was delivered to the shared house and the original order was a shared expense suggests that the second TV is also a shared asset. So taking it and selling it without splitting the money could be seen as taking advantage of a mistake and not considering the roommates' contributions.\n"
