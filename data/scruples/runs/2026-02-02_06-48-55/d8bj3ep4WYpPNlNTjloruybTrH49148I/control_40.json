We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong. So the situation is that they bought a TV with roommates, split the cost, and then a second TV was delivered. They sold the second one, and a roommate got mad because she thought she was entitled to a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. The agreement was that if they sold the TV later, profits would be split. Then, they got a second TV for free. The author thought it was theirs because it was under their account and sold it. The other roommate wanted to buy it but the author didn't take the offers. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate got angry about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the second TV the author's to dispose of? The original purchase was under their account, but they split the cost with roommates. However, the second TV was an error from Amazon. The author might have assumed it was theirs because it was part of their order, but technically, maybe it wasn't. The roommates might have a claim because they contributed to the original purchase, even if it was under the author's name. The agreement mentioned splitting profits from the original TV, so maybe the second TV, being an error, could be considered a windfall that should be shared.\n\nBut the author didn't think they were entitled to the money. The roommate argued that she was morally obligated to get a portion. The other roommate didn't have an issue. The problem is whether the author had the right to keep the proceeds from the second TV. If the second TV was due to a mistake by the seller, perhaps it's considered property that belongs to the person who received it by accident, which would be the house. Since the housemates all contributed to the original purchase, maybe the second TV is a shared windfall. Therefore, the author might have been in the wrong by not sharing the profit from the second TV, even though they paid for the original order. The roommates might feel they have a claim because they paid for the original TV, leading to the error. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
