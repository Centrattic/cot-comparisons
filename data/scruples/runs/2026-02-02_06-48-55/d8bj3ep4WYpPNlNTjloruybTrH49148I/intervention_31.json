We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a mistakenly delivered TV and selling it, keeping the money. The scenario is that the TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with roommates, and then a second TV showed up. The author sold it, and one roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the TV. The original purchase was made under the author's account, but the cost was split three ways. So, the initial TV was a shared purchase. When the second one arrived, it was a mistake. Now, the author took that second TV, sold it, and didn't share the proceeds. The roommate wants a cut, arguing they were entitled to a portion.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Mistakenly Delivered TV**: Since the second TV was an error, it's not clear who owns it. The author received it because it was delivered to their home, and it was under their name. But since the cost was split, does that mean the entire purchase is communal?\n\n2. **Agreement Among Roommates**: The roommates agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. But this was for the original TV. The second TV came as a bonus. The author decided to sell it, not consulting the others. That might be where the problem lies.\n\n3. **Responsibility to Inform and Share**: Even if the author thought they owned the second TV, they didn't inform the roommates about the mistake. The roommate who tried to buy it from the author might have felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. The author didn't consider sharing the proceeds from the second TV, which the roommate now claims they should be part of.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: While legally, the author might have a claim, ethically, there's a question about shared contributions and fairness. The roommate contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they expect some benefit from the error. The author's decision to sell it without discussing could be seen as not considering the roommates' contributions.\n\nSo, even though the original TV was split costs, the second TV's ownership is unclear. The author might not have thought about the roommates' contributions when handling the second TV. The roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a share, possibly because they were part of the original purchase. The author's lack of communication and sharing could be where they're in the wrong. Ethically, they might have an obligation to share the proceeds from the second TV since it's part of the same purchase mistake. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
