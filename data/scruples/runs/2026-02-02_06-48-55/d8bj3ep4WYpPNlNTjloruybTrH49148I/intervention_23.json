We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who bought a TV and then got a second one by accident is in the wrong for keeping the second one and selling it. The main points here are about shared expenses and what the free TV belongs to.\n\nFirst, the TV was purchased under the author's Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two roommates. The original agreement was that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then a second TV arrived, which the author assumed was theirs. They tried to sell it, and one roommate was pushing to buy it but the author turned her down. Eventually, the author sold it, and the roommate got upset, demanding her cut of the money.\n\nHmm, the key here is the ownership of the second TV. Since the original purchase was made under the author's account, maybe the second TV is also theirs, especially if it was a mistake by the seller. But the roommates paid for part of the original TV, so does the free TV count as a shared purchase? Wait, the original purchase was split three ways, so maybe the author didn't actually pay the full price. If the second TV came up as part of the same order, but the author paid for it using their Prime, does that mean the roommates didn't contribute to the second one? The problem is, the author might have thought the second TV was a replacement or an error, but if the cost was split, maybe the second TV is also a shared asset? Or is it just a duplicate from a mistake, so the author can claim it as their own surplus?\n\nAlso, the author tried to sell it and the roommate was making offers, but the author didn't accept. Then they sold it to someone else. The roommate got angry and felt entitled to a share. The author believed they were not obligated to share the profit from the second TV. \n\nSo, if the second TV was an accidental duplication, it's not part of the original shared purchase. The author might have the right to keep it since it's considered an error in their favor. However, the author lived with the roommates and the second TV was delivered to the shared house. The author didn't clarify with the roommates first, assuming it was theirs. But since the original TV was a joint purchase with shared costs, maybe the second TV is also part of that, or maybe it's a separate item the author bought by accident. \n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways, but the author paid it using their own Prime. Did the roommates actually pay their share to the author, or was the author just splitting the cost with them? If the author paid the full amount upfront using their Prime, but the roommates reimbursed them, then the original TV was a shared purchase. The second TV, if it's a duplicate, would be the author's to handle because they paid for it through their account. But if the roommates had already contributed to the original TV, then the second one might be considered a bonus that's part of the shared ownership? Or is the second TV a separate item that the author can take as their own because it was delivered to their account and they didn't inform the others?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they bought the original TV under their Prime and the second one was identical but different brand, maybe it was a mistake. They didn't feel the roommates were entitled to the second one. The angry roommate thought she should get a cut. \n\nIn some cases, if an accidental delivery happens and the person's name is on it, they can keep it, but this depends on the situation. Since the original purchase was shared, but the second one came up after the fact, maybe the author should have discussed it with the roommates first. However, the author might have thought it was their own bonus because they used their own account. The other roommate didn't have an issue, so maybe the problem is only with one of them. \n\nBut the original agreement was to split the profits from the TV when sold. If the second TV is considered part of the original purchase (maybe a mistake in shipping two), then perhaps the roommates would have a claim. If it's a separate accidental delivery (like the seller mistakenly sent two TVs for the price of one), then the author might be within their rights to keep it. \n\nThe question is whether the second TV is part of the original shared purchase. If the order was placed by the author, and the cost was split, but the second TV was a mistake, the author might not have to share the proceeds. However, if the second TV was part of the same order (like a mistake in quantity), maybe the roommates contributed to both, so the author shouldn't have kept the second one. But the author didn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the author paid for the original TV with their Prime, so if the second one is a duplicate, it's their property. The roommates didn't pay for the second one, so the author is not obligated to share the money from its sale. \n\nSo the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong, because the second TV was an error and the author's name was on the order, making it their property. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so there's no shared ownership. The author handled it by selling it and the roommate's anger seems misplaced since she didn't have a claim. But maybe there's a misunderstanding in the original agreement. If the agreement was that any additional items from the purchase would be shared, then the author is in the wrong. But the original agreement was about when they move out, splitting the original TV. The second TV is a separate item. \n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer.\n"
