We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered under their Amazon Prime account, split the cost with roommates, and then a second TV was delivered. The writer sold the second TV and the roommate who tried to buy it from them is upset, claiming entitlement to a portion of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, the key points: The original purchase was made by the author using their Amazon Prime, even though the cost was split. The second TV was an error by Amazon, so it's essentially a free item. The author decided to sell it, not considering the roommates' claims. The main question is whether the author had the right to keep the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nI need to consider the agreements made. The original TV was split in cost and profits. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, so it's unclear if the roommates were expecting to share in that. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV, which might be a problem. However, since the purchase was under their name, maybe they had the right to it.\n\nBut the second TV was a mistake. When you get something for free due to an error, the ownership isn't clear. The roommates might argue that since the original purchase was shared, the error benefits should also be shared. The author didn't discuss the second TV with them, leading to the conflict. \n\nThe roommate who tried to buy the TV thought it was the author's, so the author might have implied ownership. However, since the cost was split, maybe the roommates had some expectation in that bonus. The author didn't consider sharing the profit, which could be seen as selfish, but the original agreement didn't specify the error case.\n\nSo, depending on the perspective: If the error's benefit is considered part of the original shared purchase, the author might be in the wrong. If it's seen as the author's individual gain because it was ordered under their account, they might not be. The fact that the author didn't communicate the second TV's existence until selling it is a red flag. It's about transparency and whether the roommates had a right to expect a share of any unexpected gains from the original purchase.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't discuss the second TV with their roommates, leading to an ethical obligation to share the profits, even if the original agreement wasn't explicit. So the answer might be A.\n"
