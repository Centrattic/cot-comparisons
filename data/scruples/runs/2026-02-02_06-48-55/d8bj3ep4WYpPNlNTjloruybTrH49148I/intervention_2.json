We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident. The situation involves roommates and a purchase split among them.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon account, and they split the cost. The second TV was an error. The author decided to sell the second one without consulting the roommates. The main issue is whether the author had the right to keep and sell the second TV.\n\nThe key points here are: the TV was purchased with shared funds, even though it was ordered under the author's account. The roommates contributed to the cost, so maybe they have a claim to the second TV. The author assumed they could sell it because it was under their name, but the roommates might feel entitled to a share since they paid part of the original cost.\n\nAlso, one roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, but the author didn't consider the other roommate's entitlement. The author didn't consult the roommates about what to do with the extra TV. Since the TV was a joint purchase, the extra one might be considered joint property as well. The author might have been wrong to assume ownership solely based on the account used. \n\nSo, even though the author ordered it, the shared payment could imply shared ownership of any errors. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the roommates' contributions and not involving them in the decision to sell.\n"
