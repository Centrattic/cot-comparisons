We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation was in the wrong when they claimed a free TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The key points here are about ownership and shared responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime account because it was discounted. The roommates agreed to split the cost. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon, so it wasn't part of their original purchase. Now, the question is whether the author had the right to claim the free TV as their own and sell it without consulting the roommates.\n\nThe author moved into the house with two roommates and they all agreed to share expenses and profits from selling the TV. The free TV was an unexpected item. Even though the author ordered the original TV, the second one might have been a result of a delivery error. The roommates might not have been aware of this mistake, so when the author decided to sell it, the other roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nThe author's main reasoning is that the TV was in their name and the other roommate approached them specifically to buy it. However, since the cost was split, the free TV could be considered a shared asset, even though it was part of a mistake. The problem arises from the fact that the author didn't consult the roommates before selling it. Ownership of the second TV isn't clear because it was an error, and since the roommates had already shared the cost, they might have a claim to any additional items related to that purchase.\n\nEven though the author might have thought they were doing a nice thing by selling it, the fact that the other roommate felt entitled to a portion suggests that there was an unspoken agreement about shared purchases. The author's decision to sell the free TV without considering the roommates' contributions could be seen as disregarding their shared responsibility and ownership in the original purchase, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the roommates' interests in the free TV, even if unintentionally. The ethical obligation here is to share the benefits of any accidental gains when a shared purchase is involved.\n"
