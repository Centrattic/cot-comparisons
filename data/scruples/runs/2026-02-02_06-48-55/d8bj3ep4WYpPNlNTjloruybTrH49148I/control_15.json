We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who bought the TV and claimed the second one is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: They moved in with two roommates, agreed to split the cost of a TV. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. They decided to sell the second one, and the roommate tried to buy it but was refused. The person sold it to someone else, and now the roommate is upset they didn't split the proceeds.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership of the second TV. The original TV was paid for by all three splitting costs. The second TV was an error by Amazon. The person who ordered it took possession of it and sold it. The key points here are: \n\n1. Was the second TV considered part of the original purchase? Since it was a free TV, maybe it's not part of the original agreement. The original agreement was to split the cost of one TV. The second TV came unexpectedly. \n\n2. How was the second TV's ownership determined? The person who ordered it under their name might have the right to it since it was their account. But since the initial purchase cost was split, maybe there's an expectation that any extras would be shared? But the second TV wasn't part of the original transaction. The original TV's cost was split because they were buying one. The second TV was a mistake. \n\n3. The roommate argued that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim to the second TV. But the person didn't split the cost of the second TV. So maybe the entitlement is only to the original TV. \n\n4. The agreement mentioned selling the original TV when moving out and splitting profits. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The person didn't mention the second TV in the agreement, so maybe the roommates didn't expect a share of the second one. \n\n5. The roommate tried to buy the second TV from the person, which implies they thought the person had the right to sell it. The person refused and then sold it, which the roommate later objected to. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because the second TV was an error, not part of the original split. The original agreement only covered the first TV. Since the second TV was delivered under the person's Amazon account, they had the right to it. The roommates might have felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, but the second TV wasn't their responsibility or cost. The person didn't owe them a share of the second TV's proceeds. The roommate's anger seems misplaced because they didn't contribute to the second TV's cost. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
