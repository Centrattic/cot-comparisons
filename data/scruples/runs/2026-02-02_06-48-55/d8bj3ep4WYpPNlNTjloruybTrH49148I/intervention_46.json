We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The key points here are the ownership of the original TV and the second one.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered by the author under their Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell it and split the profits. So the original TV is a shared purchase since the cost was split, even though it was ordered under one person's account.\n\nThen, the second TV arrived by mistake. The question is, who owns this second TV? Since the original purchase was shared, maybe the second TV was a result of a mistake, perhaps a duplicate order? But the user didn't mention that. The delivery of two TVs might have been an error on Amazon's part, maybe they sent two because of a system glitch. \n\nThe author took it upon themselves to sell the second TV, thinking it was theirs. But if the original purchase was a group decision, even though ordered by the author, maybe the second TV is also considered a shared asset? The roommates might argue that since they all contributed to the original purchase, any mistakes or additional items should be discussed collectively.\n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it from the author might have thought the second TV was also a shared purchase, hence expecting a share. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which could be seen as taking ownership without their input. Even though the second TV was in the author's name, if it's a mistake, the ownership could be disputed. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the second TV with their roommates first. The agreement was about the original TV, but the second one wasn't part of the initial plan. The roommates might feel entitled to a share because the error could be tied to the shared purchase. Therefore, the author should have shared the proceeds of the second TV's sale with the roommates. \n\nBut wait, the original TV was ordered with the cost split, but the second one was a mistake. If the second TV wasn't ordered by anyone, maybe the author had the right to claim it. However, since it was delivered to the house they all share, the ownership might be a bit murky. The author might have the right to keep it, but the roommates who contributed to the original purchase might still feel they have a claim because the error was related to their shared order. \n\nIn that case, the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates. Since they didn't, and sold it without consulting, they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their roommates' contributions and potential share in the second TV.\n"
