  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered a TV through their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The person took the second one, sold it, and now a roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was agreed upon as a shared expense for the living room, so maybe the second TV is also a shared asset. Even though the order was under the user's name, the initial purchase was a group decision. So when the extra TV came, it might be considered communal property, especially since the cost was split. The user didn't consult the roommates before taking the second TV, which could lead to conflict.\n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it and later got upset might feel entitled because they contributed to the original cost. The user assumed ownership, but if the second TV is a mistake, perhaps the responsibility is on the company, but since it's free, they have to decide collectively. The user sold it without discussing, which could be seen as taking unilateral action. So maybe the user is at fault for not involving others in the decision.\n"
