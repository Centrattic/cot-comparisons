We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates who bought a TV together, split the cost, and later received a second TV by mistake. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, claimed the second TV, sold it, and now a roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The TV was bought with a discount via Amazon Prime. The second TV was a duplicate. The author sold it, thinking it was theirs. The roommate is demanding a share. The other roommate isn't.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the initial agreement. They split the cost and agreed to sell and split profits. But the second TV was an accident. The author ordered it under their Prime, which might imply ownership. The roommates didn't split the cost of the second TV. Since it was a mistake, the author might have the right to it as the one who ordered it. However, since they used shared resources (splitting the original purchase), maybe there's an expectation of shared ownership? But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It's an error from Amazon. The author might have the right to keep it since they were the one who received it under their account. The roommate's anger might stem from not being part of the initial agreement for the second TV. \n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates for the second TV's profit, but the original agreement didn't mention duplicates. So the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer is B.\n"
