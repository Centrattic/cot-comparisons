We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a package that was delivered to their shared house and had their name on it. The situation involves roommates and a TV purchase.\n\nFirst, the author bought a TV using their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same features. The author decided to sell it, and one roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author sold it to someone else. The roommate got angry, demanding her share of the money. The author is asking if they were wrong to claim the second TV as theirs.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The original TV was purchased by the author under their account, but the cost was split. So the ownership of the first TV is shared? Or was the author paying their share, but the TV became a shared item? The second TV\u2014since it was delivered to the house and the author's name was on it, maybe the author was the one who ordered it? But why were they sent two? Maybe a mistake by Amazon.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and agreement. The author ordered the TV under their Amazon, so the second one might be their property by default. But since they were living with roommates and shared expenses, maybe there's an unspoken agreement about shared purchases. The author thought they could sell the second TV because it was \"theirs,\" but the roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways. So the initial TV was a joint purchase. The second TV, though\u2014since it was delivered to the house and the author's name was on the order, perhaps the second one is the author's alone. But maybe the error in delivery meant that the author received a duplicate, so they have a claim to it. However, the author's roommate might argue that since the original was a shared purchase, any duplicates or errors in delivery should be shared as well. But the author didn't split the cost for the second TV, so maybe they didn't contribute to it. The author ordered it under their own account, so the second TV's ownership isn't shared unless there's an agreement otherwise.\n\nThe roommates didn't have an agreement about the second TV. The author proposed selling it, thinking it was theirs. The roommate tried to buy it but was turned down. Then the author sold it, leading to the conflict. The roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a share of the proceeds. But since the second TV wasn't part of the original shared purchase, unless there's an agreement that all purchases in the house are shared, the author might be within their rights.\n\nHowever, the author might have considered that since they were splitting costs for the original TV, any additional items from the same order might be considered shared. But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author's name was on the order, so legally, it's their property. But morally, maybe they should have shared the second TV with roommates since it was delivered to the house and part of the same purchase context.\n\nAlternatively, since the author paid for the original TV with their own Amazon, but split the cost with roommates, the ownership might be shared. The second TV, being an error, might have been the author's to handle. The roommates might not have a claim to it unless there's a prior agreement. The author didn't owe them a share if they didn't contribute to the second TV's cost.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase. The author's reasoning is that since the original purchase was split, but the second TV was an error and under their name, they had the right to it. The roommate's argument is about entitlement to a share because of the original shared cost. But the second TV wasn't part of that original shared expense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
