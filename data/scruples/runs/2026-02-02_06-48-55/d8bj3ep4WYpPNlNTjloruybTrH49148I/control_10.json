We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them buying a TV with roommates, splitting the cost, and then getting a second one delivered. They sold it, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main question is about ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. The second TV was an accident, and they sold it without consulting everyone. The roommate who tried to buy it from the author is now upset about not getting a cut.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that since they ordered it under their name, it's theirs. The roommate argues they should have shared the profit. The other roommate didn't have a problem. The author didn't consider the roommates' entitlement, thinking they weren't entitled.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the package has the author's name, it's likely their property. But since the cost was split, there might be an expectation of shared ownership. The initial agreement was that when moving out, they'd sell and split profits. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It was an accident from Amazon. The author didn't plan to get a second TV, so maybe they didn't think to include the roommates in the ownership of the second one. However, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they felt entitled to some share of any unexpected gains from the same product?\n\nBut the second TV was a free one, not part of the original order. The author might not be obligated to share the profits from an error by the seller. However, if the purchase was a joint effort, maybe there's an implicit agreement that any additional benefits from that purchase should be shared. The author didn't check with the roommates about the second TV, which could be a mistake. They assumed ownership because it was under their name, but the roommates might have felt since they contributed to the original order, they should share in the accidental gain.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the roommates had a claim to the second TV. If the purchase was a joint decision and they split the cost, maybe the second TV was a result of that joint purchase. But since the author ordered it under their own Amazon account, perhaps it's their personal property. However, the initial setup was for a shared purchase. The confusion might be in the ownership structure. The author might be in the right because the second TV was an error and not part of the original deal. But maybe they should have discussed it with the roommates, even if they didn't think the roommates were entitled. Not communicating could lead to issues, but the expectation of entitlement might be where the roommate is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a claim to any surplus from that transaction. The second TV could be seen as a windfall from the shared purchase, so splitting the profits makes sense. But since the author ordered it under their own name, it's unclear. Legally, it's their property, but ethically, maybe they should share since it's related to a shared expense.\n\nIn the end, the author might be in the right because the second TV was their property (since it was sent to them), but the misunderstanding came from not discussing it with the roommates. However, the roommates' contribution to the original purchase might give them a claim. But since the second TV was a mistake, maybe the author isn't obligated. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't have any prior agreement about the second TV, but the answer could also be A if the shared purchase implies shared ownership of any unexpected benefits.\n"
