We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered to their house. The key points are that they split the cost of the first TV, ordered it under their Amazon Prime, and when a second one arrived, they sold it without considering the roommates. The roommate who wanted to buy it was upset and felt entitled to a share of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The original TV was a shared purchase, split three ways. The second TV was an accidental delivery. The author took it and sold it, not considering the others. The question is whether they're in the wrong by claiming the second TV as their own.\n\nSo, when the second TV arrived, did the original agreement apply to both TVs? The original plan was to split the cost of one TV and then split profits or decide who keeps it when moving out. The second TV wasn't part of that original agreement. But the roommates all contributed to the first TV, so maybe they expected the second one to be split similarly? However, the author didn't know about the second TV being delivered. They just took it because it was their name on the order, which might be a point. \n\nBut here's the thing: even though the author ordered it under their Amazon, the purchase was a shared expense. If the second TV was a result of an error, it's possible that Amazon intended to charge the same account, so the cost was already covered by the shared funds. Therefore, the second TV might belong to all three equally. The author kept it and sold it without consulting the others, which could be seen as taking personal advantage of the error without considering the others' contributions. \n\nThe other roommate didn't have a problem, but the one who was trying to buy it from the author felt entitled. The author's reasoning is that the original purchase was under their name, so they thought the second one was theirs. However, since the initial cost was split, maybe the ownership of the second TV should be considered a shared asset, especially if the error was Amazon's and the second TV was free. The author might have assumed the second TV was a replacement, but if it's a separate unit, then the cost was already covered by the shared money, making it a group asset. \n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds. The fact that the roommate approached the author exclusively could mean she assumed the author owned it, but since the original purchase was shared, the author should have considered the others' input. The author's action of selling it without discussing with the roommates might be the issue here. Even if the author didn't think the others were entitled, the shared cost could imply shared ownership of any additional items that came from the same order, depending on the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the second TV was considered part of the original purchase. If it was a mistake, maybe the author should have checked with the group before claiming it. But if the second TV was a separate, free item (like a duplicate sent by error), then the author might have a right to it if their account was charged. Hmm. It's a bit ambiguous, but the roommates might feel that since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV should be treated the same way. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong by not consulting them. \n\nBut the author's argument is that the second TV was under their name. If Amazon sent an extra one, and the author's account was charged, then maybe the author is the rightful owner. However, if the cost of the second TV wasn't charged to the account (since it was a mistake), then the author might have to return it. But they sold it, so maybe they kept the profit. If the original cost was split, but the second TV was free, the author might have to split the proceeds since the money was a result of a shared asset. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The main issue is the assumption of ownership. The author might have thought the second TV was their own, but since the initial purchase was shared, the roommates could argue that any additional items from that order should also be shared. The author's actions of selling it without discussion could be seen as selfish. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
