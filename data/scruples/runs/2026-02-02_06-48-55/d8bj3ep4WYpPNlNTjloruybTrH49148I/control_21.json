We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they bought a TV with roommates, split the cost, and then Amazon delivered a second TV by accident. The author took that second TV, sold it, and now one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The roommates agreed to split the cost of the original TV, and there was a plan to split profits from selling it later. But the second TV was a mistake. The author ordered the original TV under their Amazon Prime. The second TV was identical but a different brand. The author thought they had a right to the second one since it was their purchase, and they sold it without consulting the roommates. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. Did the accident of receiving a second TV create a shared ownership of that second item? \n2. Was the second TV part of the original agreement where they split costs and profits?\n3. Did the author have the right to sell the second TV without consulting the roommates?\n\nThe original TV was paid for by all three, so any profit from selling it would be split. But the second TV was an error from Amazon. Since the author ordered it under their own account, maybe they had a stronger claim to the second one. However, the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they felt entitled to some share of the second TV's value. But the problem is that the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The accident might not bind them to the same profit-sharing arrangement. \n\nThe author might argue that since the second TV was a mistake and not part of their agreed purchase, they can handle it as they see fit. However, the fact that the roommates were involved in the original purchase could complicate things. If the second TV was sent by Amazon to the house, maybe it's considered an error in delivery, and the ownership isn't clear. If the author didn't communicate this mistake to the roommates, they might have acted unilaterally. \n\nThe roommate who was upset felt entitled to a share, which the author didn't consider. The author's decision to sell the TV without discussing it with the roommates could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the original agreement was about splitting costs and profits. Even though the second TV wasn't part of the original plan, the roommates might feel that since they were part of the initial purchase, they should be considered in any unexpected gains. \n\nBut on the other hand, the second TV was a mistake. If the author didn't owe the roommates anything for the second TV because it wasn't part of the original agreement, then they might not be in the wrong. However, since they lived together and had a shared household, maybe there's an expectation of transparency and shared resources, especially if the TV ended up at the house shared by all. The author might have assumed they could handle it alone, but not involving the roommates could be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author might be in the wrong because even though the second TV was a mistake, the roommates might reasonably expect a discussion about how to handle unexpected items delivered to the shared house, especially since the original purchase was a joint effort. The author didn't communicate or involve their roommates, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
