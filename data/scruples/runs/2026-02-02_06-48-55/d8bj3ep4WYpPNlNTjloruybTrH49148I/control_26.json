We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for taking a second TV that was accidentally delivered, selling it, and not sharing the proceeds with their roommate.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person ordered a TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates. The TV was delivered, and then a second one showed up. The second TV was a different brand but same specs. The writer decided to sell it, as they thought it was theirs since the purchase was under their name. One roommate kept offering to buy it, but the writer sold it to someone else. The roommate then got angry and felt entitled to a share of the profits. The other roommate had no problem.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership of the second TV. The original TV was bought under the writer's account, but they split the cost with roommates. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. Now, the question is, who owns the second TV? \n\nWhen you buy something and have others contribute to the cost, even if you made the purchase, the item is generally considered joint property if the others contributed financially and used it. So the original TV was a shared purchase. However, the second TV was an error. The company might have intended to send one TV due to a mistake, but the writer kept it without returning. \n\nOwnership of the second TV depends on whether it was a mistake by the seller. If the seller accidentally sent two items, the customer is usually supposed to return the extra one. By not returning it, the writer might be keeping a mistaken delivery, which could be considered unethical or even illegal if the seller didn't intend to send it. However, if the seller sent it by error, the writer is in a gray area. \n\nNow, regarding the proceeds from selling the second TV. If the second TV was a mistake, the writer might not have a clear right to it. If the roommates contributed to the original purchase, perhaps they had a shared interest in the TV, but the second TV is a separate issue. The roommate who tried to buy it might have felt a claim because they contributed to the original purchase, but does that extend to the second one?\n\nThe writer thought they were the sole owner because they made the purchase. However, if the original TV was a shared expense, maybe they should have discussed ownership of the second one. The roommate who kept offering to buy it might have felt that since they split the cost, they had a claim. The writer didn't consider the roommate's feelings, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? If the second TV was a mistake, the writer should have returned it or at least discussed with the roommates. By selling it without consulting, they might have overstepped, especially if the mistake was on the seller's side. The fact that one roommate was upset suggests that the writer didn't handle the situation well. Even if the original TV was a shared purchase, the second TV's ownership isn't clear. The writer might have been selfish in not considering the roommate's perspective, hence AITA. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the second TV was a free item that the writer was entitled to keep (maybe Amazon made a mistake but the writer could keep it), then the writer might not be at fault. However, the fact that the original purchase was split means that the roommates might have a claim to any extra items. The writer's decision to sell it without consulting could be seen as wrong. The answer likely leans towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the roommates' contributions or the error in delivery.\n"
