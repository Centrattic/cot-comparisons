We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split among three roommates. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author kept one, sold the second one, and now a roommate is upset about not getting a cut of the money from the second TV.\n\nFirst, the original TV was split in cost three ways. The second TV was a free one. The key issue here is ownership of the second TV. Since the first TV was ordered by the author under their account, but the cost was shared, maybe there's an agreement about joint ownership. But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The delivery of two TVs might be a shipping error. The author decided to sell the second one, assuming it was theirs. But since the cost was shared, maybe the second TV should have been considered joint property as well, or at least the proceeds from the free TV should be split.\n\nThe roommates agreed to split the cost of the first TV. But there's no mention of an agreement about the second TV. The author thought they could sell it because they ordered it and it was under their name. However, the mistake was Amazon's, so maybe the second TV is considered a windfall. In some cases, if a company delivers an extra item by error, the person might have to return it or share the proceeds if it's a group purchase. Since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might be considered a shared asset, so selling it without consulting the others could be an issue.\n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it was persistent, but the author sold it to someone else. The other roommate didn't have an issue. The author didn't think the others were entitled to the money. But the problem is whether the second TV was a result of a shared expense. If the original purchase was split three ways, even the second TV might be considered part of that agreement. Alternatively, since the second TV was a mistake, maybe it belongs to the person who ordered it. However, since the cost was shared, the author might have an obligation to share the proceeds from the free TV.\n\nIn legal terms, if the second TV was a result of a mistake, the rightful owner would need to be determined. If the original purchase was joint, then the second TV might be considered a joint asset. But if the author paid for it through their account, even though the cost was split, the ownership might be different. However, the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so they might have a claim to the second TV. The author's decision to sell it without consulting the others could be seen as not considering their contributions. So, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds from the second TV, even though it was under their name. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
