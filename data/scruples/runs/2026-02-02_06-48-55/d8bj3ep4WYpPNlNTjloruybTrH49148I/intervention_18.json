We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV, and then a second TV being delivered. The author claimed the second one as their own, sold it, and a roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two roommates. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the original TV and split the profits. Then, a second TV arrived, identical but different brand. The author decided to sell it, and the roommate wanted to buy it, but the author sold it elsewhere. Now the roommate is upset, demanding her share of the money from the second TV.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong in claiming the second TV as theirs. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the TV was ordered under the author's account, they might have ownership unless there was an agreement stating otherwise. However, since the cost was split, maybe there's a shared ownership aspect. But the second TV was an accident at Amazon's end\u2014maybe the author found out they were getting two TVs accidentally. \n\nEthically, the roommates contributed to the original purchase. The author might have thought the second TV was their property because it was ordered under their name, but the fact that the cost was split complicates things. The agreement was about the original TV; the second one wasn't part of that agreement. However, the second TV was a free bonus, which wasn't anticipated. The author might not have considered that the roommates could have a claim to the second TV since they also paid for the first one.\n\nThe roommate argues they're entitled to a portion because they contributed to the original purchase leading to the second one. If the second TV is due to the order made with their shared money, maybe they have a right to a share. But if the error was on Amazon's side, perhaps the author is the sole recipient of the mistake's benefit. However, the shared contribution might imply shared ownership in the purchase mistake.\n\nAlso, the author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, even though the original agreement was only about the first TV. The roommate's frustration comes from feeling excluded from the decision about the second TV. Even if the author thought they owned it, not involving the others could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the second TV's delivery was a result of the shared purchase, so the roommates might have a claim to it. The author didn't consider their contribution to the original order, which might have caused the error. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
