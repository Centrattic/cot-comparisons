We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered the TV through their Amazon Prime. Then, by accident, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author decided to sell the second one, and the roommate kept trying to buy it from them. The author sold it, and then the roommate got angry, demanding a cut of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the second TV. The original TV was purchased with shared funds, so even though the author ordered it, the TV is a joint purchase. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The key question is whether the second TV is considered the author's personal item or a mistake that should be handled by the group.\n\nWhen the author ordered the TV under their Amazon account, maybe the second one was a duplicate shipment. But since the cost was split three ways, the initial purchase was a joint effort. However, the second TV wasn't paid for by anyone, so it's a free item. The problem is whether the author had the right to claim it without consulting the roommates.\n\nThe author thought it was theirs because the original was ordered under their name. But the original was a shared purchase. The second TV, being a mistake, might belong to the house collectively. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV, which could be a problem. The roommate who tried to buy it was acting under the assumption that the author had the right to sell it, but if the author didn't actually have sole ownership, then selling it without consultation is an issue.\n\nThe other roommate didn't have a problem, but one was upset. The author's reasoning is that the original was under their name, so they assumed the second one was also theirs. But maybe the ownership of the first TV was a joint purchase, so the second one should be handled collectively as well. The author's decision to sell it without discussing with the roommates, especially when one was insistent on buying it, might have been a mistake.\n\nThe author's action could be seen as not considering the roommates' potential interest in the second TV. Even if the author paid for the first one, the second one's ownership might be ambiguous. Since the original purchase was a shared expense, the mistake might be considered a windfall for the house, not just the author. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not splitting the proceeds or discussing the second TV with the roommates first.\n"
