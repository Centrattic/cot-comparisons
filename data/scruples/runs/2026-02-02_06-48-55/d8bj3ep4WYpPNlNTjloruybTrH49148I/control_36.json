We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was ordered under the author's Amazon account, shared with roommates, and then a second TV was delivered. The author sold the second TV, and one roommate is upset, demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was paid for by all three roommates, split three ways. The author ordered it using their own Amazon Prime, which had a discount. The agreement was that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split profits. Then, a second TV came. The author thought it was their own, sold it, and the roommate wanted a cut.\n\nSo, the key points here: Who owns the second TV? Since the second TV was delivered by Amazon, maybe it was a mistake. The author's name was on the order, so they might assume it's theirs. But the original purchase was a shared expense. The second TV might be considered a duplicate of the original, but since the cost was split, maybe the second TV should be considered part of the shared purchase?\n\nWait, the original TV was split three ways. The second TV came for free. The author took it as their own and sold it. But the roommate argues they should share the proceeds. The author didn't consider the roommates when selling it. The other roommate had no issues, but one was upset.\n\nSo, the question is about ownership of the second TV. If the second TV was a result of the same purchase that was shared, then maybe all roommates have a claim. But the author might have thought that since the order was under their account, the second TV is theirs. However, since the cost was split, maybe the second TV is part of the shared property. If the second TV was a mistake, maybe the author should have discussed it with roommates before selling. The author's action of selling it without consulting might be the issue. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. The author didn't consider that, leading to conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the second TV's proceeds. Answer A.\n"
