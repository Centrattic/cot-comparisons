We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake and then selling it without considering splitting the profit with their roommate.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person moved into a house with two roommates. They agreed to split the cost of a TV. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, two TVs were delivered. The second one was a different brand but similar features. The author thought it was theirs and sold it, while one roommate kept trying to buy it but the author refused. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate got upset and demanded her share. The other roommate didn't mind.\n\nSo the key points are: the TV was bought under the author's account, but the cost was split three ways. The second TV was an error. The author assumed ownership and sold it, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me think about ownership. The original TV was paid for by all three roommates. The second TV was a mistake, so ownership isn't clear. If the TV was delivered to the house, it's the house's property, even if the order was placed under the author's name. Since the order was part of a shared expense, maybe the second TV should be considered communal property. But the author didn't share the second TV's proceeds, leading to conflict.\n\nThe roommate argued she was entitled to her share, which might be based on the idea that since the original purchase was a shared expense, the mistake (second TV) should also be shared. But the author might argue that since the order was under their name, the mistake is their responsibility. But the original purchase was a joint decision.\n\nAnother angle: when the second TV arrived, the author assumed ownership without discussing with roommates. Even if the order was under their name, since the cost was split, the second TV's ownership isn't clear. The roommate might feel that since the original purchase was a shared expense, the mistake should benefit all three.\n\nAlso, the author sold the TV without consulting the roommates, which could be seen as not respecting their shared living arrangement. Even if the author thought it was theirs, not communicating with roommates about a valuable item could be problematic.\n\nThe roommate's reaction is based on feeling entitled because of the shared cost. The author might not have considered that sharing the cost could imply shared ownership of the item, even if ordered by one person. So, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds.\n\nBut the other roommate didn't have an issue, so maybe there's some ambiguity. However, the main conflict is with one roommate. The author's reasoning was that the original purchase was under their name, but the mistake's ownership isn't clear. The fact that the roommate tried to buy it from the author suggests she felt it was a communal asset, hence her entitlement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the second TV's ownership wasn't clearly established, and since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second TV should have been considered communal. The author didn't consider the shared responsibility and should have discussed the second TV with the roommates before selling it.\n"
