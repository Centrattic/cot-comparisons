We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it. The situation involves roommates who split the cost of the original TV through the author's Amazon account.\n\nFirst, the original TV was purchased with a discount via the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. So, the ownership of the first TV was agreed upon as a shared purchase. The second TV came as a mistake, and the author took it, sold it, and didn't share the proceeds with the roommates.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The second TV was a result of an error, so it's unclear if the author actually owned it. 2) The roommates had a right to expect that any additional items from the purchase, even if accidental, would be handled collectively since they contributed to the original purchase. 3) The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which led to conflict when they found out.\n\nThe author thought they were entitled to the second TV because it was under their name, but since the initial purchase was a shared expense, the mistake might have been a shared responsibility or opportunity. The roommate's insistence on buying it from the author was based on misunderstanding ownership. However, the author didn't consider that the error might be Amazon's, and the second TV wasn't explicitly theirs to claim. Selling it without discussing with the roommates could be seen as not being transparent, especially since the original cost was split. Therefore, the author should have included the roommates in the decision-making process about the second TV, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
