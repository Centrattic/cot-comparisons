We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime because of a discount. They agreed that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was also a 55\" 4K smart TV, which they didn't expect.\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs and suggested selling it. Another roommate tried to buy it from them but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else. The roommate who tried to buy it got upset, thinking they were entitled to a share of the money. The other roommate didn't mind. The author believes the TV was theirs to sell since it was under their name.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether the author acted wrong by not sharing the proceeds from the second TV. The key points here are the ownership of the original TV and the second one. The original TV was a joint purchase, so splitting costs and profits makes sense. But the second TV came as a mistake from Amazon. The author might have assumed it was theirs because it had their name on it, but maybe they should have checked if it was a result of a delivery error or a duplicate order.\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways, so the cost was shared. If Amazon sent two TVs due to an error, was the second one also purchased by them? Or was it a mistake in delivery? If the original TV was ordered by the author but the payment was split, maybe the second TV is a mistake by Amazon, which might actually belong to the author. But if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a claim? Or does the mistake mean the second TV is the author's to handle?\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered under their name. But if the original purchase was a joint expense, maybe the second one is also a joint property? Wait, no\u2014the original TV was ordered under the author's account, but the cost was split. So the initial purchase was a shared expense. However, the second TV wasn't ordered, so it's an unexpected delivery. The author might have a claim over it since it was sent to their account. However, the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the initial purchase, the second TV should be shared as well.\n\nBut the problem is that the second TV wasn't ordered. So it's unclear who owns it. The author might have a case if they were the one who placed the order and the extra TV was a mistake. But maybe the roommates contributed to the original order, so the second TV could be considered part of the joint purchase. Or maybe it's an error, so the author has to return it, but they sold it instead. If the author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, that could be an issue, especially if the roommates had a right to a share.\n\nWait, the author split the cost of the original TV, which was necessary to get the discount. The second TV wasn't ordered, so maybe it's a mistake. If the author kept it, maybe they should have informed the roommates. But the author thought it was theirs because it was delivered under their name. The roommate who tried to buy it might have assumed it was part of the shared purchase, hence their entitlement. The other roommate didn't mind, so maybe they thought it was the author's.\n\nThe core issue is whether the second TV was part of the joint purchase or a mistake. Since it was a mistake, the author might have a claim to it. However, since the original purchase was joint, the mistake might have affected all of them. If the second TV was a result of the original order (maybe a duplicate), the roommates might feel they have a right to it. But the author ordered it under their account and sold it, which could be seen as taking advantage of the situation without consulting everyone.\n\nBut the author didn't think the roommates had a right to the money. The roommate was upset because she felt entitled. The author might be in the wrong because even if the second TV was a mistake, the roommates might have contributed to the original cost and thus expect a share. Alternatively, if the second TV was a separate item not ordered by anyone, the author could have handled it as their own.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The key factors are whether the second TV was part of the joint purchase and if the author should have shared the proceeds. Since the original TV was a joint purchase, maybe the second TV, being an error, should be considered communal. The author might have made an assumption without discussing it with everyone, leading to conflict. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering the roommates' potential claims. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the second TV was a mistake and the author was the one who ordered it, they might have the right to handle it. The problem is the author didn't consider the roommates' expectations. So maybe A is the right answer.\n"
