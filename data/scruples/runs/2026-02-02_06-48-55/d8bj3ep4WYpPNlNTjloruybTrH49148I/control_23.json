We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The key points from the situation are:\n\n1. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways among roommates.\n2. The second TV was a free bonus, identical in features but different brand.\n3. The author decided to sell the second TV, not needing it, and didn't share the profits with the roommates. One roommate was upset and felt entitled to a share, while the other wasn't.\n4. The author believed the second TV was theirs to do with as they wished since the original purchase was under their name.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong in not sharing the proceeds from the second TV. Let's think about the agreements made. The original agreement was that when moving out, the TV would be sold and profits split. However, the second TV was an unexpected delivery. The original purchase was split costs, so maybe the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author didn't owe the roommates anything because the second TV wasn't part of the initial purchase. The roommate's claim is based on a sense of entitlement, but there was no prior agreement about the bonus TV. The author might have a point in thinking it's their own to handle, especially since they were the one who ordered it. However, maybe there's an implicit expectation of shared ownership since it was for a shared space. But since the second TV was an accident, perhaps the author isn't obligated to share it. The other roommate didn't have an issue, which suggests maybe the problem was only with one person. The author might not be in the wrong if there was no agreement on the second TV. But maybe they should have discussed it with everyone. However, since the original purchase was split, maybe the bonus is considered a separate item. Hmm. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have an agreement about the second TV, and since it was their purchase, they can handle it as they see fit. The roommate's reaction is unfair since there was no prior agreement.\n"
