We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV, and then receiving a second one by accident. The author sold the second TV and didn't share the profits with one of the roommates, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So all three roommates contributed to the purchase. The second TV, which was a mistake, was sold by the author without consulting the others. The roommate who tried to buy it was persistent but the author refused, and eventually sold it to someone else. The other roommate didn't mind, but the one who tried to buy it is upset and feels entitled to a share of the money.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the original TV was ordered under their name, they owned the second one too. However, the cost was shared, so maybe the ownership of the second TV isn't clear. The problem here is whether the bonus TV was a result of a mistake by Amazon. Since the original order was split among roommates, the bonus might be considered part of the shared purchase, meaning all three have a claim to it. \n\nWhen the author sold the second TV, they didn't share the proceeds. The roommate who tried to buy it felt entitled because they might have thought the bonus TV was part of their shared purchase. The author didn't consider that the bonus might belong to all three, so selling it without splitting the proceeds could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut the author argues that the purchase was under their name, so they had the right to it. However, since the cost was shared, maybe the ownership isn't solely the author's. Also, the initial agreement was that any profits from selling the original TV would be split. The bonus TV might be considered an unexpected gain from the shared purchase, so splitting that makes sense. \n\nThe key issue is whether the bonus TV was a separate item from the original. If Amazon delivered two TVs due to an error, then the second one might not be the author's to dispose of unless they clarify ownership with all roommates. The author's decision to sell it without consulting everyone could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the money from the sale wasn't shared. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the bonus TV was part of the shared purchase, and therefore the proceeds should be split. Even if the original was under their name, the shared cost and the nature of the mistake might mean the bonus belongs to all. The author should have discussed it with everyone before selling.\n"
