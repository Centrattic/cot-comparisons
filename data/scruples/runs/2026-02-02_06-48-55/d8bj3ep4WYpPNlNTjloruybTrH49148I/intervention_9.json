We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (AITA) is at fault for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and selling it.\n\nFirst, the setup: They and two roommates split the cost of a TV via Amazon, ordered by the author. Then a second TV arrived, possibly a mistake. The author decided to sell the second TV, and one roommate was upset about not getting a cut. The author argues the TV was theirs to sell because they ordered it, but the roommate wanted to buy it and later got angry when it was sold to someone else.\n\nSo, the key points are: The original TV was a shared purchase, but the second one came as an error. The author claims the second TV as their own because they were the one who ordered it. The roommate felt entitled to a share in the proceeds. The author didn't consider the roommate's entitlement.\n\nNow, considering the situation. When something is ordered as part of a group purchase, even if one person placed the order, the responsibility and ownership might be shared. The second TV arrived as an error, but since the original purchase was a joint effort, the second one might be considered part of the same transaction. However, the error could mean it's a separate item. If the delivery was an accident, maybe the store sent an extra. But the author treated it as their own, sold it, and the roommate wanted a share.\n\nOwnership is tricky here. If the original order was for a single TV that was mistakenly sent two, then the second might be the store's error. The author might not have the right to sell it, as it's not theirs. But if the second TV was a separate item, perhaps the author could claim it. However, since the purchase was a shared expense, even the second TV might be considered joint property. The roommates contributed to the original purchase, so perhaps the second TV should be treated the same way. The author didn't consult the roommates before selling the second TV, leading to conflict.\n\nThe roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Since the original cost was split three ways, maybe the second TV is also a shared asset. The author might have a right to the TV since they ordered it, but the mistake could mean the store's property. Alternatively, the author might not have considered the shared nature of the original purchase, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author probably should have discussed the second TV with the roommates. The initial agreement was to split profits when selling any TVs. However, the second TV was an error, so maybe it's the author's to handle. But if the error is Amazon's, the author might not have the right to claim it. If the author kept it, they might have to return it, but since they sold it, there's a problem.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the second TV was part of the original order. If it was an error, perhaps the author shouldn't have kept it. But if it was a legitimate mistake (like a duplicate), the author might have a claim. However, the roommates might still have a claim since the original purchase was shared. The author's decision to sell it without discussing led to the conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting and for not considering the shared nature of the initial purchase. The answer would be A (Yes)."
