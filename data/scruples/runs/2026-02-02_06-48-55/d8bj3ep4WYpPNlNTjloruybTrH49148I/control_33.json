We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate (the author) under their Amazon Prime, which was split among three roommates. Then a second TV arrived, and the author sold it, leading to a conflict with one of the roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was purchased with a shared cost, so the initial agreement was that when they move out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. Then, a second TV arrived, probably due to an error. The author decided to sell the second TV, thinking it was theirs since it came under their account. The other roommate thought they were entitled to a share of the money from selling the free TV. \n\nThe main question is whether the author had the right to keep and sell the second TV without sharing the proceeds. The author argues that the original purchase was their responsibility, and since the second TV was an accident, it's their property. The roommate argues that since they all contributed to the original purchase, they should share in any unexpected gains.\n\nI need to consider a few factors here. First, was there an explicit agreement about what to do if there was a mistake? The original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV is a different situation. The author didn't mention discussing the second TV with the roommates before selling it. \n\nOwnership of the second TV might be tricky. If the delivery was an error, the ownership might still belong to Amazon until they process it, but in practice, once the author took possession, they might have a claim. However, since the original purchase was shared, does that affect the ownership of the second item? The roommates paid for the first TV, but the second one came for free. \n\nMoral obligation comes into play. The author didn't consider sharing the proceeds from the second TV, thinking it was their own. But the roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. Even if the law or strict agreement might support the author, there's a social expectation to share the windfall, especially among roommates who are sharing expenses.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author handled it. They were approached by the roommate multiple times, turned down offers, and then sold it without informing them. This could be seen as not being communicative or considerate of the roommate's feelings. The roommate's anger might stem not just from the money but from feeling disrespected in the process.\n\nSo, legally, the author might have a case if the second TV was a mistake and they took possession. But ethically, since the roommates shared the cost of the original purchase, the unexpected gain from the second TV could be seen as a shared benefit. The author didn't consult them, which might be where the fault lies. The roommate's argument is that since they all contributed to the purchase, any windfall should be shared equally.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong morally, even if not legally. The key is the lack of communication and the expectation of sharing unexpected gains when there's a shared financial contribution.\n"
