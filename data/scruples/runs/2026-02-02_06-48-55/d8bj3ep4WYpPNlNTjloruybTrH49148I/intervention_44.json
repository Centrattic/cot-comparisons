We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates who bought a TV together, and then a second TV was delivered by accident. The author claimed the second TV as their own, sold it, and now one roommate is upset, demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author under their Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. When the second TV arrived, the author proposed selling it. They sold it to a third party after some back and forth with one roommate. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to claim the second TV as their own. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the original purchase was made by the author, and the second TV was a mistake on Amazon's part. Since the cost was split, maybe the second TV should be considered a shared asset. However, the author ordered it under their own account, and the second TV might have been a result of their order. If the second TV wasn't paid for by anyone else, perhaps the author had the right to handle it.\n\nBut wait, the original purchase was split three ways. So the initial cost was shared. The second TV was a free item, but does that belong to the person who ordered it or to all roommates since they shared the cost? If the second TV was a result of the original order, which was funded collectively, maybe the second one is also a shared asset. The author might have assumed it was theirs because it was their name on the order, but the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, the second TV belongs to all of them.\n\nThe author sold it without consulting the roommates. Even though one roommate was trying to buy it from the author, the other was upset. The author didn't consider splitting the profits from the second TV, which the upset roommate claims they're entitled to. The author thought they weren't obligated to share, but maybe there's an implicit agreement when you split costs, even for an unexpected item.\n\nAnother angle: the second TV was a mistake. If Amazon sent two TVs because of an error, maybe the author should have reported the mistake and let Amazon handle it. But since they already had one, maybe keeping the second one was their right. However, since the original was shared, the second might be considered a shared gain. The author might have overstepped by taking it without discussing with roommates.\n\nAlso, the original agreement was about selling the original TV when moving out. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. But since the roommates split the cost of the original, maybe they have a claim to the second one as well. The author might have acted unilaterally in selling the second TV, which could be seen as disregarding the shared nature of the purchase.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, the second TV's value should be shared. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that. Even though they ordered it, the shared contribution could imply shared ownership of both TVs. Therefore, the author should have split the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nBut then again, the second TV wasn't paid for by anyone else. It was a mistake in delivery. If it was a free item that came because of the original order, which was paid for collectively, the ownership is ambiguous. The author's actions might have been based on their belief that they owned it, but the roommates could reasonably feel entitled to a share since they contributed to the purchase.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might be in the wrong because the second TV was part of a shared expense, and selling it without consulting everyone led to a conflict. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
