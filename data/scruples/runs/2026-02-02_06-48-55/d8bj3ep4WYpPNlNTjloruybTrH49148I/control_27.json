We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author decided to sell the second one, and one roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author sold it instead. The roommate got upset and felt entitled to a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They split the cost, and agreed that when they move out, they'd sell it and split the profits. So the original TV was a shared purchase. But the second TV was a mistake from Amazon. The question is whether the second TV is the author's to do with as they please or if it's also a shared asset.\n\nThe author ordered the TV under their Amazon account, so maybe they think they have a claim to the second one. But since the original purchase was a group decision and the cost was split, perhaps the second TV is also part of that shared purchase. Even though it was a mistake, the cost of the original TV was split, so the second TV might be considered an unexpected windfall for the group. However, the author might argue that since they were the one who ordered it, the second TV is theirs to handle. But the problem is that the original order was for a TV that the roommates were contributing to, so maybe the second TV is also part of that shared purchase. \n\nThe author sold it without consulting the roommates, which might be the issue. Even if the author thought they had the right, the roommate felt entitled because they paid a third of the original TV's cost. The author's action of selling it without agreement could be seen as not considering the roommates' contributions. The roommate's insistence on a portion of the money might be based on the idea that they contributed to the original purchase, so any additional items from that order (even if a mistake) should be shared. \n\nBut the original purchase was for one TV. The second TV was an error. So the cost of the original TV was split, but the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might have the right to the second TV since it was their account and they might have accidentally ordered two, but the roommates might feel that since they were part of the original purchase, they have a claim. \n\nAnother angle: if the second TV was a mistake, maybe the author should have checked with the roommates before selling. The author's decision to sell it and not share the proceeds might be the problem. Even if the author thought it was theirs, the roommate felt entitled, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, maybe the author is at fault for not discussing the second TV with the roommates. The initial agreement was about the original TV, but the second one wasn't part of that. However, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, they might feel a connection to any additional items. The key point is whether the second TV was a separate item that the author had sole claim over or if it's part of the shared purchase. \n\nGiven that the second TV was a mistake, and the author ordered it under their own account, perhaps the author does have the right to it. However, the roommates might feel that since they were part of the original purchase, any additional items (even by mistake) should be shared. The author's failure to consult them and sell it without their input could be the issue. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering that the roommates might have a claim, even if it wasn't explicitly agreed upon. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong) might be appropriate.\n"
