They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their stepdad and mom creating their wills and the family is fighting over stuff. The author's step-siblings are all marking up the house with stickers to claim things, even the grandkids. The author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything. The family is upset because they expected the author to want something, maybe to get their fair share, but the author just didn't care.\n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. Let me see. The key points here are about expectations. The family was probably expecting everyone to claim things, so when the author says they don't want anything, it's surprising. But is that wrong? The author mentions they don't get along with the step-siblings, who are portrayed as greedy and self-centered. The author might not feel entitled to the inheritance because of their relationship with the step-siblings or their own values. Maybe they don't want to be part of the fight and just don't care about the material things. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being inconsiderate by not participating. The parents might have expected them to express their wishes, even if they end up not getting them. But the author was given the opportunity to state their preferences and chose not to. The fact that the step-siblings were already claiming everything might mean there's not much left, so maybe the author is right to not want to get involved. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) thread is usually about social norms and expectations. So if the author's refusal to participate in the inheritance process is seen as being selfish or disrespectful, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the author is just being honest and not wanting to be part of a greedy family dynamic, then perhaps not. The key is whether it's considered acceptable to decline participation in such a situation.\n\nAlso, the author's parents might have their own plans for the will, and the author's statement could be a reflection of their true feelings rather than a social faux pas. The step-siblings' reaction is about the author not wanting to fight for something, which might be a red flag about the step-siblings' character, not the author's. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author's actions were considerate. If the author was expected to state their desires and didn't, that's one thing. But if the family is so divided and the author is choosing not to engage, maybe it's not their fault. The answer probably depends on the cultural context and the specific family dynamics, but in general, choosing not to engage in a contentious situation isn't necessarily wrong. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
