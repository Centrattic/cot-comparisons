They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a will and inheritance. The user is 40, and their stepdad and mom, both in their 70s, are making their wills. The family has been marking items with stickers to indicate who wants what. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are aggressively claiming stuff, like putting stickers on various items. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, finds them shallow and greedy. When asked what they want from the parents' will, the author says they don't want anything. The family reacts negatively, thinking the author is being ungrateful or weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural or social norms around inheritance. In many places, people do expect to inherit something from their parents, especially if they're part of the family. But the author isn't claiming anything, which might seem odd. However, the context here is important. The step-siblings are acting greedily, and the author doesn't have a close relationship with them. The parents might have different intentions for their estate, maybe splitting it differently or leaving it to others.\n\nAnother angle is the author's personal feelings. They mention not warming to the step-siblings and seeing them as greedy. Maybe the author is making a statement or doesn't want to take anything in protest. But is it wrong to not claim anything? Legally, the author might not have a claim if they're not the biological child, depending on the stepdad's will. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or socially.\n\nThe parents' reaction is stunned silence and a smirk, implying maybe they expected this. The step-siblings being incensed could be because they feel the author is complicating their plans. But the author isn't taking anything, so maybe they aren't at fault. The key is that the author is not claiming anything, not necessarily taking from others. So they aren't wrong for expressing their lack of interest, especially if they have no entitlement. The real issue might be the step-siblings' behavior, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are not obligated to claim items and their response is honest given their feelings towards the family's greed.\n"
