They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (L) is at fault for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family has been marking items with stickers, dividing up the house like it's already theirs. The step-siblings and even grandparents are eyeing specific items. L doesn't get along with step-siblings, finds them self-absorbed and greedy. When asked what they want, L says nothing, leading to a stunned reaction and accusations from the others.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether L's response was wrong. The parents might have expected L to claim something to balance things out, especially if they had prior discussions. But L's stance is that they don't want anything because everything's already taken, and they don't like the step-siblings.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some families, not wanting anything might be seen as disrespectful or strange, but others might respect a person's choice. L's parents might have intended for the items to be divided among family, but L's refusal could disrupt that. However, L is within their rights to decline. They aren't claiming they want something others want, just that they don't want anything. The step-siblings being upset is more about their own greed than L's decision.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction\u2014mom smirking\u2014suggests they might have anticipated this. Maybe they prefer L's approach over the step-siblings' greed. L isn't doing anything wrong by stating their preference, even if others are upset. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
