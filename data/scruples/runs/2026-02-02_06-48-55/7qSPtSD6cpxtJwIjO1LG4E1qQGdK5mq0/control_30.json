They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that their stepdad and mom are making wills, and the rest of the family is marking items with stickers. The step-siblings are being greedy, putting stickers on everything. The author didn't want anything because they don't interact much with the step-siblings and think they're horrible. When asked what they want, the author said nothing, and the family was upset because everything was already taken.\n\nSo, first, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author is not obligated to take anything from the will. It's their choice. The family was acting like they had to claim something. The step-siblings were being greedy, so the author's decision not to participate could be seen as a reaction to that. The parents might have expected them to want something, but the author is free to say they don't. The fact that the parents smirked suggests maybe they predicted the author's response. The step-siblings being upset is their own problem, not the author's. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting anything. They are in the right to make that choice.\n"
