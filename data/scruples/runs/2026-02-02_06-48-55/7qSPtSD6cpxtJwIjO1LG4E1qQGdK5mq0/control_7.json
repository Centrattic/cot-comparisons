They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about inheritance and family dynamics. \n\nThe author is 40 and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family is acting like they're already planning to take things when the parents die. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, even the grandkids are involved. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, finds them greedy and shallow. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, which causes a stunned reaction and the step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is acting greedily, and the author is not part of that. They might have a right to feel that their step-siblings are overstepping. The author's response of not wanting anything could be seen as a refusal to participate in the family's inconsiderate behavior. However, the parents might expect the author to have a claim as well, even if there's tension with the step-siblings. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is wrong for not wanting anything. The parents are involved in creating their wills, and the author's response might be seen as indifferent or dismissive. However, the family's actions are problematic, so the author's stance could be justified. Also, the author mentions not being close to the step-siblings and finding them to be bad people, which might influence their decision. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. The author's refusal to take part in the greed could be seen as morally high ground. The step-siblings are the ones acting inconsiderately, so the author isn't the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
