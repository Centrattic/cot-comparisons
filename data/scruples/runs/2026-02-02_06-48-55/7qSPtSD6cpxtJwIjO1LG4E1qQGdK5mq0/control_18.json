They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation involves their stepfather and mother creating wills, and the step-siblings are already marking items they want. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who are acting greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, causing the step-siblings to get angry because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are creating wills, which is a legal document, but the family is acting as if they can claim items during the parents' lifetime. That's not legal, of course, since the will only takes effect after death. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, which is just their own way of claiming them, but it's not binding. The author is uninterested in participating in this game, which shows they might not value material things or want to get involved in family conflict.\n\nThe parents asked the author what they wanted, and the author declined. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author would be a source of conflict or maybe expected them to take something. But the author's response was honest. Is the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, they have the right to choose not to take anything. The parents might be disappointed, but the author isn't obligated to take items. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and perhaps feeling threatened if the author might take something they wanted.\n\nThe author's relationship with the step-siblings is strained, which adds context. They don't feel close to them and see them as self-centered. The parents might have a prior conversation where the mother was smirking, implying she expected the author's response. The author's answer was truthful and not manipulative. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to take anything and are being honest about their lack of interest. The step-siblings' anger is misplaced. So the answer is B.\n"
