They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the whole family is acting like they're already dividing up the inheritance. The step-siblings are marking things with stickers, and even the grandkids are getting into it. The author didn't want anything, so when asked, they said they don't want anything. The family reacted negatively, and the parents seemed smug about it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The family is being greedy and acting entitled, which is pretty clear from the description. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're bad people. When given the chance to take things, the author declines. That seems reasonable. The author isn't being greedy; they're actually avoiding the conflict and the family's avarice. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the parents expected the author to take something, and by not doing so, they're causing a stir. However, the author had no prior indication that they were supposed to take something. The family was just acting out, and the author simply said they didn't want to participate. It's their choice. Inheritance is about what the decedent wants to leave, not what others expect. The author isn't claiming anything, which is their right. The step-siblings are being unreasonable by being upset that someone doesn't want to join their greed. \n\nThe parents' reaction might be because they were expecting the author to take something, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. It's the parents' decision what to leave, not the family's. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're being honest and not participating in the family's entitlement. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
