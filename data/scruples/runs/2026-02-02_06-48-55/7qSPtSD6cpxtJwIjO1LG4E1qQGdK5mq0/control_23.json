They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are actively sorting through belongings, marking items with stickers, and there's a lot of conflict over who gets what. The author didn't participate in this and when asked what they want, said nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dynamics here. The author is a stepchild who doesn't get along with the step-siblings, finding them greedy and self-absorbed. The parents are creating their wills and polling the family. When asked what the author wants, they decline. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would claim something. The parents seem to have a prior conversation where the mom smirks, implying maybe she agreed with the author's response.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's response is honest about not wanting to participate in the scramble for possessions. The step-siblings are more entitled and focused on claiming items. The parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author refuses. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, people have the right to decline inheritance if they don't want it. There's no obligation to take anything from a will. The family's approach of marking items seems chaotic and possibly disrespectful. The author's refusal could be seen as a stand against the greed they observe. However, maybe the parents expected their children (including stepchildren) to want something, but the author's relationship is strained. \n\nThe step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and entitlement, not the author's right to decline. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest. They aren't required to participate in what they see as a materialistic and disrespectful process. The parents might be disappointed, but the author isn't morally wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
