They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their stepdad and mom creating wills and the family marking items they want. The step-siblings and even the kids are putting stickers on stuff like they're claiming it. The author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything. The family gets upset, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are making their wills, and the family is being very forward about claiming items. The author isn't close to their step-siblings and thinks they're greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing. The family is upset because they expected the author to claim stuff, but the author didn't. The parents might have had a prior discussion, as the mom smirked at the stepdad.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to want anything from their parents' estate. Inheritance is a personal choice. The family's behavior seems greedy and maybe even inappropriate, marking items in advance. The author's response could be a way of not engaging in the family's avarice. They might not want to take anything because of the negative atmosphere or their feelings toward the step-siblings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated differently or tried to claim items even if they didn't want them. But the key point is that the author isn't required to take anything. The family's reaction might stem from their own expectations, but the author isn't wrong for choosing not to participate in the scramble. The parents might have their own plans, and the author's honesty isn't a problem. The step-siblings' greed is their own issue, not the author's responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. They have the right to decide not to take anything, especially given the context of the family's behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
