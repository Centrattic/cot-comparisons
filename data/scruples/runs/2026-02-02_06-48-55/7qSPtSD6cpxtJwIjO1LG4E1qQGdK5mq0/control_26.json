They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about their parents creating a will and the family fighting over possessions. The author says they don't want anything from the will and got a negative reaction from their step-siblings and parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are in their 70s and are making their wills. The step-siblings are already marking items with stickers, showing they're eager to claim things. The author says they don't want anything, which surprises everyone. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take some items. The parents might have expected the author to want something, but the author didn't.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, people can have different reasons. Maybe they don't need the items, or they don't want to be involved in the family conflict. The step-siblings seem greedy and self-centered, according to the author. The parents might be biased towards their own children (the step-siblings) if they're dividing assets that way. The author might feel that their relationship with the step-siblings is already strained, so avoiding the conflict makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents expected their own child (the author) to want something, especially if they're part of the family. But the author's step-siblings are already taking things, so perhaps there's an assumption that the author would claim their share. However, the author might not see the value in material goods and prefer not to take part in the squabbling.\n\nLegally, the parents can decide how to distribute their assets as they see fit. The author isn't obligated to want anything, so their response is their choice. The step-siblings' reaction could be selfish, as they might not realize they're being greedy. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their feelings honestly. They might not owe explanations to the family about their preferences. The parents' smirk suggests they might have known the author wouldn't take anything, which could indicate they expected this response.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decline taking anything from the will, especially given the family's behavior. Their decision doesn't affect the distribution, and they're not obligated to participate in the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
