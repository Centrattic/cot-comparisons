They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The context is about a family creating wills and the author not wanting anything from their parents' estate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's stepdad and mom are in their 70s and setting up wills. The family is actively discussing what each person would want. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, each taking what they want, and even the grandchildren are doing the same. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and doesn't hang out with them much. They find the step-siblings to be self-absorbed and focused on greed.\n\nAt a family dinner, when asked what they want from their parents' will, the author says they don't want anything. The reaction is negative, with the step-siblings being upset because they thought everything was already taken. The parents seem to have a prior discussion where the mom smirked at the stepdad, suggesting maybe the author was right in some way.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nNow, considering the situation. The author is not claiming any specific items and is not participating in the scramble for possessions. The step-siblings are acting greedily, marking items, and the author is not part of that. The parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author is content with their own life. \n\nIn terms of morality, is it wrong to not want anything from your parents? If the author is not being greedy, but rather is honest about not wanting the items that others are fighting over, it's more about personal choice. The step-siblings are the ones acting in a vapid, avaricious way. The author is not taking anything, so they are not in the wrong. The parents might be upset because they thought the author should have a say, but the author's response is honest. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author is not wrong for declining to participate in what seems like a chaotic and materialistic distribution of assets. Their refusal is a personal choice and not unethical given the context of the family's behavior.\n"
