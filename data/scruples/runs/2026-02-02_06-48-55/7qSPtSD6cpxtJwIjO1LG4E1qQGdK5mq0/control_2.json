They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nSo, the situation is that the parents are making their wills and the step-siblings are all over the place, marking up the house with stickers for stuff they want. The author doesn't really get along with them and thinks they're greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks everyone else.\n\nFirst thought: The author isn't taking stuff others have marked. They didn't go around claiming things. They just said they don't want anything. So maybe they're not wrong. But maybe others feel they should have a say in the will, even if others are taking stuff. But the author's parents were the ones creating the wills and asked the author directly. \n\nThe parents might have intended to distribute things according to the will, but the step-siblings are acting like they already own stuff. The author's response could be a way of not getting involved in the family's greed. Also, the author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, which might make their reaction to the author's decision more negative.\n\nBut is there a cultural or family norm where you're supposed to have your own claims? Maybe the parents expected the author to have something they wanted, but the author is being honest. It's possible the author is being blamed for others' greed, which isn't fair. The step-siblings are already taking what they want, and the author isn't interfering. \n\nSo, the author isn't taking anything, just stating they don't want stuff. They might be in the right because they're not greedy and are honest. The real problem is the step-siblings' behavior. The parents might have a right to decide, but the author isn't wrong for not wanting anything. Answer B, No.\n"
