They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong to say you don't want anything from your parents' will. The situation is that the author's step parents are making their wills, and the family is acting like they're already dividing up the inheritance. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, and the author, when asked what they want, says nothing. The step-siblings are upset because they thought everyone would take something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around inheritance. In many cultures, it's expected that children might receive something from their parent's estate, but that's not a universal rule. The author is 40, so maybe they're in a position where they don't need the inheritance. The step-siblings are acting greedy, even taking items that are clearly valuable or have sentimental value. The author might feel that since the step-siblings are already taking so much, there's nothing left, or they just don't want any part of the family's quarrel.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? If the parents asked, the author answered truthfully. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to take something, but the author has different priorities. The parents might be disappointed, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. Also, the step-siblings' behavior is problematic, so maybe the author is justified in not participating in that. On the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in the family that you should take something, and not doing so could be seen as disrespectful. But I think the key point is that the author isn't taking anything, so they aren't causing harm here. The real issue is the step-siblings' behavior, not the author's refusal. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
