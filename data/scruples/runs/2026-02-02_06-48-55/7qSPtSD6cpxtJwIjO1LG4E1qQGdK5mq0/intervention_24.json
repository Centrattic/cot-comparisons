They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a will and family dynamics. The author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating their wills. The family is acting like items in the house are up for grabs, with stickers marking who wants what. The author didn't want anything and got a negative reaction from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The family is being overly greedy, marking up the house with stickers. The author didn't feel attached to the step-siblings and didn't want any of the stuff. When asked what they want, they said nothing, which upset the others. The parents were okay with that, as the mom smirked.\n\nSo, the author isn't taking anything, while others are fighting over stuff. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not claiming anything. \n\nThe possible moral angles here are about entitlement, family obligations, and respect. If the author feels they don't want anything, that's their choice. But maybe the family expects them to take something, or maybe there's an unspoken expectation. However, the story also describes the step-siblings as greedy and the author as not close to them. The parents allowed the author to say nothing, even with the mom's smirk suggesting maybe she agreed.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but others might say it's their choice. The author isn't taking anything, so they aren't doing anything wrong. The step-siblings' reaction might be more about their own greed and expecting others to participate. The author isn't obligated to take stuff they don't want, especially if the family is being inconsiderate. The parents didn't seem upset, which might indicate approval. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author is honest about their feelings and not part of the greedy behavior. The step-siblings' anger is misplaced. The author isn't doing anything wrong by not participating in the family's greed.\n"
