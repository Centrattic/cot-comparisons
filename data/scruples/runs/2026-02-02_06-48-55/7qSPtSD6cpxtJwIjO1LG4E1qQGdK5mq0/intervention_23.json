They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they declined to take anything from their stepdad and mom's will. The family has been marking up the house with stickers to claim items, and the author didn't want anything, leading to a stunned reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are in their 70s, creating wills, and the step-siblings are acting like they're already dividing the estate. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, describing them as self-absorbed and greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which causes the step-siblings to be upset because they thought everything was already claimed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Are there cultural or family expectations here? In many cases, families expect heirs to have some interest in the inheritance, especially if others are actively claiming items. However, the author's response might be a reaction to the step-siblings' behavior. The author could be asserting their independence or not wanting to participate in the conflict. They might not care about the material stuff, which is their choice, but the step-siblings could feel offended or think the author isn't being respectful. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Maybe not, if they genuinely don't care. However, the parents might have expected their child to want something, and the author's refusal could be seen as disrespectful or causing awkwardness. The step-siblings might also feel like the author is now in a better position to take items not claimed, but the author didn't do that. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. The parents were polling the family, so the author might have been expected to participate. By not wanting anything, they might be avoiding family tension, but the parents could be disappointed. The answer depends on whether the author's refusal was disrespectful or a personal choice. Since the author explained they didn't want to get involved and the parents had a prior conversation (mom smirking), maybe the author isn't wrong. They might just not want to partake in the greedy behavior of the others. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check the details again. The author's response was out of the blue for the family, and they didn't claim anything. It's possible the author is in the right to not engage in their family's materialism. The step-siblings' reaction is about their own greed, not the author's wrongdoing. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
