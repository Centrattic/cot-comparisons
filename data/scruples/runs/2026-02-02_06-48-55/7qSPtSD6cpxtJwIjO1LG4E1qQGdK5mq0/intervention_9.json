They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parents creating their wills, and the step-siblings are vying for various items with stickers. The author didn't want anything and got a negative reaction from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are in their 70s, and the step-siblings are acting greedily, even marking items with stickers. The author isn't close to them and finds them to be vapid. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to the step-siblings being upset that the author didn't claim items they thought were already taken.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, legally, the author isn't obligated to claim anything. Emotionally, maybe the family expected them to take something, but the author isn't required to comply. The step-siblings are acting selfishly, so the author's decision not to participate in the competition might be justified. The author's response could be a way of rejecting the family's materialistic behavior. The parents might have their own reasons for the will, and the author's choice not to take anything isn't inherently wrong. It's about personal values and their relationship with the family. So the answer is B.\n"
