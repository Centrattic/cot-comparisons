They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the rest of the family, including step-siblings and grandchildren, are marking items they want. The author didn't want anything and said so, leading to a negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they don't get along with the step-siblings, who they describe as greedy and self-absorbed. The family was already fighting over items, and when the parents asked the author what they wanted, the author declined. The parents then showed some reaction, maybe expecting the author to take something.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal expectation that you should want something from your parents' will? Maybe not necessarily. People can choose to decline inheritance for various reasons. The author might be honest about not wanting material possessions, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings. However, maybe the parents expected the author to take something, leading to the parents' surprise or the step-siblings' anger.\n\nBut the author isn't taking anything, so they aren't wrong for stating their preference. The wrongness would depend on if there's an expectation they were supposed to take something. If the parents had prior discussions or if there's an implied obligation, maybe the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author states they don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings and the family is acting greedy, so the author's choice to not participate might be justified.\n\nThe key points are the author's relationship dynamics, the family's behavior, and the author's right to decline. Since the author isn't obligated to take anything and is being honest about their feelings, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. The step-siblings' reaction might stem from their own greed, not the author's actions. The parents' reaction could be due to unmet expectations, but the author isn't wrong for not conforming to that.\n"
