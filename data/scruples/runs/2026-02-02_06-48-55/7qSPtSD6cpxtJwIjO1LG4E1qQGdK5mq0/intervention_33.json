They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a will and how different family members are acting. So the author says they don't want anything from their parents' will. The family is all over the place with stickers on items, each taking what they want. The author isn't close to the step-siblings, finds them unpleasant, and when asked what they want, they say nothing. The step-siblings get upset because they thought the author would claim something, but everything's already marked.\n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me break it down. The key points are the author's right to disclaim inheritance, their relationship with the step-siblings, and whether their response was appropriate.\n\nFirst, legally, a person can disclaim an inheritance if they don't want anything. The author is within their rights to say they don't want anything from the will. So there's no legal wrong here. But the question is about moral or social wrong, not legal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in terms of social expectations.\n\nThe family is acting greedy, with stickers and fighting over items. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings and sees them as self-absorbed. When asked, the author honestly says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something, but everything's already taken. The author's mom even seems smug, implying maybe she agreed with the author's choice.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to take anything. They might not want to be part of the family's greed. They are being honest, which is usually the right thing. The step-siblings' reaction is about their own greed and maybe feeling slighted because the author isn't playing along. The author's actions don't harm anyone. They didn't lie or take something unfairly. The problem is with the family's behavior, not the author's. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
