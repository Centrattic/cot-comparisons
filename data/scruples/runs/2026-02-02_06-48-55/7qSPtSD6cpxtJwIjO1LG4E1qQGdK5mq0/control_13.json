They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (OP) is at fault for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the OP's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family, including step-siblings, are already marking up items they want. When asked, the OP says they don't want anything, leading to a negative reaction from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is acting greedy and self-centered, with step-siblings fighting over possessions. The OP isn't close to them and sees them as self-absorbed. The OP's response of not wanting anything is in contrast to the others who are aggressively claiming items. \n\nIs the OP wrong for not wanting to participate? Well, people have the right to decline inheritance if they choose. The OP isn't taking anything others want, so they aren't causing conflict in that sense. The family's reaction might be due to their own expectations or greed, but the OP is just stating their own wishes. There's no indication the OP is being disrespectful or causing harm. \n\nThe key points are the OP's right to decline, the context of the family's behavior, and the lack of any negative action from the OP beyond stating their preference. Since the OP isn't taking anything and isn't in a position to be blamed for others' greed, they likely aren't at fault. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
