They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting anything from their parents' will, while the rest of the family is already marking items with stickers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's stepdad and mom are in their 70s and making wills. The extended family is acting like they're already dividing the inheritance, putting stickers on items. The author didn't participate in this, and when asked what they want, said nothing. The step-siblings were upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's decision not to take anything could be seen as a personal choice. They might not value material things or have a different relationship with their parents. However, the family dynamic here is important. The step-siblings are acting greedy and maybe entitled, but the author's response could be perceived as disrespectful or causing conflict if the parents had expectations.\n\nBut the story mentions that the author doesn't get along with the step-siblings and finds them self-absorbed. The author's answer might be a way to avoid conflict or express disapproval of the family's behavior. The parents' reaction was stunned silence, and the step-siblings were incensed. The author might not be wrong for standing by their choice, especially if they genuinely don't want the items. It's their right to decline, and maybe the parents should respect that. However, if there were unspoken expectations, maybe there's a cultural or familial norm that the author isn't considering. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author is making a personal choice. Unless there's an obligation to take something (which isn't mentioned here), they aren't in the wrong. The step-siblings' reaction seems more about their own greed than the author's right choice. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
