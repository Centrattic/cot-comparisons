They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are actively going through the house, marking items with stickers as if they already own them. The step-siblings are even fighting over things they just found out about, like land and snowmobiles. The author, who doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, was asked what they want and said nothing because everything was already taken. The family was shocked, and the step-siblings were upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong by not claiming items. First, the author isn't obligated to take things from their parents' will. It's their choice. The parents were polling others, but when they asked the author, the author felt there was nothing left because the step-siblings had already marked everything. The step-siblings' behavior seems greedy and disrespectful, especially marking items they haven't even known about for long. The author's response might be seen as a stand against that greed. \n\nBut maybe the parents expected the author to have a say, so by not responding, they might feel disrespected. However, the author's reasoning is valid since the items were already marked. Also, the step-siblings' actions are problematic. The parents might have realized the step-siblings are not good people, which is why the mom smirked. So, the author's stance could be justified. The answer is probably B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're not required to take things, and the family's behavior is questionable.\n"
