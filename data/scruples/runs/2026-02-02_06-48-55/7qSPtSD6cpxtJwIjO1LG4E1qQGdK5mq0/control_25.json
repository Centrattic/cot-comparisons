They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the family is already fighting over who gets what. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, like they're already claiming them. The author didn't want anything, and the family was upset because they expected the author to take something. The question is whether the author did something wrong by not wanting anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they don't hang out with the step-siblings much and doesn't like them. They describe the siblings as greedy and self-absorbed. The family is acting like they're already entitled to the items, which is causing tension. The author was asked directly what they want, and they said nothing, which shocked the others.\n\nSo, the author's response was to say they don't want anything. The family was expecting them to take something, maybe to be part of the competition. But the author is choosing not to participate in the conflict. Is that wrong?\n\nI think it's important to consider cultural norms and family expectations. In some families, discussing inheritance and wanting to take things is common. But if the author isn't close to the family and finds their behavior distasteful, maybe it's reasonable to decline. Also, the author might not have a claim in the will if they aren't a biological child, depending on the legal structure, but the question is about moral rightness, not legal.\n\nThe step-siblings are acting greedy, and the author is not complicit in their behavior. By saying they don't want anything, the author is asserting their own values and not engaging in the family's conflict. The parents might have been surprised, but the author isn't required to play along with the family's antics. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. They have the right to decline if they don't want any part of the inheritance fight.\n"
