They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author's parents and step-siblings organizing their wills, with everyone marking items they want. The author doesn't want anything and said so, causing a negative reaction from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the family's behavior, the author's response, and the expectations involved. \n\nThe step-parents and siblings are acting greedily, marking items with stickers, which seems a bit chaotic. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them unpleasant. When asked what they want, the author honestly says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because the author didn't try to claim items. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to participate in the scramble? In terms of ethics, it's about respecting the author's wishes. The parents are allowed to decide their will as they see fit. The author isn't taking anything, so there's no harm. The step-siblings' reaction might be due to their own greed, but the author isn't obligated to act like them. \n\nThe author's response was honest. They didn't want anything, so there's no wrongdoing. The parents might have a different plan, but the author isn't forcing anything. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
