They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their parents' will and how other family members are acting greedily, marking up the house with stickers for inheritance. The author says they don't want anything, and others are upset because they didn't claim stuff.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not wanting to take anything. From the story, the step-siblings are being greedy and self-centered, and the author doesn't feel close to them. They just don't want anything, which leads to others being angry. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author isn't taking things others have claimed, so maybe they aren't at fault. They're not being greedy; they're choosing not to participate in the family's chaotic behavior. The parents might have their own reasons for the will, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. The step-siblings are acting immaturely, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
