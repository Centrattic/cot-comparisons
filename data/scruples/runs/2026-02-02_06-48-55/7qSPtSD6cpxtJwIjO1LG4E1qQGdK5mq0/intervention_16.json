They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting anything from their parents' will, while their step-siblings are fighting over everything with stickers. The parent's step-siblings are acting greedy, and the author is standoffish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's parents and stepdad are creating wills, and the family is marking items with stickers. The step-siblings are really into claiming stuff, even the grandkids. The author isn't close to them and finds them vapid. When asked what they want, the author says nothing. The step-siblings get upset because they thought the author would take something, but the author didn't.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But why? Maybe because the author didn't participate in the process or because they didn't claim something. But the author explains they don't want anything. Is it wrong to not want anything? Maybe not. The problem is whether the author had any obligation. If the author isn't close and doesn't want stuff, then it's their choice. The step-siblings are acting greedy, so the author's refusal might be justified. The parents might be okay with it since the mom smirked. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
