They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. \n\nThe situation is that the person's stepdad and mom, in their 70s, are making their wills. The family is acting like they already expect to inherit, with step-siblings and grandchildren marking items with stickers. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who are described as greedy and shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything's already claimed, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's parents were creating wills, the family was being overly anticipatory, and the author's response was to decline anything when directly asked. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author should be fighting for items. \n\nThe author doesn't want anything, possibly because they feel the items are already claimed or they don't care. The question is whether this is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely don't want the things being fought over. They might feel that the family's behavior is inappropriate, so choosing not to participate could be a way of distancing themselves from the greed. Also, the author's parents might have their own plans for the will, and the step-siblings' actions are premature. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more tactful in their response. But the core issue is whether their refusal is wrong. The step-siblings' reaction suggests they expected the author to claim something, but the author's choice is their own. Unless there's an expectation or obligation to take something, the author's choice to say no seems valid. \n\nAlso, the author's parents might have already had a discussion, as indicated by the mom smirking. That implies the parents might have an idea of the author's stance. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating their preference. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
