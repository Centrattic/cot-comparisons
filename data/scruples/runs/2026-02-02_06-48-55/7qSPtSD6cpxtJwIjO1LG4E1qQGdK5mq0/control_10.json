They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the extended family (step-siblings and their kids) are already marking items they want. The author didn't take part in this and when asked what they want, said nothing. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author should take items since others were claiming them.\n\nFirst, the author is in their 40s, so they're an adult. The parents are in their 70s, so the wills are about estate planning. The step-siblings and their kids are acting greedily, marking up stuff. The author isn't close to them and doesn't want anything. When asked, they honestly say they don't want anything, which surprises the family.\n\nThe key points here: The author isn't taking things others have marked. They're not trying to claim anything. The step-siblings are upset because they assumed the author would take something, but the author is content with their own life and doesn't need or want the inheritance. \n\nLegal rights aside, morally, there's no obligation to take inheritance. The author isn't doing anything to prevent others from getting what they want; they're just opting out. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and entitlement. The author's response is honest and respectful of their own feelings. \n\nThe parents might be handling their wills, but the author isn't interfering. It's about personal choice. There's no indication the author is trying to take anything away. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
