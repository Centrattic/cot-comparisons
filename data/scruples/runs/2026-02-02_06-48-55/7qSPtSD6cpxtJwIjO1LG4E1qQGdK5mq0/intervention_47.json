They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 40-year-old whose stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the entire family is acting like they're about to die soon. The step-siblings and even the grandparents are marking up items in the house with stickers to claim them. The author didn't want anything and said so when asked, which upset the other family members.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The author didn't take part in the claiming process and when asked what they wanted, they said they didn't want anything. The family was expecting everyone to take things, but the author declined. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider different angles. Maybe the family was under the impression that everyone would take things, and the author's refusal came as a surprise. But is that the author's fault? They didn't participate in the sticker game and weren't close to the step-siblings. Also, the author might have felt that the way the family was handling it was greedy or inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have expressed their feelings earlier instead of just saying nothing when asked. However, they did explain that they didn't want anything because everything was already taken. The step-siblings were upset because they expected the author to take something. But the author's stance could be seen as being honest and not wanting to take part in the greed.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had a responsibility to act differently. The family was marking up items, and the author didn't participate. When asked directly, they answered truthfully. The other family members might have been inconsiderate by not respecting the author's wishes, but the author didn't do anything wrong by not wanting to take part. So the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
