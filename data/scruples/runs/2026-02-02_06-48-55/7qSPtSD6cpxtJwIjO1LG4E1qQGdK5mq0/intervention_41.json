They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person is 40, and their stepdad and mom (in their 70s) are creating wills. The family is actively discussing and marking up belongings with stickers, each sibling and grandchild claiming items. The step-siblings and others are acting like they're already shopping for items, even putting stickers on everything from moose heads to Jacuzzis. The author doesn't interact much with the step-siblings and finds them self-absorbed and greedy. During a family dinner, when asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to stunned reactions and step-siblings being upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want anything because the family is acting so materialistic. They didn't participate in the \"shopping\" process, so they're not taking anything. The parents, however, seem to have expected the author to claim something, but the author declined.\n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's the case.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the context. In many cultures, inheritance is a sensitive topic. The step-siblings and others are being greedy, but the author's refusal might be seen as a way to avoid conflict or as a stance against the family's materialism. Alternatively, maybe the parents expected the author to have some interest, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nBut the key points here are that the author isn't being greedy; they're not taking anything because they're not interested. The family is acting like they're already shopping, which the author finds distasteful. The parents asked the author directly, and the author's response was honest about not wanting anything.\n\nIs it wrong to not want anything? It depends on cultural norms and family expectations. However, the author isn't taking something from others; they're just stating their own lack of desire. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed than the author's refusal. The author isn't in the wrong for not participating in the family's materialistic behavior. In fact, the step-siblings might be the ones in the wrong for acting so callously. The author's honesty, while unexpected, isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
