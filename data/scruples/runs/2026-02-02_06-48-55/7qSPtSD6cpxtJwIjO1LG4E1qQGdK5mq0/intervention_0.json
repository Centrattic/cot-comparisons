They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their parents creating wills and the family getting all competitive about who gets what. The author didn't want anything, but the step-siblings were upset because they thought the author should be taking things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are making their wills, the step-siblings are marking items with stickers, acting like they already own them. The author isn't close to them and finds them self-centered. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks the family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. The author's point is that they don't want anything because everything is already taken. The step-siblings were fighting over things they just found out about. The parents might have been expecting the author to jump in and take something, but they didn't. The mother smirked, implying maybe she agreed with the author's stance.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, if you don't want anything, that's your choice. But maybe there's an expectation in family dynamics to take something, especially if others are doing it. However, the author isn't claiming anything that's already been marked. They're not taking from others, just declining to participate. The problem is the step-siblings' reaction. The author might be in the right by not engaging in the greed. Alternatively, maybe the author should have politely taken something to avoid causing tension. But the author's reasoning is valid\u2014they don't want to be part of the competition. The parents might not be happy because they wanted to see the author participate, but the author is being honest. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
