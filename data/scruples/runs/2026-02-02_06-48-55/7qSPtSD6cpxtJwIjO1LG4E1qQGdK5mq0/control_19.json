They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe parents are in their 70s and creating wills, and the stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon. The step-siblings are marking up the house with color-coded stickers to claim items. The author isn't close to the step-siblings, who they describe as greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything's already taken. The family reacts negatively, and the mom seemed smug about it.\n\nSo, the author's main point is that they don't feel the need to compete for items that are already being claimed. The step-siblings are acting entitlement, and the author is not interested in joining their \"game.\" The parents might be favoring the step-siblings, and the author is distancing themselves from the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is about the right to inherit. Legally, the parents can distribute their assets as they wish. The author isn't taking anything they aren't entitled to; they're just not claiming anything. The step-siblings might be upset because they expected the author to participate in the claiming process, but that's more about the step-siblings' expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe author's decision is a personal choice. They don't owe the family anything, and refusing to engage in the parents' wishes (if that's what's happening) isn't necessarily wrong. The step-siblings' reaction is probably due to their own greed and not the author's fault. The parents might have their own plans, and the author isn't obligated to take anything they don't want.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide what they want from an inheritance, and the family's reaction doesn't make their choice wrong.\n"
