They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills and the extended family, especially the step-siblings, marking up the house with stickers for future inheritance. The author didn't want anything and said so when asked, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around inheritance. In many societies, it's common for families to discuss and plan their wills, and sometimes people might expect certain items to be passed down. However, the author's step-siblings are acting greedily and inconsiderate, as described. The author doesn't have a close relationship with them and finds them unpleasant.\n\nThe author's response of not wanting anything could be seen as a polite way to avoid conflict, especially if they don't have a bond with the step-siblings. However, some might argue that the author could have been more considerate by at least suggesting something, even if they didn't really want it, to avoid hurting feelings. But given the step-siblings' behavior, the author might have felt justified in not participating in what they perceive as a greedy or inconsiderate process.\n\nThe key points are: the author's lack of relationship with the step-siblings, the step-siblings' negative behavior, and the author's honest response. The parents might have been aware of the step-siblings' behavior, as indicated by the mom's smirk. The author's statement could be seen as a refusal to engage in what they see as a petty or greedy family dynamic. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond not wanting to participate in a process they find distasteful. The step-siblings' anger might stem from their own expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong for stating their true feelings. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author is being honest and the step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed than the author's actions.\n"
