They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family, including step-siblings and their kids, are already marking up items they want. The author didn't want anything and was met with negative reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's family is acting greedily, fighting over possessions even before the parents are deceased. The author, who doesn't have close ties with the step-siblings, decides not to participate. They might feel that since everyone else is taking things, there's nothing left, or they don't care about material stuff. \n\nThe parents might have expected the author to claim some items, perhaps considering their own children (including stepchildren) to be part of the inheritance plan. But the author isn't claiming anything, which could be seen as disrespectful or unexpected. However, the author's reasoning is that everything is already taken by others, and they don't really want anything anyway. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the parents had any expectations of the author wanting something, maybe they were disappointed. But the author is being honest about their feelings and the situation. The step-siblings are acting entitled, so the author's refusal might be a reaction to that. Also, the author isn't taking anything, so they aren't contributing to the conflict. They're choosing not to participate, which is their right. The parents might need to adjust their wills, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by stating their position. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their honesty and not wanting to engage in the family's greedy behavior.\n"
