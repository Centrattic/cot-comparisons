They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a will and family members fighting over inheritance.\n\nThe author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family is acting like they're already planning the inheritance, with everyone marking stuff they want. The step-siblings are being really greedy, putting stickers on items. The author isn't close to them and doesn't like their behavior. When asked what they want from the will, the author says they don't want anything. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author was just not shopping for stuff when everything was already claimed.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for saying they don't want anything? Well, people have the right to decline an inheritance if they choose. The author might be distancing themselves from the greedy family members. They might not want to be part of the conflict. Also, the step-siblings' reaction seems to be more about their own greed than the author's right to decline. The parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author is not obligated to take anything. The key points here are personal choice and the right to decline inheritance without guilt. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
