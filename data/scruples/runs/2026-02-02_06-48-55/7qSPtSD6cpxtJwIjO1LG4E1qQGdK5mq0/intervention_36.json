They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a family where the author's stepdad and mom are creating their wills. The family is already marking items with stickers, showing who wants what. The author, when asked by the parents what they want, says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would want something, but the author doesn't. The parents seem to have anticipated this, with the mom smirking.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the social norms and expectations here. Usually, when a parent is talking about their will, family members might expect some inheritance. But the author is choosing not to take anything, possibly because they don't care, or maybe because they don't want to create conflict. The step-siblings are acting greedy, which the author finds distasteful. The author might be trying to avoid getting involved in the family's avarice.\n\nIs the author wrong for saying they don't want anything? Well, people have the right to decline an inheritance. There's no legal obligation to take something. Socially, maybe there's an expectation, but it's not a rule. The author isn't taking from others; they're just passing up their own share. The parents might be disappointed, but they can adjust their wills accordingly. The step-siblings' reaction shows their own greed, so the author's response might be a way to distance themselves from that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they believe that not taking anything is socially inappropriate. However, the author isn't violating any laws or explicit agreements. The parents can still decide how to distribute their estate. The key point is that the author isn't taking anything, which is their choice. The wrong here would depend on if there was an expectation or agreement, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference.\n"
