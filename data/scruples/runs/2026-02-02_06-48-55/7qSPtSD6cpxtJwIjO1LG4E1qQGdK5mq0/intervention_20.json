They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a will and how the author responded when asked what they want from their parents' estate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see the other side too.\n\nFirst, the parents are creating their wills, and the stepdad is being overly dramatic about it. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting stickers on everything they want. The author doesn't get along with them and finds them unpleasant. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything is already claimed. The family reacts badly, and the author is being questioned if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that since the step-siblings have already marked everything, there's nothing left. But maybe the author could have expressed interest in something, even if it's not the stuff others are taking. Or maybe the parents wanted to know what the author specifically wants, not just what's left. \n\nBut then, the author's relationship with the step-siblings is strained. They describe them as \"callow, vapid\" and self-absorbed. The author might not want to engage with them over material things. Also, the parents might not have considered that the author isn't interested in the physical items since they're already taken. \n\nIs it wrong to not want anything? Maybe not. People have different values. The author might prefer sentimental items or not care for material stuff. The problem is the family's reaction, but the author isn't obligated to want something just because others are taking it. The parents could have handled the will process better, but the author's response seems honest. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It depends on whether the parents expected the author to have specific desires or if the author's honesty is acceptable.\n"
