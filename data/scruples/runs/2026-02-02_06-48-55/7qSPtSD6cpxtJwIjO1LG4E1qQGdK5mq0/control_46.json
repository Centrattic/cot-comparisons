They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family, including step-siblings, are already marking items they want. The author didn't want anything and the family was upset about that.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They don't get along with the step-siblings, who are acting greedy and self-centered. The author feels that the step-siblings are being awful, so maybe they don't want to participate in that. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything's already taken, which upsets the others.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Do you have an obligation to want something from your parents' will? I don't think so. People have different relationships with their parents and their stuff. The author might not value material possessions or might not want to get involved in the family's conflict. Also, the step-siblings are acting in a way that's problematic, so the author's decision not to engage could be seen as a reasonable choice.\n\nThe parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author's response was honest. The fact that the step-siblings were already taking things with stickers might mean there's a lot of conflict, and the author is avoiding that. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're not obligated to want stuff just because others do. They might be considered disrespectful if they were dismissive, but they just said they didn't want anything. The parents' reaction was stunned silence, but that's their issue, not the author's. The answer should be B (No).\n"
