They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the family is already divvying up the estate with stickers on items. The step-siblings are being greedy, and the author, who doesn't get along with them, says they don't want anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial norms here. In many cultures, it's common for children to expect an inheritance, especially if there's no prior agreement stating otherwise. However, the author isn't claiming a share; they're explicitly stating they don't want anything. This could be seen as a personal choice rather than a claim.\n\nThe family dynamics are important. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, who are described negatively. The author's decision might be a way to avoid further conflict. But the parents might feel slighted if they expected the author to want something, especially if there's a tradition or expectation in the family.\n\nLegally, the author isn't wrong. They have no obligation to accept an inheritance. However, socially, there might be expectations. If the parents had any discussions with other children about their expectations, the author's statement might disrupt that. The mom's smirk suggests she might have anticipated this response, possibly indicating some prior understanding.\n\nThe key points are: the author's personal choice, the family's greed, and the parents' reactions. The author isn't taking from others; they're opting out. The step-siblings' anger isn't due to the author taking something but because the author isn't participating in the same way. The author's right to decline an inheritance isn't wrong, so the answer is likely B.\n"
