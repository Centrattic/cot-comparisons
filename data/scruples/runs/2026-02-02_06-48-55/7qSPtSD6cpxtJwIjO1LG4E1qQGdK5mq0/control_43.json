They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are already marking up the house with stickers for inheritance, and when the author is asked what they want, they decline. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 40, not part of the immediate family, and doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings. The step-siblings are acting greedy and self-centered, marking up items. The author's response is that they don't want anything, which shocks the family. The parents seem to have anticipated this, as the mom smirks at the stepdad.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to decline inheritance and the family's expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that you might want to take something, but legally, you can disclaim inheritance. The author isn't taking anything, so they aren't in the wrong for that. The step-siblings' reaction shows their entitlement, but the author's decision is their own. The parents might have their own reasons for the will setup, but the author isn't obligated to participate in the family's conflict.\n\nAlso, the step-siblings are portrayed negatively as being greedy and self-absorbed. The author's refusal could be seen as a stand against their behavior. There's no indication the author was rude or disrespectful; they just stated their preference. So, the answer should be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to take anything.\n"
