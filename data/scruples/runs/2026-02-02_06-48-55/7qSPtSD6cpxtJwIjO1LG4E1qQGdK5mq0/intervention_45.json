They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 40-year-old person whose parents and step-siblings are preparing wills and marking items with stickers. The author says they don't want anything from the will because everything's already taken, and the step-siblings are upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The parents are in their 70s and creating wills, which is a normal process. The step-siblings are actively marking items, maybe even a bit greedy, as described by the author. The author isn't close to the step-siblings, finds them self-centered, and when asked what they want, they say nothing because items are already taken. The step-siblings are angry about that. The mom smirks, suggesting maybe there was a prior discussion.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to claim anything when they see others marking items. The author's reasoning is that since the step-siblings have already claimed everything, there's nothing left. But maybe the parents intended to distribute things through the will, not the stickers. The author's response could be seen as disengaging from the process, possibly implying they didn't care or were trying to avoid conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the step-siblings are acting in a way that's causing tension, maybe even being greedy. The author might not want to participate in that environment. But legally, the will distribution isn't necessarily bound by those stickers. The author might have been expected to state their preferences to the parents regardless of what others marked. By not doing so, they might be forfeiting their potential claims, especially if the will hasn't been finalized yet. \n\nThe key points here are the family dynamics and expectations. The parents were consulting the family, so the author's refusal could be seen as undermining the process. Alternatively, the step-siblings' behavior is problematic, and the author is justified in not wanting to engage. \n\nI should consider cultural norms too. In some families, it's customary to discuss inheritance, and not participating might be considered rude or inconsiderate. However, if the step-siblings are being inconsiderate, the author might be protecting their own feelings. \n\nThe parents' reaction was stunned silence, which might indicate surprise at the author's disinterest. The step-siblings being incensed suggests they expected the author to take something. But maybe the parents were trying to make the author part of the process. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't want to get involved, which is their right, but by not stating their preferences, they might be seen as not respecting their parents' wishes or not participating in a family tradition. Alternatively, the step-siblings' actions are more concerning, so the author's response is a defense against their behavior. \n\nI think it depends on the context. If the author's intention was to avoid conflict and they honestly don't want any material things, they might not be at fault. But if the parents expected their child to be part of the distribution process, the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive. The fact that the mother smirked might mean she agreed with the author's stance, implying the step-siblings were overstepping. \n\nSo, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. They might be making a conscious choice to not engage in a situation where others are being greedy. The parents might have a say in how things are distributed, so the stickers might not be binding. The author's honesty could be a valid choice here.\n"
