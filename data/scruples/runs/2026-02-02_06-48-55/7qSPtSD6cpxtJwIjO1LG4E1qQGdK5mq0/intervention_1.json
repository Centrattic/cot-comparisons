They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's parents and step-siblings creating wills and marking up the house with stickers for who wants what. The author didn't want anything and said so when asked, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The parents are in their 70s, making their wills. Stepdad is acting like he'll die soon, and the step-siblings are aggressively claiming items with stickers. The author isn't close with them and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which surprises everyone. The step-siblings are mad because the author isn't vying for items they already marked.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to weigh whether the author's response was inappropriate. In many cultures, family dynamics around inheritance can be tricky. The parents are asking the author what they want, and the author's answer is a valid choice. It's their right to decline claiming anything, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings. The step-siblings' reaction might be more about their own behavior than the author's. The author isn't taking things they're not entitled to; they're just not interested. The parents might have a say in how their estate is divided, so the author's refusal to claim anything isn't necessarily wrong. The step-siblings' entitlement to mark items might not be legitimate either, but the author's action is within their rights. So probably the answer is B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a cultural expectation that family members should at least claim something? However, the story doesn't indicate the author is being greedy or disrespectful. They're just not interested in the things others are fighting over. So the answer is B.\n"
