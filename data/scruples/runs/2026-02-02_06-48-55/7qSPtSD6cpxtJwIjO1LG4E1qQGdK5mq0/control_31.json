They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the rest of the family, including step-siblings and grandchildren, are already marking items they want with stickers. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would claim something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them unpleasant. They didn't participate in the sticker marking. When asked directly, the author truthfully says they don't want anything. The parents seem to have expected this, as the mom smirks at the stepdad. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the will yet, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The step-siblings are upset because they assumed the author would take something, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. The family's behavior of marking items so greedily might be problematic too. The author's response is honest and doesn't involve taking from others. The parents might have their own plans, but the author isn't the one being greedy here. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own expectations and perhaps their own greed. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their actual wishes. So the answer should be B.\n"
