They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's parents and step-siblings who are actively marking items in their home with stickers, essentially claiming them while the parents are still alive. The author didn't participate in this and when asked what they want, said nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and family dynamics. In some cultures, it's common to discuss inheritance while parents are alive, but this seems extreme, with items being marked by stickers. The step-siblings are being described as greedy and self-centered. The author doesn't get along with them and finds their behavior awful. The parents are in their 70s and have been creating their wills, but the process seems to be managed by the step-siblings in a way that's causing tension.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to decline inheritance and the context of the family's actions. Legally, a person can choose to renounce an inheritance if they don't want it, but the question is more about social and emotional wrongness rather than legal. The author's response was to say they don't want anything, which might have upset the step-siblings because they were used to people claiming items. The parents' reaction included a smirk from the mom, suggesting maybe she was expecting this. The step-siblings' anger stems from the fact that they had already staked their claims, and the author's refusal disrupted their expectations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the expectations within the family. If the parents were okay with their children claiming items in advance, but the author didn't want to participate, it's not the author's fault. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, being greedy and taking things for granted. The author's honesty about not wanting anything is a personal choice, which they have the right to make. There's no obligation to accept inheritance, especially in a situation where others are acting inconsiderately. The parents might have their own say in how their estate is distributed, so the author's statement might just be their preference, not a wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
