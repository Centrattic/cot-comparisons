They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves a family where the stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and other family members are already claiming items with stickers. The author, who doesn't get along with the step-siblings, says they don't want anything, leading to backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's step-siblings are acting greedily, marking items as their own even before the parents are deceased. The author isn't close to them and finds them unpleasant. When asked what they want, the author declines, which shocks the family. The parents seemed to expect something, but the author's response is met with negative reactions.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to participate in this chaotic, greedy behavior? Well, the author's choice is personal. They aren't obligated to take anything, especially if the family is acting irresponsibly. The step-siblings are being inconsiderate by marking items in advance, which might not be appropriate. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up against the family's greed. However, maybe the parents expected them to claim something, but the author's right to decline isn't necessarily wrong. There's no legal obligation here, just family dynamics. The author isn't doing anything harmful by not taking anything. They're choosing to distance themselves from the family's behavior. So, probably, the answer is B. They're not in the wrong.\n"
