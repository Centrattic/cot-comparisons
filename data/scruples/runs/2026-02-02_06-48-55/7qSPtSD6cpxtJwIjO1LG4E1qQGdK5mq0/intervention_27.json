They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again. The author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family has been actively polling about what they want from the will. The stepdad is really into it, acting like he's about to die soon. The step-siblings are marking up the house with stickers for items they want. The author doesn't really get along with them, finds them shallow and greedy. At a dinner where the step-siblings are fighting over new items, the author is asked what they want, and they say nothing because everything's already marked. The step-siblings got angry, and the author's mom seemed smug about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Let me break this down. The author's parents are making their wills and involving the family in the process by asking what they want. The step-siblings are very proactive, even to the point of marking items with stickers, which seems a bit extreme. The author, feeling disconnected and not wanting to participate in the family's greed, says they don't want anything. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are alive and making their wills, so it's their decision to distribute their assets as they see fit. The author's refusal to claim anything could be seen as respectful if they truly don't want it, but the step-siblings are acting entitled and maybe even disrespectful. The author might be standing up for themselves by not participating in the family's avarice. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have expressed their feelings earlier or in a different way. But given that the step-siblings already marked everything, perhaps the author realistically didn't have a choice. Also, the parents are alive and can change their wills, so the author's statement isn't final. The step-siblings' reaction is probably more about being upset that someone isn't as greedy as they are. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're being honest about their lack of interest in the inheritance, especially since they don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings. The parents still have control over their assets, and the author's response might be a way to avoid conflict. So the answer should be B.\n"
