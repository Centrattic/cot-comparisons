They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about family dynamics and inheritance. The user (the author) is 40 years old and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating their wills. The family is acting like they're already planning the inheritance, with step-siblings and even grandchildren marking items with stickers as if they're claiming them. The author doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, seeing them as selfish. When asked what they want from the will, the author says they don't want anything, which shocks the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial expectations around inheritance. In many families, especially in Western cultures, it's common to expect some inheritance from parents, especially when they're older. However, the author explicitly states they don't want anything, which might be seen as unexpected or even hurtful. \n\nBut why would that be the case? The family is acting greedy, and the author might feel like there's nothing left for them anyway because everything is already claimed. The step-siblings are being described as materialistic and selfish, so maybe the author is reacting to that. The parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author's decision could be a form of protest against the family's behavior.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to participate in what seems like a chaotic and greedy family dynamic? Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to take anything. Emotionally or socially, maybe they are if the parents felt disrespected. But the parents did seem to have a prior conversation where the mom smirked, implying maybe she agreed with the author's stance. \n\nThe key points are the family's behavior vs. the author's genuine feelings. The author might not be in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings and the situation. The family's actions are problematic, so the author's response is a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
