They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they did something wrong by saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's stepdad and mom are in their 70s and creating wills. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon, and the step-siblings are marking up the house with stickers to claim items. They're all fighting over stuff, even the grandkids. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings and thinks they're self-absorbed. At a family dinner, when asked what they want, the author says they don't want anything because everything seems already taken.\n\nThe step-siblings were upset because the author didn't join the \"shopping\" like everyone else. The parents had prior conversation, maybe the mom had warned the stepdad about the author's response. \n\nNow, the question is AITA. The key points here are the author's relationship with the step-siblings, their genuine feelings about the family's behavior, and the context of the will distribution. The author might not feel entitled to claim items if they don't have a close relationship with the parents or step-siblings. On the other hand, maybe the family expects everyone to participate in the process, even if they don't take anything.\n\nBut legally, the author is not in the wrong. They can choose to decline inheritance if they want. However, socially, maybe the family expects them to at least express interest or make a claim. But given that the step-siblings were so greedy and the author didn't want to engage in that, it's more about their personal choice. The author's answer was honest, and the step-siblings' reaction seems to be about their own greed and expectations rather than the author's wrongness. \n\nThe parents might not be thrilled if their child isn't interested, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
