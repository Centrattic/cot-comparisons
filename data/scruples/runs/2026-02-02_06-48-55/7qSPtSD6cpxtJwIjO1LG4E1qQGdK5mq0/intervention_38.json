They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for stating they want nothing from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the step-siblings are already divvying up belongings with stickers. The author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything, leading to backlash from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they don't get along with the step-siblings and finds them \"callow, vapid, empty shells.\" This suggests a strained relationship. The step-siblings are acting greedily, marking up items they want. The parents are involved in creating their wills and are polling the family, which might indicate they want to distribute assets fairly or according to their wishes.\n\nThe key point is the author's refusal to claim anything. In some cultures or families, expecting an inheritance might be the norm, but if the author has a poor relationship and sees the others as greedy, their stance could be justified. However, there's a social expectation in many cases to express interest in an inheritance, even if it's minimal. By not wanting anything, the author might be seen as cutting ties or being cold-hearted, which could hurt the parents' feelings.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is important. They don't want to participate in the family's greed, and they might truly not need anything. The step-siblings were already taking items, so maybe the author is making a statement against the family's materialism. The parents' reaction includes their mom smirking, which suggests there's some prior discussion or agreement. However, the step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to take something.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the author is being honest about not wanting anything and the parents are okay with it, then they're not in the wrong. But if the refusal is seen as a rejection or disrespect to the parents, then maybe they are. However, the story shows the author's parents might not be upset, given the mom's smirk. The main conflict is with the step-siblings, not the parents. So, the author's answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're being truthful and the parents aren't opposed.\n"
