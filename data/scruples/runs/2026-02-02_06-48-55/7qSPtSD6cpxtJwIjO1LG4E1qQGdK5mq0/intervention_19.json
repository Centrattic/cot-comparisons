They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's parents creating their wills and the step-siblings being really pushy about what they want from the estate. The author says they don't want anything, which surprises everyone else. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The parents are in their 70s and setting up wills. The step-siblings are marking items in the house with stickers, almost like claiming them. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and sees them as selfish. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which upsets the step-siblings. The parents are okay with it, maybe even relieved.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting anything. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision might be seen as respecting their parents' property. If the step-siblings are acting greedy and the author doesn't want to contribute to that, maybe it's justified. On the other hand, some might argue that not expressing any interest could be hurtful, especially if the parents expected them to want something. But the parents didn't force the author to take anything; they just asked. The author's choice to decline might be a personal one, not wanting to get involved in the family's material squabbles.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some families, it's expected to claim something, but if the author isn't close and the others are being inappropriate, maybe it's not the author's fault. The step-siblings are acting like it's already their stuff, so the author's refusal could be a way to avoid conflict. The parents' reaction (mom smirking) suggests they agree, so the author isn't necessarily wrong here.\n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong to not want to take anything from your parents' estate? Maybe if there's an expectation, but the author's reasoning is based on the step-siblings' behavior and their own disinterest. The key is that the parents were the ones creating the wills and the author isn't fighting the claims others are making. The author's action is personal and doesn't harm anyone else, just not participating in the material grab. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not taking part in the family's greed and are honest about their feelings. The step-siblings are the ones acting immaturely, not the author. The parents might have their own plans for the will, so the author isn't overstepping by stating their position.\n"
