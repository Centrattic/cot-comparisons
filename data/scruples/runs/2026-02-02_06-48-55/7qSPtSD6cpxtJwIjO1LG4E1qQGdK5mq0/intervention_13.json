They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the author's stepdad and mom are making their wills, and the family is already fighting over items with color-coded stickers. The author didn't want anything and got a bad reaction from the step-siblings.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they don't get along with the step-siblings, who they see as greedy and bad people. They didn't want to participate in the frenzy over belongings. The parents asked, and the author said nothing because they didn't want anything. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author was taking a pass on the inheritance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is stating their preference. They have the right to decide what they want. The family dynamics here are tense, and the step-siblings are acting entitled. The author isn't taking anything, so they aren't interfering. Their response was honest. The step-siblings' reaction might stem from their own greed rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nBut maybe the author should have considered the parents' feelings? If the parents had expected them to take something, but the author didn't want it, maybe that could be an issue. However, the parents seem to have been involved in the process, and the author's response was direct. The step-siblings being upset is probably because they wanted the author to take nothing so they could take more themselves. The author's stance is about personal choice and not wanting to engage in the conflict.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're not taking anything, just stating their preference. The step-siblings' behavior is more problematic. So answer B.\n"
