They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves a family where the stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and everyone else is already fighting over stuff with stickers and dibs.\n\nThe author, who is 40, isn't close to the step-siblings. They find the siblings to be shallow and greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing. The step-siblings got upset, thinking the author wasn't trying to claim things because they were already taken. The mom seemed smug, implying maybe there was a prior discussion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family seems to be in a chaotic, materialistic state, which could be stressful for the parents. The author's decision not to take anything might be seen as aloof or dismissive, especially if the parents expected them to participate in the process. However, the author isn't close to the step-siblings and might not want to engage in the family's greed. \n\nIs it wrong to not want anything? Well, it's their choice. People can decide not to take inheritance for various reasons. But maybe the parents felt slighted or the step-siblings saw it as not trying hard enough. But the author isn't responsible for the family's greed. They're just stating their own desires. The parents asked, so the author answered truthfully. The step-siblings' reaction is their problem, not the author's. \n\nThe user might think the author should have tried to take something, but the author isn't obligated to participate in their family's squabbles. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
