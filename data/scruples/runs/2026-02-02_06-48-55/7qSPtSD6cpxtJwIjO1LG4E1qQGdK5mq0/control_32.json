They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the stepdad and mom are making their wills, and the family is already marking items they want. The author, who isn't close to the step-siblings, says they don't want anything when asked. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong here. The main points to consider are the family dynamics and the author's right to decline. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting stickers on items, even for the grandkids. The author isn't part of that group and doesn't want anything. The parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author is being honest.\n\nIs it wrong to not want anything? Probably not. People can choose not to inherit if they don't want to. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own expectations being unmet rather than the author being in the wrong. The author isn't taking something they shouldn't; they're just stating their preference. The parents might be okay with that, especially if there's a prior conversation mentioned. The step-siblings' anger is their issue, not the author's.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decline and aren't obligated to participate in the family's chaotic inheritance planning. The problem lies with the step-siblings' behavior, not the author's response.\n"
