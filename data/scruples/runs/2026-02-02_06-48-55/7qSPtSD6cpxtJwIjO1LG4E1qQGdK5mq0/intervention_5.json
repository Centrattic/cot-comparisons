They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves a stepdad and mom creating their wills, with the family already putting stickers on items they want. The author, who doesn't get along much with the step-siblings, says they don't want anything. The step-siblings get upset because everything seems taken already.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the cultural and familial norms here. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, people are free to make their own choices about inheritance. The author isn't taking something that was promised to them; they're just stating they don't want anything. The step-siblings are acting greedily, which the author points out, but the parents might still expect their kids to have some claim.\n\nThe parents asked the author directly what they wanted. The author responded honestly but the family's reaction was negative. Maybe the parents had an expectation that the author would want something, perhaps even assuming they should get a share. However, the author's decision not to take anything could be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful, depending on the family's dynamics.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they don't hang out with the step-siblings and finds them problematic. The step-siblings are acting avariciously, which the author criticizes. The author's refusal might be a way of standing up against the family's greedy behavior. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the conflict or the rush to grab items.\n\nHowever, there's a possible unspoken expectation in families that you should have a claim to your parents' estate. By not wanting anything, the author might be seen as not honoring their family or their parents' wishes. On the other hand, the parents are the ones creating the wills, so the author's choice is ultimately their own.\n\nThe key points are: the author is making their own choice, not taking from others. The step-siblings are the ones being greedy, but the author's refusal to participate might be seen as a way to avoid conflict or to not engage in what they view as a greedy family affair. The parents' surprise might stem from unmet expectations, but the author isn't violating any rules by not wanting anything. They have the right to choose not to take anything, even if it disappoints others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their own feelings and the family's behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
