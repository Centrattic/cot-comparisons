They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the person's stepdad and mom in their 70s creating wills. The family is already marking up stuff with stickers, dividing up possessions even before the parents are gone. The step-siblings and even the kids are putting their claims on various items. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, who they think are greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which upsets the step-siblings because they thought everything was already claimed.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not wanting anything? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents were actively polling the family about what they want. The step-siblings are acting greedy, but maybe the author is just being honest. They don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings and didn't want to take anything because everything was already taken. The parents seemed to expect the author to claim something, but the author didn't want to get involved in the chaos.\n\nIs there an expectation here? If the parents wanted to distribute their belongings and the author isn't interested, maybe they're not at fault. The step-siblings were the ones marking things, maybe expecting others to take what's left. The author isn't claiming anything because they don't value material stuff or have a good relationship with the family. But maybe the parents felt slighted because the author didn't say anything. However, the author's response was honest. The step-siblings were upset because they thought everything was taken, but the author didn't go along with that.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the author should have made a claim just to be polite, even if they didn't want anything. But the author's reasoning is that they don't want to participate in the family's greedy behavior. If the parents wanted to give things to the family, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to take anything. The author's answer might have been uncomfortable for the family but not necessarily wrong. So, maybe the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
