They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story (AITA) is wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the person's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family (step-siblings and their kids) marking items they want. The AITA person is not close to the step-siblings, finds them self-centered, and when asked what they want, says nothing. The step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The AITA person is in their 40s, so they're adults. The parents are in their 70s, so it's about estate planning. The step-siblings and their kids are acting greedily, marking up the house with stickers. The AITA person isn't part of that family group, doesn't get along with them, and when asked what they want, they decline. The parents seem to have expected some reaction, but the AITA person is honest about not wanting anything.\n\nIs the AITA wrong? Well, they're not taking anything. They didn't lie or take something they weren't supposed to. They might be seen as not showing interest, but they have a valid reason\u2014discomfort with the family's behavior. The step-siblings might feel entitled, but the AITA person isn't entitled to what others have marked. The parents might feel the AITA person isn't considering their feelings, but the AITA person is being honest. \n\nSo, no, the AITA is not in the wrong. They're being truthful and not participating in the family's conflict. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and expectations, not the AITA's wrongdoing. The answer should be B.\n"
