They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics around wills and inheritance.\n\nSo, the author is 40 years old, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family is already dividing up the parents' belongings with color-coded stickers, which seems pretty extreme. The step-siblings are fighting over stuff, and even the grandchildren are involved. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, finds them greedy and shallow. At a family dinner, when asked what they want from the parents' estate, the author says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would be claiming items, but since everything's already marked, the author doesn't want anything. The parents reacted with stunned silence and the mom seemed smug.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to decide A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, who they view as greedy. The family is acting as if the parents are already dead, which is probably causing tension. The author's refusal to claim anything might be a way of not engaging in the conflict or showing disinterest in the material stuff. The parents might have expected the author to want something, but the author's response could be a reaction to the chaotic, greedy environment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have at least said they wanted something, even if it was symbolic. The parents might feel hurt that the author isn't interested in their possessions. But the author's reasoning is that everything is already taken, and they don't want to participate in the fighting. The parents might be okay with that, especially if the mom was smirking, implying she agreed with the author's stance.\n\nLooking at the step-siblings' reaction: they were incensed because they thought the author would be another person to fight over things. The author's refusal might have disrupted their plans, which is why they're upset. The author isn't taking part in the greed, which could be seen as a positive, but the parents might feel disrespected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intent and context. The author's intent was to not engage in the materialistic race, which might be a moral stance. The parents might not be wrong in expecting some interest, but the author's reasons are valid given the context. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, so the author's refusal could be a justified decision.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're choosing not to participate in a negative family dynamic. They're honest about not wanting anything, which is their right. The step-siblings' greed is the real issue here, not the author's refusal.\n"
