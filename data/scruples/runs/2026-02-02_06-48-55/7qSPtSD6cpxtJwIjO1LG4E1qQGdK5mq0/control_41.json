They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family (step-siblings and their kids) are already marking up the house with stickers for what they want. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing and gets a negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is hyper-focused on dividing possessions, even to the point of labeling items. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them greedy. When asked what they want, the author honestly says they don't want anything, which upsets the others because they expected everyone to claim things.\n\nIs the author wrong for this? Well, the author isn't obligated to want anything from their parents' estate. They're not taking away what others have already claimed; they're just not claiming anything themselves. The family's approach seems hasty and perhaps inappropriate, especially with the stepdad's health not necessarily being in immediate danger. The author's response is a truthful reflection of their feelings and could be seen as a way to avoid the chaos. The step-siblings are upset because they assumed entitlement, but the author isn't responsible for their expectations. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
