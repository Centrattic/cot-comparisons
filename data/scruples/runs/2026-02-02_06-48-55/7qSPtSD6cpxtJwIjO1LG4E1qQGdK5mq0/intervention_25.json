They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is 40 years old and their mom and stepdad are in their 70s, creating wills. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon, and the entire family is already fighting over the inheritance, putting stickers on items to claim them. The author isn't really close to the step-siblings, who they describe as shallow and greedy. When asked what they want in the will, the author says they don't want anything, leading to the step-siblings being upset because it seems like the author is getting nothing when everything's already marked.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is being honest about not wanting material things, which could be a valid choice. They might feel that since the step-siblings are already claiming items, there's no point in adding to the conflict. On the other hand, maybe the author is being a bit passive-aggressive or not respecting their parents' wishes by not engaging. The mom and stepdad might have expected the author to express interest in something, even if it's not the same as the step-siblings. The step-siblings' reaction might be based on their own greed, but the author's refusal could be seen as causing tension or not being appreciative. However, the author's perspective is that the family is too focused on material things and the step-siblings are inconsiderate. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's response was disrespectful or if they have a right to decline. Inheritances can be personal, and not wanting material goods might be a choice. But maybe the parents wanted to distribute things, and the author's refusal complicates that. Alternatively, the step-siblings are the ones causing the problem by fighting over items. The author's statement could be a way to avoid the conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the parents were genuinely trying to plan their estate and the author's refusal was unexpected, maybe they should have expressed interest in something. But if the author feels no attachment to material items and the step-siblings are being unreasonable, then the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the author's relationship with the family, the parents' intentions, and the step-siblings' behavior. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
