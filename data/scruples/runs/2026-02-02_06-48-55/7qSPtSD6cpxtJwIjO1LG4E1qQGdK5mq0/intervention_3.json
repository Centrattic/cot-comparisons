They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills. The family is acting like they're already dividing the inheritance, with color-coded stickers on items. The step-siblings and even the kids are marking things they want. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, who they describe as greedy and shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which upsets the family, especially the step-siblings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author's decision not to claim anything might be seen as not participating in the family's way of handling things. However, the author's perspective is that the family is acting inconsiderate, and they prefer not to engage in the frenzy. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't taking things that are already marked, so they aren't being greedy. The step-siblings' reaction might stem from surprise or feeling that the author isn't playing along with their game. But is the author wrong for not wanting anything? It depends on the context. If the author had a prior expectation or if the family dynamics suggest they should be more active, maybe. But given the description, the author's stance seems reasonable. They aren't taking anything, just choosing not to claim stuff when others are being greedy. \n\nThe step-siblings' anger could be because they expected the author to take something, but the author's choice to not participate might be a form of passive resistance to their behavior. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to engage in the family's competitive inheritance process. So, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
