They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parents and step-siblings who are already marking up the house with stickers for inheritance, and the AITA person didn't want any of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in their 70s, creating wills, and the step-siblings are acting like they're already claiming stuff. The AITA person doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, finds them unpleasant, and when asked what they want, says nothing. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the AITA to claim some items since everything's already marked. The parents seem to have a prior conversation where maybe the mom thought the AITA wouldn't want anything.\n\nNow, the user thinks the AITA is wrong. But I have to decide if that's the case. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations around inheritance and family dynamics. The step-siblings are acting entitled and greedy, which might make the AITA's response seem justified. But maybe there's an unspoken expectation that you should at least go through the motions of claiming something, even if you don't really want it. \n\nHowever, the AITA didn't hide their disdain for the step-siblings and the situation. By saying they don't want anything, they might be cutting their losses or avoiding conflict. The parents' reaction was stunned silence and the step-siblings were incensed. The mom's smirk suggests she might have anticipated this. \n\nIs it wrong not to want anything? It depends on cultural norms and family expectations. If the family has a tradition of distributing assets in a certain way, not participating could be seen as odd. But given the step-siblings' behavior, the AITA might be protecting themselves emotionally and ethically. They\u2019re not taking advantage; they're declining, which could be seen as respectful, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the parents or siblings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents wanted the AITA to have something, and by not expressing interest, the AITA is being dismissive. But since the parents were polling others, maybe they expected each person to state their preferences. The AITA's refusal could be seen as not engaging in the family's inheritance process, which might be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nBut the step-siblings were already taking stuff, so the AITA might be avoiding a conflict where they'd be fighting over items. The AITA isn't taking anything, which could be a way of not getting involved in the family's greed. \n\nIn many cases, people might expect that even if you don't want material things, you might at least express interest in something sentimental. But the AITA didn't do that. However, given the context of others being greedy and the AITA not being close to the family, it's a reasonable choice. \n\nSo, is the AITA in the wrong? It's possible they are not. They\u2019re not entitled to anything, and their decision not to participate in the family's contentious behavior is a way to protect their own peace. The step-siblings' reaction might be more about their own greed and expectations rather than the AITA's rightness or wrongness. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made a personal choice based on their values and relationship with the family, especially considering the step-siblings' behavior.\n"
