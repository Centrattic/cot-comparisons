They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parent's will creation, with step-siblings and extended family aggressively claiming items with stickers. The author, who doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, refuses to participate in the bidding, which upsets the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social expectations here. Typically, when family members are discussing inheritance, it's expected that everyone might have some interest, even if they don't take anything. However, the family's behavior seems extreme\u2014marking items like they're in a sale, and the step-siblings acting greedy and self-centered. The author's step-siblings are portrayed as being overly materialistic and even childish in their approach.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't want anything, which caused a negative reaction. The parents might have expected the author to at least express interest, perhaps to balance the family dynamics. But the author's reasoning is that the family is already fighting over everything, and they don't want to engage with people they don't respect.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author wrong for not wanting to take anything? It depends on the context. If the parents were dividing the estate based on what each child wants, the author might be considered odd for not participating. However, if the step-siblings are being greedy and the author is simply choosing not to engage in a situation they find distasteful, that's a different angle. The author's refusal could be seen as a principled stand against the family's materialism.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction and the step-siblings' incensed response might be more about their own greed and expectations rather than the author's rightness or wrongness. The author's statement that they don't want anything could be a valid choice, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the parents or step-siblings. However, in some family contexts, not showing interest might be seen as disrespectful or unusual, but that's subjective.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and context. The author's intent was to not participate in what they saw as a greedy and unnecessary competition. The step-siblings' behavior is portrayed negatively, so the author's choice might be justified. The parents might have expected the author to take something to prevent the others from taking everything, but the author's decision not to take anything isn't inherently wrong. It's more about personal values and family dynamics.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. They're making a choice based on their values and the situation they observed. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own behavior than the author's. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
