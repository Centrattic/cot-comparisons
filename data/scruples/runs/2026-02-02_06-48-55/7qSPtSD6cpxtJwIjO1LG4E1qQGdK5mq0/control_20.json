They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe user is 40 and their stepdad and mom, both in their 70s, are making their wills. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon, and the rest of the family is already marking up stuff with stickers to claim ownership. The step-siblings are fighting over items like the moose head, tools, and even the grandkids want the fire tablets and TVs. The user doesn't get along with the step-siblings and thinks they're selfish. When asked what they want from their parents' estate, the user says they don't want anything. The family reacts negatively, especially the step-siblings, and the mom seems to know something the user didn't.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong for not wanting anything. Let's break it down. The parents are creating their wills now, which means the user might be an heir. The family is already fighting over inheritance, which might indicate that they expect to get things. The user says they don't want anything, which could be seen as unexpected. But maybe the user is just being honest or doesn't want to be part of the squabbles.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily disrespectful. They're not taking what isn't theirs. They're just not claiming anything. The step-siblings are acting greedy, so maybe the user is taking a stand. However, the parents might have expected the user to want something, but the user isn't obligated to take anything. It's their choice. The user might be in the right because they're not interfering, just stating their preference. The step-siblings are the ones fighting over stuff, so the user's response is a valid one. The answer might be B (No), the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
