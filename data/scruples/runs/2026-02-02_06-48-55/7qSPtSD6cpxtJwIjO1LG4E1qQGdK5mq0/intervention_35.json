They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a will and how the family is handling the distribution of the parents' belongings. The author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, making wills. The whole family is acting like they're already inheriting stuff, with color-coded stickers on items. The step-siblings are fighting over things, even the grandkids. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, finds them self-centered, and when asked what they want from the will, the author says they don't want anything. The family is shocked and upset because everything seems already claimed.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they might be, but I need to assess based on the details.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they don't want anything, maybe because they don't care about material things, or they're not close to the step-siblings and don't want to get involved in the conflict. They might feel that the step-siblings are greedy, so not wanting to participate is a way to avoid the mess. But why would that be wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents expected the author to express some interest, especially if there's a family tradition or if the author has a closer relationship with the parents. If the parents were trying to make everyone feel included and the author's refusal was seen as disrespectful or dismissive, that could be a problem. Also, if the author had previously indicated they wanted something, but in this case, they just said nothing.\n\nBut according to the story, the author didn't hang out with step-siblings much, didn't warm up to them, and saw them as vapid. The author might genuinely not want to engage in the fight over material goods. The parents might have been trying to get everyone's input, but the author's response was unexpected. The step-siblings were incensed because they thought the author should be claiming stuff, but maybe they're just projecting their own greed.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? It's their choice. They have a right to decline. Maybe the parents are okay with it, especially if they saw the step-siblings as problematic. The mom's smirk suggests she might agree with the author. So, the author's answer was honest and reflected their feelings, even if it upset others. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong (B). The wrong would be the step-siblings being greedy, but the author isn't obligated to participate in that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
