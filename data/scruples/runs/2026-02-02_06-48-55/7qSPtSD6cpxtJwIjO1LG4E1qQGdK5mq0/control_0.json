They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that their stepdad and mom are making wills, and the family is already marking up stuff with stickers. The step-siblings are being really greedy, taking everything they can think of. The author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything, which shocks everyone else.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author was wrong to say that. The key points here are the family's behavior versus the author's response. The step-siblings are acting like they're entitled to all the stuff, even putting stickers on items. The author doesn't get along well with them and finds them self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which the step-siblings are upset about because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nFirst, the author isn't claiming anything, which is their right. There's no legal obligation to take anything from a will. The parents are creating the wills, so they can decide how to distribute their assets. The author's statement might have been a choice to not participate in the family's greed. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to take something, but the author didn't. \n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. The mom smirked at the stepdad, suggesting maybe there was a prior understanding. The author's response could be a way of not getting involved in the family's squabbles. There's no indication the author is being greedy or selfish; they're just not interested in the material things. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're not obligated to take anything, and their response might be a refusal to engage in the family's materialism. The step-siblings' reaction seems more about their own entitlement rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
