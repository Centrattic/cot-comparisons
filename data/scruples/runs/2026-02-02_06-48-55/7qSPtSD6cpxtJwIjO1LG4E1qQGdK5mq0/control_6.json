They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parents making their wills, and the family is already marking items with stickers as if they're pre-selecting them. The author's step-siblings are acting greedy and self-centered, which the author calls \"callow, vapid empty shells.\" The author didn't want to participate in the scramble, so when asked, they declined. Their parents reacted with stunned silence, and the step-siblings were upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The parents are in their 70s and creating wills, which is a normal process. They were polling the family, which might be a way to get input. The step-siblings are marking items, even museum-quality artifacts, which seems extreme and perhaps disrespectful. The author's response of not wanting anything could be seen as a principled stand against the family's greedy behavior. \n\nBut is there a cultural or social expectation that the author should have expressed a desire for something? In some families, there might be an unspoken assumption that children will take from the inheritance, even if it's not necessary. The author's parents might feel that their child isn't showing appreciation or isn't part of the family dynamic. However, the author's main point is about the step-siblings' behavior and their own discomfort with the situation. \n\nThe step-siblings are acting in a way that's causing conflict, and the author is essentially saying they don't want to get involved in that. The parents' smirk suggests they might have agreed with the author's stance, possibly having a prior discussion. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was a genuine reflection of their feelings or if they were trying to avoid conflict. The step-siblings are the ones being problematic, so the author's refusal to participate in the pre-claiming of items isn't necessarily wrong. They might be in the right to prioritize family harmony and reject the greedy atmosphere. So the answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to take anything, especially given the family's behavior.\n"
