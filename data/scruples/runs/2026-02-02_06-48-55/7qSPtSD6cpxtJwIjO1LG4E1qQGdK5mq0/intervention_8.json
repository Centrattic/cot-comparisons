They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's parents creating their wills and the step-siblings marking up the house with stickers for inheritance. The author says they don't want anything, and the family is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around inheritance. In many societies, it's common for people to expect certain items, especially if they've been marked in advance. The step-siblings have already claimed items with stickers, which might make them feel entitled. The author's refusal could be seen as undermining their parents' plans or not honoring the family's efforts.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author might not want anything for personal reasons. Maybe they don't care about material goods, or they're distancing themselves from the family's avaricious behavior. The story mentions the step-siblings are acting greedy, so the author's choice could be a moral stance against that.\n\nI should also consider if the author was consulted before the items were marked. If the parents were creating the wills and involving the family in the process, maybe the author's input is important. However, by not participating and refusing to take anything, the author might be causing tension. The parents' reaction (mom smirking) suggests they might agree with the author, but the step-siblings are upset.\n\nIs there a breach of etiquette here? If the family is used to claiming items and the author suddenly says they don't want anything, it could be unexpected. But if the author is being honest about their desires, maybe they're in the right. The issue is whether the author's honesty is causing harm to others' expectations.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't taking part in the family's behavior, which could be seen as a positive. They might be rejecting the materialistic approach, which could be commendable. However, if the parents intended to distribute things a certain way, the author's refusal might complicate that.\n\nIn some cases, people might feel that not wanting anything is a way to avoid conflict, but in this case, it's causing conflict. The key is whether the author's actions are disrespectful or just a personal choice. Since the author isn't taking items others have claimed, maybe they're respecting the existing claims, but they're also not taking anything else. The step-siblings' reaction might be more about their own greed than the author's actions.\n\nHmm. I'm torn. On one hand, the author is being honest and not partaking in what they see as greedy behavior. On the other, if the family expects certain things, the author's refusal might be seen as ignoring the family tradition or causing upset. But since the step-siblings were already claiming items, maybe the author isn't at fault. The parents might handle the distribution, so the author's response might just be their personal choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is expressing their genuine feelings and not partaking in what they perceive as vapid behavior. However, if the parents had specific plans, maybe there's a different angle. But based on the info given, the author isn't wrong.\n"
