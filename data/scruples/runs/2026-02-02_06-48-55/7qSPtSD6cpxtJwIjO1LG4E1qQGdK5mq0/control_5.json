They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about inheritance and family dynamics. The main character, who is 40, is part of a family where their stepdad and mom are making their wills. The family members, including step-siblings, are already marking up the house with color-coded stickers for items they want when the parents die. The main character doesn't want anything and says so, leading to a negative reaction from the step-siblings and others.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question hinges on whether the author's response was inappropriate.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author's step-siblings and others are acting greedily, marking up items they want. They're described as \"callow, vapid empty shells\" by the author, indicating the main character's negative view of them.\n2. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, leading to the step-siblings being upset because they thought the author would take something.\n3. The author's parents had a prior conversation that resulted in the mom smirking, suggesting maybe they expected the author to pass on items.\n\nMoral or social wrongness here would depend on cultural norms. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, people have the right to choose what they want (or don't want) from an inheritance. The author is not taking anything, which might be seen as a personal choice. However, the step-siblings are upset because they think the author is not contributing to the \"shopping\" process, but that's their problem if they're greedy.\n\nThe author's response is a personal choice. They aren't obligated to take anything, especially if they don't feel connected to the step-siblings. The other family members' greed and their reaction might indicate they're the problematic ones, not the author. The parents might even be in on it, given the mom's smirk.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for stating they don't want anything. They're making a valid choice, and others' reactions don't make them at fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
