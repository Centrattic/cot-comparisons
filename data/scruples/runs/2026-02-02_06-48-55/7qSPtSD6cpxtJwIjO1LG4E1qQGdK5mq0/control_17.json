They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The context is that the parents are creating their wills, and the step-siblings are all marking up the house with stickers for things they want. The author didn't want anything and just said so, which upset the step-siblings who thought everything was already \"taken.\" The parents seemed to have a prior conversation, as the mom smirked at the stepdad.\n\nSo, first, the author isn't claiming anything. They're just stating they don't want anything. The step-siblings are acting greedy, marking up items. The author's response is a refusal to participate in the scramble. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI think the key points are: the author isn't taking anything, they're not trying to claim items. They might be making a statement against the greed they're witnessing. The parents might have known the author wouldn't want anything, hence the mom's smirk. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something, but since the author didn't, they're left in silence.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Probably not. The right to an inheritance is usually based on the will, and the author is just choosing to decline. It's their choice. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own avarice and maybe their expectation that everyone should take things. The author isn't doing anything wrong here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
