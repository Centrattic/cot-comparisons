They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's parents and step-siblings going through their wills and marking items with stickers. The author didn't want anything from their parents' possessions, which upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The parents are in their 70s and actively creating wills. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, showing they're already planning to take things. The author didn't participate in this and said they don't want anything. The parents then asked the author what they wanted, and the author responded with nothing, leading to a negative reaction from the family.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The step-siblings are acting greedy and the author is distancing themselves. The parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author chose not to, which the step-siblings found surprising or offensive.\n\nI should consider if the author has any obligation to claim items. Since inheritance is a right, the author isn't obligated to take anything. The parents might have their own plans, but the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed than the author's right choice. The author's response is honest and avoids conflict, so they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
