They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the family is already marking up stuff they want. The author didn't want anything and the family was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s. The step-siblings and other family members are acting like they're going to inherit things already, marking items with stickers. The author didn't participate in that and when asked what they wanted, they said nothing. The step-siblings got angry because they thought the author should be claiming stuff too.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't get along with the step-siblings, who are described as greedy and self-absorbed. The author doesn't want anything, maybe because they don't care about the material stuff or don't want to be part of the conflict. But the family was surprised and upset. The parents seemed to have a prior conversation where maybe the author was supposed to claim something, but they didn't.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in terms of legal rights, the author isn't obligated to accept anything from the will. They can disclaim an inheritance if they want. So legally, no wrong there. But socially, maybe. If the parents were expecting the author to express interest, and they didn't, that might have hurt the parents' feelings or upset the family dynamics. But the author's reason is that the step-siblings are greedy and they don't care about the stuff. The author isn't taking anything, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's response was disrespectful or if they have a valid reason not to want anything. Since the author is honest about not wanting to participate in the family's greed, and they're stating their truth, they might not be in the wrong. The parents might have wanted to acknowledge their child's feelings, but the author isn't obligated to pretend interest in things they don't care about. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
