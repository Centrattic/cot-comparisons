They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 40-year-old person whose stepdad and mom are creating their wills. The family is openly fighting over inheritance, using stickers to mark items. The author says they don't want anything and the step-siblings are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's response to their parents' question about what they want. The parents and step-siblings were acting greedy, marking up the house with stickers. The author didn't want to participate in that scramble and declined to take anything. \n\nThe step-siblings were \"incensed\" because the author didn't jump in to take items. But the author's reasoning is that they don't get along well with the step-siblings, who are described as \"callow, vapid empty shells too self-absorbed in their avarice.\" The author's parents were asking directly, so the author answered truthfully that they don't want anything. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the author is not obligated to take anything from the will. The parents are the ones making the wills, so the author's response is honest. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to take something, but the author isn't required to participate in their greed. The fact that the parents were smirking suggests they might have been expecting the author's response, perhaps even encouraging it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical by not wanting to take anything. It's their choice, and they have the right to decline. The real issue might be with the step-siblings and parents' approach to the will and the public marking of items, but the author isn't at fault here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
