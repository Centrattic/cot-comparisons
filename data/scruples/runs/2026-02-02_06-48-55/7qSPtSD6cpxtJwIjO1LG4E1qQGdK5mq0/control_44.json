They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their parents creating wills and the family marking items they want. The author says they don't want anything, which surprises everyone else. The step-siblings are really focused on taking stuff, and the author doesn't want to participate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parents are in their 70s, and the step-siblings are acting very greedily, even putting stickers on items. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings and finds them self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to a negative reaction.\n\nThe key points here are about entitlement and family expectations. In many cultures, there's an unspoken expectation that children might expect an inheritance, especially if they're part of the family. However, the author isn't claiming anything, which could be seen as unexpected or maybe even hurtful to the parents or step-siblings. But the author's reasoning is that the step-siblings are taking things, and they don't want to get involved.\n\nBut is the author wrong for not wanting to take anything? Well, legally, the parents can decide their will as they please. The author isn't obligated to take anything, and their decision is a personal one. The step-siblings' actions seem more greedy, and the author's response might be a way of not engaging in that. The parents might have had a prior conversation (as hinted by the mom smirking) which suggests maybe the author's response aligns with what the parents wanted. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decline taking an inheritance. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedily. The author's honesty about not wanting anything is a valid choice. The answer should be B (No).\n"
