They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 40, and their stepdad and mom, both in their 70s, are creating wills. The family is acting like the stepdad is going to die soon, and everyone's marking stuff they want with stickers. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are claiming things like furniture, tools, and electronics. The author isn't close to the step-siblings, who they describe as greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks the family.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to decline taking anything. Well, legally, people can disinherit someone, but that's not the issue here. The author is stating their own desires, not being disinherited. The family was already dividing things among themselves, which seems a bit off. The author might be annoyed by the greed, and by saying they don't want anything, they're avoiding the conflict and not participating in the squabbling.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation that you should want something? Maybe, but the author is clearly not interested in joining the others in their avarice. They might be showing maturity by not wanting to get involved. The family's reaction is more about their own surprise and maybe feeling that the author is being ungrateful or aloof. But the author isn't taking anything, so there's no actual harm done. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedily, not the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to take anything. The answer should be B.\n"
