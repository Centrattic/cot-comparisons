I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is they went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. They met Jack, who Caroline had a crush on in high school. Caroline started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and the author ended up spending time with Jack. Eventually, they hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. Now Caroline is upset, saying the author ruined her plans to win back Jack and is demanding an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack because she never mentioned it. The author thought they were just meeting Jack as a friend. The author's actions were based on the situation as presented. They formed a connection with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. There's no indication the author was aware of Caroline's intentions or her history with Jack.\n\nOn the other hand, Caroline's actions might be questionable. She invited the author on the trip, then spent most of the time with Paul, possibly to manipulate the situation. She didn't disclose her feelings for Jack to the author, leading the author to form a relationship with Jack without that background knowledge. However, Caroline's plan might be seen as manipulative, but the author wasn't the one who initiated the hook-up; they were responding to the circumstances presented to them.\n\nThe key here is consent and knowledge. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and had no reason to suspect it. The author and Jack's relationship was mutual, and there's no indication of deceit from the author. Caroline's anger stems from her own unspoken plans being disrupted. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information available to them. Caroline's responsibility was to communicate her intentions, which she didn't do. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
