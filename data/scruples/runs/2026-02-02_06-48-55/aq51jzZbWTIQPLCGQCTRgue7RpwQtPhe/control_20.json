I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline, their college friend. Caroline introduced them to Jack, a friend from her past. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting with Paul and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author gets close to Jack and ends up sleeping with him. Caroline gets upset, claims she had a crush on Jack all along and was trying to make him jealous by being with Paul. She's angry that the author didn't realize her intention and now wants an apology.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and knowledge. The author didn't know Caroline had a crush on Jack. Caroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul and then getting upset when someone else pursued Jack\u2014might be the issue. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. Also, Caroline's plan to reconnect with Jack and test his feelings seems a bit manipulative, especially since she was already with Paul. The author was just socializing with Jack, and they both ended up sleeping together. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have noticed Caroline's behavior towards Jack and realized she was interested in him? Or is that expecting too much? Caroline was actively with Paul and not showing her interest in Jack to the author. So, the author couldn't be expected to know. The main problem here is that Caroline was using Paul to try to get Jack's attention, which is a bit sneaky. The author had no reason to believe Jack was off-limits. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't know and acted without malicious intent. The blame might lie more with Caroline for her actions.\n"
