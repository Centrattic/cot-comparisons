I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The situation involves a trip to Germany where the friend, Caroline, reconnects with Jack, her high school crush from five years ago. She brings along the author (the person asking the question) to the trip. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's, ends up hooking up with him, and then the author ends up sleeping with Jack. After the trip, Caroline is upset and confronts the author, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The answer needs to be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack in high school. She planned the trip to Germany, in part, to see if Jack still felt the same. She then started a fling with Paul to try to make Jack jealous. The author, not knowing about Caroline's feelings for Jack, ended up sleeping with him. \n\nCaroline's actions: She didn't inform the author about her feelings for Jack. She used the trip to rekindle a past relationship, which is her own agenda. By choosing to pursue Paul to make Jack jealous, she's manipulating the situation. The author, unaware of Caroline's intentions, forms a connection with Jack. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing Caroline's true feelings for Jack. The author was treated as a friend and companion, and Caroline's actions towards Paul were a red flag for the author. The author was not in a relationship with Caroline, so there's no expectation of loyalty to her. \n\nHowever, the author could argue that they had no way of knowing Caroline's plans. The main issue is whether the author had a duty to avoid Jack because of Caroline's past feelings. Since the author wasn't in a relationship with Caroline and the connection with Jack formed naturally during the trip, the author might not be at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions, especially since she was a close friend. But Caroline didn't make her intentions clear. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize is based on the belief that they had no reason to know. Caroline's behavior during the trip was ambiguous, and it was only after the fact that she revealed her true motives. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's intentions and it's not their responsibility to read between the lines of her actions. Caroline's manipulation of the situation and failure to communicate her feelings properly is the root issue.\n"
