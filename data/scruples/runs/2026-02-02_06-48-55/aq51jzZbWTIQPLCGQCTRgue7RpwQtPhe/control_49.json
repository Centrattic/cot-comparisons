I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack during the trip. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline introduced them to Jack, a friend from her high school days. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's. She ends up hooking up with Paul, while the author gets to know Jack and eventually sleeps with him on the last night. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack back in high school and thought the author should have known that she wanted to reconnect with him, not Paul.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's look at the key points:\n\n1. **Caroline's Intentions**: She went to Germany partly to see her high school crush, Jack. She claims she was only with Paul to make Jack jealous. However, during the trip, she showed clear interest in Paul and didn't indicate any prior feelings for Jack to the author. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's feelings for Jack unless she communicated them. Friendships typically require open communication, so if Caroline didn't express her interest in Jack beforehand, the author can't be expected to know.\n\n2. **The Author's Actions**: The author met Jack through Caroline and formed a connection. Since Caroline was busy with Paul, the author spent time with Jack. There's no indication the author was aware of Caroline's crush until after the fact. Sleeping with Jack in this context seems like a natural outcome of their interactions, especially since Caroline's behavior towards Paul seemed genuine at the time.\n\n3. **Aftermath**: Caroline's reaction is extremely harsh, calling the author derogatory terms and insisting on an apology. Her anger stems from feeling that the author should have known her true intentions. However, the author didn't have that information. It's unfair to hold someone responsible for not reading another person's unspoken intentions, especially in a situation where the other person's actions (flirting with Paul) seemed to indicate different priorities.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The author didn't knowingly interfere with an existing relationship. Caroline was the one who was with Paul during the trip, and the author and Jack formed a connection separately. The author's actions were based on their own experiences and interactions during the trip, without prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings towards Jack.\n\n5. **Communication and Expectations**: Caroline's main issue is that she expected the author to understand her unspoken plan to reconnect with Jack. However, assuming that level of insight without explicit communication is unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to navigate someone else's hidden romantic agenda unless it's clearly communicated.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on the information available to them and the interactions they had. Caroline's failure to communicate her feelings and intentions is a significant factor here. The author has no responsibility to second-guess hidden motives when they weren't apparent during the trip.\n"
