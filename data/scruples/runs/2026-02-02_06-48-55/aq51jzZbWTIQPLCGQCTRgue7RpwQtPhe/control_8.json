I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with her high school friend Jack, and they met Paul. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ignoring others, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, and they got close. On the last night, the author and Jack slept together. The next day, Caroline was upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She accused the author of being a slut and ruining the trip, still demanding an apology a month later.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Key points here are consent and intent. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack; they were just following along with the plans. Caroline was the one who initiated interactions with Paul first, and the author was left with Jack. The author had a relationship with Jack, who was not in a committed relationship at the time. There's no indication that Jack was with someone else, so the author's actions were consensual and based on their own connection with him.\n\nCaroline's actions also need to be considered. She was the one who was actively pursuing Paul and then later got upset that the author ended up with Jack. Her planning the trip with the specific intent to reconnect with Jack and test his feelings might be manipulative. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's motivations, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for Caroline's own deceptions.\n\nThe author's response was to stand their ground, explaining they couldn't have known Caroline's feelings for Jack. The fact that Caroline continued to pressure for an apology a month later suggests her reaction is more about her own failed plan rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted on their own feelings and the situation as it presented itself, without prior knowledge of Caroline's intentions.\n"
