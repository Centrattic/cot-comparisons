I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. She invited the author, and during the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ends up hooking up with him, and then the author ends up getting close to and sleeping with Jack, who Caroline had a high school crush on. Caroline gets really angry and is still upset a month later.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author was invited on the trip by Caroline. Caroline reconnected with Jack and his friends. She was very into Paul, ignoring others, including the author. The author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually sleeping with him while Caroline was with Paul. Caroline later accuses the author of ruining the trip because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known not to get involved.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author was just following along as a friend, and when Caroline was with Paul, the author interacted with Jack. The author didn't intentionally sabotage anything, as far as we know. The key here is whether the author had any reason to be aware of Caroline's intentions with Jack. Since Caroline was clearly with Paul the whole trip and was ignoring others, the author might not have had any indication that she was trying to get Jack's attention.\n\nOn the other hand, Caroline is upset because she thought the trip was to reconnect with Jack and that the author should have realized her true intentions. But the author couldn't have known. The author's actions weren't malicious. It was a consensual relationship between the author and Jack. Caroline's anger might stem from her own mixed signals and not clearly communicating her feelings to the author.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did anything wrong. The author didn't know about the crush, didn't interfere with anything, and the relationship with Jack was consensual. The problem lies more with Caroline's expectations and her failure to communicate her intentions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's hidden agenda.\n"
