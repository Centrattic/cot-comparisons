I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a college friend, Caroline, who invited the author on a trip to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ends up hooking up with him, and then the author ends up forming a connection with Jack. The author and Jack end up sleeping together, which makes Caroline really angry because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought she was using Paul to get his attention.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. Let's break down the facts. The author was invited by Caroline and met Jack through her. Caroline was the one who was initially flirting with Paul, and the author ended up bonding with Jack, possibly while Caroline was distracted. The key points here are consent and manipulation. \n\nCaroline planned the trip partly to reunite with Jack, but she didn't communicate her feelings to the author. She used Paul to try to get Jack's attention, which might be manipulative. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and had no way of knowing that. The author's actions with Jack were consensual and based on the connection they formed during the trip. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they were just following the situation as it unfolded. They didn't know about Caroline's intentions and were responding to Jack's interest. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't clearly communicate her feelings and used Paul to manipulate the situation. The author isn't at fault for not knowing about Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nAdditionally, Caroline's reaction of flipping out and continuing to demand an apology a month later might indicate her own manipulative behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for acting on a genuine connection with Jack without awareness of Caroline's hidden motives. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
