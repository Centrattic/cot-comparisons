I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline had a high school crush on Jack from when she studied in Germany a few years back. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author and Jack grew closer and ended up having a relationship. When the author told Caroline about this, she flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. Now Caroline is upset and demanding an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries and intentions. Caroline invited the author on the trip. But during the trip, Caroline was actively pursuing Paul, ignoring others, and had a hook-up with him. The author and Jack started getting close because Caroline's actions left the author with Jack. The key point here is whether Caroline's initial actions were manipulative. She claimed she was using Paul to make Jack jealous, which might mean she wasn't honest about her intentions. If Caroline was using Paul, then maybe she was being deceptive.\n\nThe author had no way of knowing about Caroline's crush on Jack because she didn't communicate it. The author and Jack spent time together because Caroline wasn't engaging with the group, and the author filled the void. The author wasn't aware of the crush and didn't know Caroline's plan. So the author's relationship with Jack wasn't based on deception since they had no information about Caroline's feelings.\n\nCaroline's anger stems from her own manipulation and lack of communication. She didn't make it clear that she was still interested in Jack, leading the author to form a bond with him. The author isn't at fault for acting on the situation as it was presented. Caroline's actions (using Paul to make Jack jealous) also contributed to the problem. The author had no responsibility to know about Caroline's hidden agenda.\n\nAnother angle: friendship dynamics. Caroline brought the author along, which might imply trust. However, the author didn't interfere with Caroline's relationships; they just formed their own. The main issue is Caroline's lack of communication and manipulation. The author isn't obligated to apologize for something beyond their knowledge and control.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The blame lies more with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and manipulating the situation.\n"
