I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me start by breaking down the story.\n\nThe author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of her friend Jack. They end up hooking up on the first night. Then, over the next ten days, Caroline keeps meeting Paul, and the author ends up spending time with Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hook up when Caroline and Paul are out. When the author tells Caroline about sleeping with Jack, Caroline gets really upset, saying she had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to rekindle that. She accuses the author of ruining the trip and demands an apology. The author refuses and now is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Caroline's intentions were to reconnect with Jack, but she didn't explicitly state that to the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and thought she was genuinely interested in Paul. The author spent time with Jack because Caroline was preoccupied with Paul. The author didn't know about Caroline's plans and didn't have any indication that Jack was her target. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, did the author have a right to be with Jack? Well, Caroline didn't make her intentions clear. The author wasn't aware of the crush and wasn't in on the plan. Even if Caroline had a crush on Jack, she didn't communicate that to the author, so the author couldn't have known that Jack was off-limits. The author was just being friendly and ended up forming a connection with Jack because Caroline wasn't paying attention. \n\nOn the other hand, Caroline might feel betrayed because she used Paul to get Jack's attention, but the author wasn't involved in that. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's actions. However, maybe Caroline expected the author to notice her intentions and not get involved with Jack. But that seems like an unfair burden on the author, as people aren't mind readers. \n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction of calling the author names and demanding an apology seems harsh. The author didn't know about the crush and didn't have any reason to avoid Jack. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not on any prior knowledge of Caroline's plans. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's possible that Caroline didn't communicate her intentions, making the author not at fault. The author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the information to know that Jack was a no-go. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
