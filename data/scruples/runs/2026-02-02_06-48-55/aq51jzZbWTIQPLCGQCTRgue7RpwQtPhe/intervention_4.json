I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (let's call them \"Person A\") is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, Caroline's high school crush, during a trip Caroline organized. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Caroline invited Person A to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ends up hooking up with him, and then for the rest of the trip, she's focused on Paul. Meanwhile, Person A gets closer to Jack, who was part of the group. Eventually, Person A and Jack hook up. When Caroline finds out, she's furious, saying she had a crush on Jack and had planned the trip to see if he still liked her. She accuses Person A of ruining it by taking Jack.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent, intentions, and boundaries. Caroline didn't tell Person A about her feelings for Jack or her plan to reconnect with him. She kept those intentions private. Person A didn't know about Caroline's crush or her strategy to use Paul to get Jack's attention. So, from Person A's perspective, they were just getting to know Jack and ended up in a relationship naturally. \n\nBut Caroline's main issue is that she felt Person A took Jack from her, which is complicated because she didn't communicate her intentions. If Caroline had been honest from the start about her feelings for Jack and her plan, maybe Person A could have navigated the situation differently. However, since she didn't, Person A had no way of knowing that Jack was off-limits.\n\nAnother angle is whether Person A had any responsibility to stay away from Jack. Since there was no prior information about Caroline's feelings, Person A couldn't have known. It's possible that Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul) were a red flag, but that's speculative. Person A was just following the social interactions that happened during the trip.\n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction seems extreme. She's been angry for over a month, demanding an apology. Her planning the trip with the sole intent to pursue Jack might be a bit self-centered, but that's her decision. However, Person A's actions don't seem malicious. They were in a situation where they formed a bond with Jack, who was available and not explicitly claimed by Caroline until after the fact.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, if someone is in a group setting and people are connecting, it's hard to say who is off-limits unless it's clear. Since Caroline didn't communicate her intentions to Person A, her anger might stem from her own miscalculations rather than Person A's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Person A didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. They had no reason to believe Jack was off-limits. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong for forming a relationship with Jack. Caroline's failure to communicate her intentions and her manipulative strategy (using Paul to get Jack's attention) might be the real issue here. Hence, the answer would be B\u2014Person A is not in the wrong.\n"
