I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend Jack from her high school days and introduced the author to him. Then, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. The author mentions that during the trip, while Caroline was with Paul, she and Jack got closer. Eventually, the author and Jack ended up hooking up. \n\nWhen the author told Caroline about the hook-up, Caroline flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and that she planned the trip to Germany to see if he still had feelings for her. She also said she only got with Paul to make Jack jealous. Now, Caroline is angry at the author for sleeping with Jack, demanding an apology.\n\nThe author refuses to apologize, feeling that they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions and that Caroline's actions were manipulative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me break this down. The key points are:\n\n1. Caroline's actions: She had a past crush on Jack and planned the trip to Germany to rekindle that. She used Paul as a way to make Jack jealous. This seems manipulative. She was the one initiating the flirtation with Paul, which led to her hooking up with him. She also ignored the author during the trip, focusing on Paul.\n\n2. The author's actions: The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. They formed a connection with Jack while Caroline was busy with Paul. The hook-up between the author and Jack happened when Caroline and Paul were out. The author didn't know about Caroline's intentions and thought they were just enjoying the trip.\n\n3. The aftermath: Caroline is upset because the author slept with Jack, whom she had a crush on. She's calling the author names and demanding an apology. The author feels they did nothing wrong because they couldn't have known Caroline's plans.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. If Caroline was using Paul to manipulate Jack's feelings, that's her responsibility. The author wasn't aware of this and was just getting to know Jack. Since Caroline was the one who was actively pursuing Paul, the author isn't at fault for forming a connection with Jack when she wasn't around. Also, the author didn't know that Caroline had a crush on Jack, so there's no intent to sabotage her plans. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her feelings or her intentions clearly. The author acted on their own connection, not knowing the back story.\n\nAnother angle: Was the author's hook-up with Jack a betrayal of the friendship? If they were close friends and Caroline had a crush, maybe the author should have been more careful. But since Caroline didn't communicate her feelings, the author couldn't have known. Also, Caroline was the one who brought Jack into the situation by meeting him and then using Paul to manipulate the dynamics. The author's actions were more a result of Caroline's manipulative behavior rather than their own wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Caroline's actions were manipulative and she didn't communicate her intentions, leading to the situation. The author had no way of knowing and acted on their own connection. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
