I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a trip with Caroline to Germany. Caroline had a friend from her high school exchange program, Jack. On the trip, Caroline started flirting with another friend of Jack's, Paul, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, got close, and ended up sleeping with him. When the author told Caroline, she got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to make him jealous. Now, Caroline is upset and wants an apology, but the author refuses.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another perspective. Let's break down the key points.\n\nCaroline's actions: She invited the author on the trip. During the trip, she openly flirted with Paul and hooked up with him. She didn't mention her feelings for Jack to the author before the trip. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. The author formed a relationship with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. Caroline later claims she used Paul to make Jack jealous, but the author had no way of knowing this.\n\nThe author's actions: The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. They spent time with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. The author and Jack were both single and didn't know about Caroline's intentions. The author didn't intentionally interfere; they just pursued a connection they felt while on the trip with someone who was single.\n\nNow, considering social norms and consent: If Jack was single and not in a relationship, and the author believed he was available, then forming a relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, Caroline's actions complicate things. She didn't communicate her intentions to the author, which might have led to misunderstandings. But the author had no way of knowing Caroline's true feelings for Jack. Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous could be seen as manipulative, but the author isn't responsible for that.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack. If the author didn't know about Caroline's crush and Jack was single, then the author isn't at fault. Caroline's anger stems from her own actions and lack of communication. The author didn't betray Caroline's trust because there was no prior indication of her feelings. The key here is intent and knowledge. Since the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions, they can't be blamed for the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's true intentions and both the author and Jack were single at the time.\n"
