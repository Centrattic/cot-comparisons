I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, the high school crush of their college friend Caroline, during a trip to Germany.\n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ends up hooking up with him, and then seems to ignore the author. Meanwhile, the author gets close to Jack, who is Jack's friend. The author and Jack end up hooking up when Paul and Caroline are out. Caroline then gets upset, claims she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to make him jealous, and accuses the author of ruining the trip. The author refuses to apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author's actions led to Caroline's anger. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack, as she never mentioned it. The author was just spending time with Jack when opportunities arose. But Caroline had her own manipulative intentions with Paul to get Jack's attention. The author didn't know about that plan and acted on their own feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't know Caroline's intentions. They were just getting to know Jack, who was also part of the group. The author didn't have a way to know that Jack was Caroline's crush. However, maybe there was a lack of communication. But since Caroline never mentioned her crush, the author couldn't be expected to know. The author's actions were based on their own experiences with Jack during the trip. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the necessary information to know that Jack was Caroline's off-limits person. Caroline's actions were more manipulative by using Paul to get Jack's attention, and then being upset when someone else connected with Jack. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
