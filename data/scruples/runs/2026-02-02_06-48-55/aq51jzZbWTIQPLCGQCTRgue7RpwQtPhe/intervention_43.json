I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend, Caroline, who had a high school crush on a guy named Jack. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, even hooking up with him, while the author ends up getting closer to Jack and they end up sleeping together. Caroline gets really upset, accuses the author of being a slut, and is still mad a month later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a friend of Caroline's, and they were both on a trip she organized. Caroline had a history with Jack from high school and went on this trip partly to reconnect with him. She then started up a relationship with Paul, which was public, and the author ended up with Jack. \n\nI wonder if Caroline had any expectations about her crush on Jack. If she planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings for her, but then started dating Paul to make Jack jealous, maybe she was using Paul as a way to test Jack. But if she didn't communicate this to the author, then the author wouldn't have known. The author might not have realized that Caroline was trying to play a game with Jack, so they ended up in a relationship with him instead.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were just getting to know Jack during the trip, and since Caroline was already involved with Paul, the author might not have seen any red flags. However, Caroline's actions were a bit manipulative\u2014she used Paul to try to get Jack's attention, but then got upset when the author ended up with Jack. \n\nIs the author wrong for not knowing Caroline's intentions? Probably not, because Caroline didn't communicate her feelings openly. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline was still interested in Jack. Also, the author was in a situation where they were getting close to someone, which is normal. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that Caroline felt the author was complicit in her scheme, even if they weren't. She might feel that the author should have figured out her true intentions, which isn't reasonable. The author isn't obligated to read Caroline's mind. \n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction seems extreme. She's angry at the author for something that wasn't directly their fault. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and just acted on their own feelings. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't have known Caroline's hidden motives. The fault might lie more with Caroline for not being upfront and for her manipulative behavior.\n"
