I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let's break down the details.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnects with a friend Jack and introduces the author to his group, including Paul. Caroline starts heavily flirting with Paul, ignores the author, hooks up with Paul, and during the trip, Caroline is mostly with Paul while the author spends time with Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hook up when Paul and Caroline are out. The next day, Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings, using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author refused to apologize, and now Caroline is still angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the intentions and the boundaries. Caroline was using Paul to get to Jack, and the author ended up with Jack. But was the author aware of Caroline's intentions? The author states they had no way of knowing she had a crush on Jack. If that's true, then the author didn't intentionally interfere. However, Caroline's actions might be questionable too\u2014using Paul as a means to an end. But the author was just getting to know Jack while Caroline was with Paul. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, then maybe not. But if Caroline was planning the trip specifically to pursue Jack, perhaps the author should have considered if Jack was in a relationship or not. However, there's no indication that Jack was in a relationship with Caroline or Paul at the time. Wait, Caroline hooked up with Paul, so maybe Paul was just a fling. But Jack's feelings towards Caroline aren't clear. The author and Jack were both getting to know each other, and they ended up together. \n\nBut Caroline's anger stems from her own manipulative behavior. She used Paul to get Jack's attention and then blames the author for sleeping with Jack. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted on mutual feelings with Jack, who might have been available. However, the author could be in the wrong if Jack was actually interested in Caroline and the author knew or should have known. But the author had no way of knowing Caroline's history with Jack. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were based on the situation as they knew it. Caroline's manipulation and hidden agenda complicate things. The author isn't necessarily at fault because they weren't aware of Caroline's intentions. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
