I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, the high school crush of their friend Caroline. \n\nFirst, the situation: Caroline invited the author on a trip to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and while the author ends up getting close to Jack. At the end, the author sleeps with Jack while Caroline is out with Paul. Caroline gets angry because she had a crush on Jack and thought she was trying to win him back during the trip. She accuses the author of being a slut and ruining the trip. The author refuses to apologize, thinking they had no way of knowing about Caroline's intentions.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did the author have any prior knowledge that Jack was someone Caroline was interested in? The author met Jack through Caroline and Caroline's friend Paul. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. The author's actions were based on the assumption that Jack was available, since Caroline was with Paul. \n\nCaroline's actions might be questionable too. She invited the author, started the trip by hooking up with Paul, and didn't mention her feelings for Jack until after the author had already connected with him. It seems like Caroline might have been using Paul as a way to try to attract Jack. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. \n\nThe author didn't do anything deceitful. They were honest about the situation when it came up. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't set boundaries or communicate her feelings clearly before the trip. The author wasn't aware they were in the way of Caroline's plans. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on their own connections without prior knowledge. The main issue is Caroline's lack of communication and her own actions leading up to the situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
