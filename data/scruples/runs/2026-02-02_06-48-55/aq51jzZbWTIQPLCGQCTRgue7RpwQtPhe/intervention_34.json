I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, the friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had a friend from her high school study abroad program, Jack. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with another friend of Jack's, Paul, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, and they got close. On the last night, the author and Jack slept together. The next morning, Caroline was furious because she had a crush on Jack from her high school days and thought the trip was a way to see if Jack still felt the same. She was using Paul to make Jack jealous, but the author didn't know that. Now, Caroline is upset and demanding an apology.\n\nSo, the key points here are about intentions and knowledge. Caroline had a hidden agenda: she wanted to reconnect with Jack and was using Paul as a distraction. The author didn't know about this. The author thought they were just hanging out with Jack during the trip, not knowing that Caroline had an old crush on him. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong because they slept with Jack without knowing that Caroline had a crush on him. But wait, Caroline was already with Paul, right? She hooked up with Paul on the first night. So she was in a relationship with Paul during the trip. If that's the case, then the author sleeping with Jack wouldn't be cheating on Caroline, because Caroline wasn't in a relationship with Jack. Wait, but Caroline was trying to get Jack to like her by being with Paul. But she wasn't in a relationship with Jack. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because Caroline wasn't in a relationship with Jack when the author slept with him. Also, the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. \n\nBut then, Caroline might be upset because she saw the author as a friend and thought the author should have helped her by not getting involved with Jack. However, the author couldn't have known Caroline's intentions. Caroline didn't communicate that she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to test him. The author isn't responsible for reading Caroline's mind. \n\nAlso, the author was left alone with Jack because Caroline was with Paul. So the author's actions weren't intentional to hurt Caroline, but rather a result of the situation Caroline created. Caroline might have brought Jack into the mix, but she didn't clarify her own intentions. \n\nIn terms of accountability, it's possible that Caroline's actions led to the situation. She was using Paul to get Jack's attention, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's actions were based on the information available at the time, which didn't include Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't know about Caroline's feelings and weren't cheating on her. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for manipulating the situations to get Jack's attention. The author acted based on the circumstances provided, without knowledge of the hidden agenda.\n"
