I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the writer is a college friend of Caroline's. They went on a trip to Germany together. Caroline had previously studied in Germany and reconnected with a friend Jack, whom she's known since high school. She invited the writer to meet Jack and a group of his friends. On the first night, Caroline starts heavily flirting with Paul, one of Jack's friends, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the writer ends up spending time with Jack, and over the 10 days, they get close. On the last night, when Caroline and Paul are out, the writer and Jack hook up. The next morning, Caroline gets angry, says the writer is an asshole, and claims she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her, using Paul to make Jack jealous. The writer refuses to apologize, and now Caroline is still upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let me consider the key points here.\n\n1. **Caroline's Intentions**: She had a high school crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings for her. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. However, the writer didn't know this. Is it fair to expect the writer to have known? Probably not, since Caroline didn't communicate her intentions clearly. She didn't tell the writer about her crush or her plan involving Paul. The writer had no way of knowing that Jack was off-limits because of her plan.\n\n2. **Timing and Circumstances**: The writer and Jack hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. Caroline was the one who was with Paul the night before, so maybe she had some emotional investment there. However, the main issue is whether the writer had reason to believe Jack was off-limits. Since Caroline didn't indicate that, and Jack was part of the group, it's unclear if there was a prior relationship between Caroline and Jack beyond her crush.\n\n3. **Communication**: The crux here is communication. Caroline didn't tell the writer about her feelings for Jack or her plans. The writer couldn't reasonably know that Caroline was trying to reconnect with Jack. It's possible Caroline's actions (like flirting with Paul) could be a red flag, but unless explicitly stated, the writer can't be faulted for not reading between the lines. People aren't mind readers, so Caroline's lack of communication is a problem here.\n\n4. **Friendship and Boundaries**: The writer is a friend of Caroline's. If Caroline had any concerns about her crush on Jack, she should have communicated that to her friend before the trip. The writer wasn't aware of the situation and acted on their own connection with Jack. It's possible that Caroline's jealousy is misplaced, especially since she didn't establish clear boundaries beforehand.\n\n5. **Caroline's Reaction**: Caroline's anger seems to stem from the fact that the writer didn't know about her plan and didn't stop it. However, the writer had no obligation to intervene, especially since they weren't privy to Caroline's intentions. Her reaction might be more about her own failed attempt to win Jack back rather than the writer's actions being inherently wrong.\n\n6. **Consent and Agency**: Both the writer and Jack were adults and made a choice to hook up. Neither was forced, and the writer didn't know about Caroline's feelings. The writer's actions were consensual and based on their own interactions with Jack during the trip. Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous might have been manipulative, but that's more on her than the writer.\n\nIn summary, the writer didn't have the necessary information to know that Jack was off-limits. Caroline didn't communicate her intentions, so the writer isn't in the wrong for acting on their connection with Jack. The fault lies more with Caroline for not being clear about her intentions and for using Paul as a ploy without discussing it with her friend.\n"
