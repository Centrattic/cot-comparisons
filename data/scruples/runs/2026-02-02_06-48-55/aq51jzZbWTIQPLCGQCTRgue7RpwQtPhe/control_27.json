I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main points: The author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. Caroline met someone named Jack, her high school crush from 5 years ago, during the trip. She also hooked up with Paul, but later seemed upset that the author ended up with Jack.\n\nWait, the author says that Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul during the trip, which led to them hooking up. Meanwhile, the author got closer to Jack. At the end, the author and Jack hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. Then Caroline flipped out, saying she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her, and that she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's now angry at the author for sleeping with Jack.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack during the trip. Caroline was the one who was flirting with Paul, so maybe she gave the impression she wasn't interested in Jack anymore. The author and Jack grew close, and they had a connection. Caroline only revealed her true feelings after the fact. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were acting on their own feelings and the situation that was presented to them. Caroline's intentions were hidden. The author didn't know she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. So the author might not be in the wrong because they couldn't have known. However, maybe there's some responsibility if the author noticed Caroline's behavior towards Paul was a cover, but the story says Caroline was openly flirting with Paul, so it seems genuine to the author.\n\nAlso, Caroline planned the trip to reconnect with Jack, but she didn't disclose her feelings. The author was just following along. So the issue is whether the author is responsible for not reading between the lines. But if Caroline was with Paul and ignoring the author, it's not clear she was leading Jack on. The author had no reason to suspect she was using Paul to get Jack's attention. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
