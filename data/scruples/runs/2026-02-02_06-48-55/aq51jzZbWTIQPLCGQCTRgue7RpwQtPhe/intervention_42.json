I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush during a trip to Germany.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their friend Caroline went to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school program there. She introduced the author to Jack's friend Paul. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, and they grew closer. On the last night, the author and Jack hooked up. The next day, Caroline flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. She also accused the author of ruining the trip and being a slut. The author refuses to apologize and is now questioning their actions.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did the author have a right to sleep with Jack, considering Caroline's intentions? The key here is whether the author knew about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author states they had no way of knowing. They were told Jack and Caroline were friends, but the author didn't realize Caroline was using Paul to get Jack's attention. \n\nCaroline's actions: She planned the trip in part to check if Jack still liked her. She then hooked up with Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know this. The author and Jack formed a connection during the trip, and their hook-up happened on the last night while Caroline and Paul were out. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the author truly didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, then they might not be at fault. They were interacting with Jack as a friend, and the relationship happened organically. However, if there were signs that Caroline was using Paul to get to Jack, and the author ignored those signs, they might share some responsibility. But the author claims they didn't realize. \n\nAnother angle: The author and Caroline were friends. If Caroline had a crush on Jack, maybe the author should have been more aware of her feelings and not pursued Jack. But Caroline didn't make her intentions clear. The author could argue they had no way of knowing. \n\nCaroline's reaction is extreme. She's continuing to demand an apology months later, which might indicate her own issues with handling the situation. The author might feel justified in not apologizing since they didn't know. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sleeping with a close friend's crush could be seen as crossing a line if the friend had unexpressed feelings. However, if those feelings weren't communicated, the author can't be expected to know. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on whether the author had knowledge of Caroline's feelings. Since the author says they didn't, and Caroline didn't communicate her intentions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is Caroline's manipulation by using Paul, which the author wasn't aware of. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
