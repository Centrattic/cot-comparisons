I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a trip with Caroline, who reconnected with Jack. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author and Jack grew closer and ended up sleeping together. Caroline later flipped out because she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. She planned the trip to check if Jack still liked her.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, knowledge, and intentions. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack because Caroline was actively pursuing Paul. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions since she was with Paul the whole time. The author's actions were based on their own connection with Jack, not knowing that Caroline had a history with him. \n\nCaroline's actions also play a role here. She was the one who initiated the trip and connected with Paul, which might have led the author to interact with Jack. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's plan, so they couldn't have avoided it. The author's refusal to apologize seems justified because they were in the dark about Caroline's intentions. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the information to know that Jack was off-limits. Caroline's jealousy and anger come from her own actions of pursuing Paul first and then projecting her intentions onto the author. The author's relationship with Jack happened without prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings, so there's no wrongdoing there. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
