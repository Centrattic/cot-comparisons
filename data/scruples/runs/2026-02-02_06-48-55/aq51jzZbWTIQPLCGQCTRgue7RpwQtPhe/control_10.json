I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. Caroline introduced them to Jack, a friend from her high school study abroad program. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's. They ended up hooking up. Meanwhile, the author and Jack spent time together and ended up having a relationship. When the author told Caroline about hooking up with Jack, Caroline flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to get him to notice her. She also accused the author of ruining the trip.\n\nThe key points here: Caroline was the one who initiated contact with Jack by bringing the author along. She then pursued Paul, leaving the author to be with Jack. The author had no idea about Caroline's crush on Jack and was led to believe that Caroline was interested in Paul. Caroline's actions during the trip, like ignoring the author and focusing on Paul, might have given the impression that she was done with Jack. The author isn't in a relationship with Caroline and wasn't aware of her intentions regarding Jack. \n\nCaroline planned the trip partly to see Jack again, but she didn't disclose that to the author at the time. The author's actions were based on the current interactions during the trip, not prior knowledge of Caroline's past feelings. The author isn't at fault for acting on the situation as it presented during the trip. Caroline's anger seems to stem from her own mixed signals and not clearly communicating her intentions. The author didn't know about the crush and had no reason to be suspicious, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
