I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who asked the AITA question) is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, a friend of their college friend Caroline. \n\nFirst, let's recount the situation. The author went on a trip with Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with her old friend Jack and introduced the author to him and Jack's friend Paul. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ended up hooking up with him, and then over the next ten days, Caroline kept seeing Paul, who needed Jack to accompany him. Meanwhile, the author got closer to Jack and ended up hooking up with him when Caroline and Paul were out. \n\nCaroline then got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack from her high school days and that she brought the author to Germany to test if Jack still had feelings for her. She accused the author of ruining the trip by sleeping with Jack. The author refuses to apologize, thinking they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider a few angles.\n\n1. **Intentions and Deception**: Caroline's actions were part of a plan to test Jack. She used Paul to get close to Jack and maybe make him jealous. This is a bit manipulative. The author was not aware of this and was just socializing with Jack during the trip. The author had no prior knowledge of Caroline's crush on Jack, so they couldn't have known their actions would interfere with Caroline's plan.\n\n2. **Friendship and Boundaries**: The author was a friend of Caroline and was invited on the trip. It's possible that Caroline didn't communicate her intentions clearly. The author didn't know about the crush and thus didn't have any malicious intent. They were acting on their own feelings or connection with Jack during the trip.\n\n3. **Consent and Mutual Interest**: The author and Jack had a relationship during the trip. If both were interested and consented, then the act itself wasn't wrong. The issue is more about Caroline's expectations and the author not meeting them. However, the author couldn't have foreseen Caroline's high school crush and her manipulative tactics.\n\n4. **Responsibility**: The key point is that Caroline's actions were self-serving. She manipulated the situation to get back at Jack or test his feelings. The author was an unwitting participant in this scenario. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\n5. **Right to Form Relationships**: The author was in Germany as a guest, and while on the trip, they formed a connection with Jack. Unless there were prior agreements about relationships during the trip, the author had the right to pursue a relationship. Caroline's anger stems from her own plans being thwarted, not from the author doing something inherently wrong.\n\n6. **Communication Issues**: The main problem here is a lack of communication. Caroline didn't express her feelings or intentions to the author. The author couldn't have avoided the situation if they were unaware. \n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's intentions and within their rights to form a relationship with Jack. Caroline's actions are more questionable due to her manipulation and lack of transparency. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
