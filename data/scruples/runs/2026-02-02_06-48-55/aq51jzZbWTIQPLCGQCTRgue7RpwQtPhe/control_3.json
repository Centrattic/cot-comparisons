I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her friend from when she studied in Germany. The author met Jack and other friends. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, who was Jack's friend. She hooked up with Paul on the first night. Then, over the trip, Caroline kept seeing Paul, while the author spent time with Jack and eventually they hooked up. Caroline got angry, saying she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to get his attention. She's angry the author didn't realize this and slept with Jack.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong because they didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. Caroline was the one who was flirting with Paul, making out with him, and the author had no way of knowing she was trying to get Jack's attention. The author also found out later that Caroline had a high school crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings. The author refuses to apologize, thinking they did nothing wrong.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The author didn't know about Caroline's intent to reconnect with Jack. Caroline was the one who was actively pursuing Paul, which the author was not involved with. The author formed a connection with Jack, who was available (since Jack's friend Paul was the one Caroline was with). Jack was part of the group, and the author and Jack developed a relationship during the trip. Caroline's actions were misleading because she was using Paul to get Jack's attention, which she didn't make clear to the author. The author couldn't have known her plan, so they had no reason to avoid Jack.\n\nCaroline's anger seems misplaced because she led the author to believe Paul was the one she was interested in. The author isn't at fault for forming a relationship with someone who was available and not in a relationship at the time (assuming Paul and Caroline weren't an official couple yet). Also, Caroline's actions were manipulative in a way that put the author in an unexpected situation. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
