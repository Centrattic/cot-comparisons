I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person (let's call them the asker) went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had a friend from when she studied there named Jack. They meet Jack and his friend Paul. Caroline starts heavily flirting with Paul, ignores the asker, and ends up hooking up with Paul on the first night. Then, for the rest of the trip, Caroline keeps seeing Paul, but Paul doesn't have a car, so he comes with Jack. Meanwhile, the asker spends time with Jack and they get close. On the last night, when Caroline and Paul are out, the asker and Jack hook up. The next morning, Caroline is furious, says the asker is an asshole, and accuses them of ruining the trip. The asker refuses to apologize, and now Caroline is still angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the asker is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, Caroline's intentions. She had a high school crush on Jack from 5 years ago. She planned the trip to Germany partly to see if Jack still had feelings for her. She used Paul to make Jack jealous, according to what she told the asker. The asker didn't know any of this because Caroline didn't communicate that to them. The asker thought Caroline was genuinely interested in Paul. \n\nSo, the asker's actions: They didn't know Caroline's plan. They spent time with Jack because Paul didn't have a car, so Jack was around. They developed a connection with Jack, and eventually had sex. The asker didn't know Caroline was using Paul to get Jack's attention. The asker had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions because she didn't communicate that. \n\nCaroline's reaction is that she's upset because the asker didn't follow her plan. But from the asker's perspective, they were just being friendly with Jack, and when they ended up hooking up, it's because they felt a connection. The asker had no idea Caroline had a crush on Jack. They were not aware that Caroline was manipulating the situation by using Paul to get Jack's attention. \n\nNow, the question is: Was the asker in the wrong? The key factors here are consent, communication, and intent. The asker didn't know about Caroline's crush and her plan. They were just being friends with Jack, and then had a romantic/sexual relationship with him. Caroline didn't tell the asker about her feelings for Jack, so the asker couldn't have known. \n\nEthically, if someone is involved with someone else's significant other, that's a problem. But in this case, Caroline wasn't in a relationship with Jack. She was using Paul as a means to an end. The asker didn't know that. So, from the asker's perspective, they weren't aware they were interfering in any way. \n\nHowever, maybe the asker could have been more cautious. If they noticed that Caroline was using Paul to get to Jack, perhaps they should have questioned it. But according to the story, Caroline was actively ignoring the asker and being with Paul. The asker was left alone with Jack, which led to their connection. The asker didn't know Caroline's plan, so they couldn't have avoided it. \n\nAnother angle: Was the asker complicit in Caroline's manipulation? If the asker had known about Caroline's plan, maybe they should have stepped back. But since they didn't know, they couldn't. \n\nCaroline's anger seems to stem from her own manipulation backfiring. She used Paul to get close to Jack, but then the asker and Jack formed a relationship. She's upset because her plan didn't work, and she's taking it out on the asker. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the asker isn't in the wrong because they didn't have knowledge of Caroline's intentions. They were honest about their feelings once they had sex with Jack. The problem lies with Caroline for not communicating her feelings and for manipulating the situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The asker isn't at fault because they couldn't have known Caroline's true intentions. Caroline's actions were deceptive, and the asker acted based on the information they had at the time.\n"
