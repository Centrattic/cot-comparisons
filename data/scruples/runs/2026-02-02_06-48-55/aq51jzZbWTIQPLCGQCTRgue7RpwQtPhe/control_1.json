I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline, who reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school time in Germany. Caroline also met Paul, and they hooked up. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and had sex with him. Caroline got really upset, saying she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to make him jealous. She's mad at the author for sleeping with Jack.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. Caroline invited the author on the trip. She was heavily flirting with Paul during the trip, hooked up with him, and didn't seem to be interested in Jack initially. The author got close to Jack because Caroline was otherwise occupied. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. Caroline planned the trip to check if Jack had feelings for her. She's now upset because the author slept with Jack, thinking the author should have known she liked Jack instead of Paul.\n\nSo the key points here: Was there any deception or prior expectations? Caroline didn't tell the author that she had a crush on Jack, nor did she indicate that she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author had no way of knowing that. The author was just socializing with Jack since Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't do anything to interfere with Caroline's plans because they weren't aware of them. \n\nCaroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her intentions. The author wasn't aware that Jack was her target, so there's no way the author could have avoided sleeping with Jack. Also, Caroline's actions (hooking up with Paul) might have led Jack to believe he wasn't the one she was interested in. The author's actions weren't malicious; they acted based on the information they had. \n\nIt's possible that Caroline's expectations were unreasonable. She used the trip to test Jack's feelings without telling anyone, and when her plan failed, she blamed the author. The author isn't to blame here because they had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
