I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip with Caroline, who reconnected with Jack, her high school crush. Caroline started flirting with Paul, another friend, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, and they ended up sleeping together. Caroline got angry because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known not to go after him.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Let's consider the key points. Caroline had a prior connection with Jack from high school and planned the trip possibly to reconnect with him. However, during the trip, she chose to pursue Paul instead, maybe to make Jack jealous. The author, not knowing about Caroline's intentions, formed a connection with Jack. \n\nCaroline's main issue seems to be that she didn't get what she wanted with Jack and took her frustration out on the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack and had no way of knowing that Caroline was using Paul as a ploy. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack during the trip.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't have malicious intent. They acted on their own feelings and the situation as it presented itself. Caroline's anger stems from her own failed attempt to reconnect with Jack, not from the author doing something inherently wrong. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's hidden agenda, so they couldn't have avoided it. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The real issue lies in Caroline's manipulation and her failure to be honest about her intentions. The answer should be B.\n"
