I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with a college friend, Caroline, to Germany. Caroline had a high school crush on Jack, a friend from her study abroad program. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and seems to ignore the author. Meanwhile, the author gets to know Jack and ends up sleeping with him. Caroline gets upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have realized that. She accuses the author of ruining the trip and being a \"slutty bitch.\" The author refuses to apologize and is now wondering if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline had a crush on Jack but was with Paul, the author ended up with Jack, and Caroline is upset about it. The author claims they didn't know about Caroline's crush and that Caroline's intentions were unclear. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. They spent time with Jack because Caroline was occupied with Paul. The author might think that since they didn't have a relationship with Jack, it's okay to date him, especially since Caroline was already with Paul. However, Caroline's argument is that she was trying to get Jack to notice her by being with Paul and that the author should have picked up on the fact that she liked Jack. \n\nBut wait, how could the author know that? The author mentions that Caroline was heavily into Paul and didn't pay attention to others. If Caroline was clearly with Paul, even if it was just to make Jack jealous, the author might not have had a way to know about the real intention. Also, Caroline took the author on the trip, which might have given the author a chance to interact with Jack, but if the author didn't know about the crush, it's not their fault. However, if Caroline's behavior was ambiguous or manipulative, the author could have been naive in assuming it was okay to start a relationship with someone who was part of Caroline's circle.\n\nAnother angle: the author and Jack developed a relationship while they were on the trip with Caroline. Whether this is problematic depends on the dynamics. If Caroline was using Paul to get to Jack, but the author didn't know, then the author isn't responsible for Caroline's manipulative behavior. However, if the author was aware that the group dynamic might be complicated and still chose to get involved with Jack, that could be a point against them. But the author claims they didn't know about the crush.\n\nAlso, the fact that Caroline is still angry and calling the author names might be more about her own actions (using Paul to get to Jack) and the author not knowing. The author might be in the right because they acted based on the information they had. Caroline's anger could stem from her own poor communication and planning the trip with a hidden agenda without being upfront.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was close to Caroline, maybe they should have noticed some hints about her feelings for Jack. But the author says Caroline was clearly with Paul, so unless there were other obvious signs, it's reasonable to assume Jack was available. The author might not be at fault here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they didn't know about Caroline's crush and acted on their own interactions with Jack. Caroline's behavior was deceptive in a way that put the author in a tough spot, but the author isn't responsible for her hidden intentions. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
