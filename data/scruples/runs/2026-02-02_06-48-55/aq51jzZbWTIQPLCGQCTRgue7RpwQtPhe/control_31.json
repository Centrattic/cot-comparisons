I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend of Caroline, the author, who went on a trip to Germany. Caroline invited them, and during the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack's (another person they met). The author ended up connecting with Jack, and they had a one-night stand. Caroline got angry because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have realized she was trying to make Jack jealous by being with Paul.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is a friend of Caroline's. Caroline was the one who arranged the meeting with Jack, since Paul didn't have a car and needed Jack to come along. The author and Jack spent time together, and eventually they hooked up. The problem is that Caroline had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known that her interest in Paul was a ploy to make Jack jealous.\n\nNow, considering consent and the dynamics. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. She was under the impression that Caroline was genuinely interested in Paul. The author and Jack were both adults, and they had a consensual relationship. Caroline's actions might have been manipulative\u2014using Paul to get back at Jack. But the author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. The author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author didn't know Caroline's feelings for Jack, then they can't be blamed for not knowing. However, Caroline's manipulation is her own problem, but the author's relationship with Jack might have affected Caroline's plans. The question is whether the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's possible hidden agenda. But there's no indication the author was aware or should have been aware. \n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction seems extreme. She invited the author on the trip, allowed them to meet Jack, and then became upset when the author connected with Jack. That seems contradictory. If Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous, then her anger at the author for hooking up with Jack might be misplaced. The author's actions were not against any explicit rules; Caroline didn't mention her feelings about Jack to the author beforehand. \n\nIn such situations, unless there were unspoken agreements or the author was aware of Caroline's feelings, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for manipulating her friend's trip to Germany for her own agenda. The author had no obligation to prevent Caroline's actions or to know her hidden motives unless there was a prior discussion. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The key points are that the author didn't have knowledge of Caroline's feelings, the relationship with Jack was consensual, and Caroline's behavior was manipulative and not communicated to the author.\n"
