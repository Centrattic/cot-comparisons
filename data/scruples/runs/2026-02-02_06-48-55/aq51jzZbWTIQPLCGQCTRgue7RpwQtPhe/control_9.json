I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had met someone named Jack during a previous summer program there. When they arrived, they met Jack and his friends. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, hooked up with him, and during that trip, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they ended up sleeping together. Now, Caroline is upset and wants an apology, but the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points here: Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school, planned the trip to check if Jack still had feelings, used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about this and had no way of knowing. The author's argument is that they couldn't have known Caroline's intentions, and they were getting to know Jack while Caroline was with Paul. Then, when they slept with Jack, Caroline got angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider factors like consent, knowledge, and intent. The author didn't know that Caroline had a crush on Jack, so they weren't intentionally messing with a friend's personal plans. However, Caroline was in her own relationship (with Paul) during the trip, which might complicate things. If Caroline was already with Paul, then sleeping with Jack could be a problem if the author knew she was in a relationship. But according to the scenario, the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack or her game of trying to make Jack jealous. Also, Caroline's actions with Paul might be questionable, as she was using him to manipulate Jack.\n\nThe author's point is that they couldn't have known Caroline's true intentions. In that case, the author isn't the one who was deceptive. But maybe there's a responsibility to be aware of a friend's emotional investments? Or is Caroline the one who set up these dynamics by using Paul and then getting upset when someone else connected with the guy she liked?\n\nAnother angle: Caroline's behavior might be more to blame here. She was actively pursuing Paul while trying to manipulate Jack, and the author was left alone with Jack. If the author was unaware of Caroline's plan, then sleeping with Jack isn't necessarily their fault. However, if the author noticed that Caroline was using Paul as a ploy and still went for Jack, that could be different. But the story says the author didn't know and thought they were just helping Caroline out with the trip.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame\u2014Caroline had a crush from 5 years ago. The author had no prior knowledge of that. So, unless there were clear signals that the author ignored, it's hard to see how the author is at fault. The main issue is Caroline's manipulation and her expectation that the author should have known her hidden agenda. The author seems to act without malice and without the necessary information to be at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's intentions and weren't deceptive themselves.\n"
