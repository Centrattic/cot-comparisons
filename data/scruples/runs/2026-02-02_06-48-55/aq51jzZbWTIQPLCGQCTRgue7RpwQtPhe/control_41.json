I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had met someone named Jack during a summer program in high school. On this trip, Caroline reconnects with Jack and also meets Paul. Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ignores the author, and ends up hooking up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author spends time with Jack and eventually ends up hooking up with him when Paul and Caroline are out. Caroline gets really angry because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She planned the trip to test if Jack still had feelings for her, and she's mad that the author slept with Jack instead of her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just invited along, met Jack through Caroline's friend Paul. It seems like Caroline was leading the author on by flirting with Paul and then getting mad because the author connected with Jack. \n\nThe author didn't know Caroline's plan. They were acting on their own feelings and the situation as it was presented. Caroline's actions were manipulative\u2014using Paul to get Jack's attention and then blaming the author for the outcome. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. \n\nIs the author at fault for sleeping with Jack? Probably not, since they weren't aware of Caroline's crush. The problem here is more about Caroline's manipulation and poor communication. The author was acting on their own agency, and the situation was set up in a way that led to this outcome. \n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction seems extreme. She's been demanding an apology for over a month, which is unreasonable. The author had no reason to know, so they can't be blamed for the outcome. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
