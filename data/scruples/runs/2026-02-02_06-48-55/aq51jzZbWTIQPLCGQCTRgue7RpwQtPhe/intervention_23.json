I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush, and during the trip, she started flirting with Paul. The author ended up getting close to Jack and they hooked up. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known to stay away from him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Caroline was the one who invited the author on the trip. Then she started hanging out with Paul, which the author noticed. The author got close to Jack while Caroline was with Paul. The key point is whether the author had any reason to know that Caroline still had feelings for Jack from high school. \n\nThe author argues that they couldn't have known and that Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul, ignoring others) made it seem like she wasn't interested in Jack. Caroline, on the other hand, claims she planned the trip to reconnect with Jack and thought the author would understand. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't deliberately set out to sabotage Caroline's plans with Jack. The author was just following their own experiences and interactions during the trip. Since there was no prior indication that Caroline was trying to get Jack back, the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, maybe the author should have noticed more or checked in with Caroline about her intentions. But Caroline didn't communicate her feelings clearly, and the author couldn't have known about her high school crush or her plan to see if Jack still liked her.\n\nAlso, the author and Jack were both acting on their own feelings during the trip. The author didn't know about Caroline's past connection with Jack. So in that sense, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that Caroline had feelings for Jack and avoided getting close to him. However, without clear signals, it's hard to say the author should have known. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't have reasonably known about Caroline's past crush and her plan. The answer would be B (No).\n"
