I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip with Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school days, and introduced the author to him. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's. She ended up hooking up with Paul, while the author spent time with Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. \n\nThe key points here are about consent, intentions, and boundaries. Caroline had a crush on Jack from 5 years ago and planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, which seems crucial. The author spent time getting close to Jack, leading to the hook-up. \n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether the author had any reason to know about Caroline's intentions with Jack. Since Caroline was actively with Paul, flirting with him, and ignoring others, it's unclear how the author could have known her true intentions. The author acted on their own feelings with Jack, who was not in a relationship at the time. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here: Caroline's manipulation. She was using Paul to get Jack's attention, which is a bit of a red flag. But the author isn't responsible for Caroline's decisions. If Jack was single and not in a relationship, then the author and Jack hooking up isn't inherently wrong. The problem lies in Caroline's own actions and her jealousy. \n\nThe author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack, so they can't be blamed for acting on their own attraction. The real fault might be with Caroline for using Paul as a jealousy tactic and then getting upset when Jack was with someone else. The author's refusal to apologize is justified because they had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't have the necessary information to know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, and they acted within their own boundaries without knowing about her plans.\n"
