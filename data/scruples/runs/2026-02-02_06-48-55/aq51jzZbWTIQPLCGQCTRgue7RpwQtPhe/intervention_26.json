I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was their college friend Caroline's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the context: Caroline and the author went to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush, and also met Paul. Caroline heavily flirted with Paul, hooked up with him, and then later got upset when the author slept with Jack. Caroline claims she was using Paul to make Jack jealous and that the trip was meant to see if Jack still liked her. The author didn't know about Caroline's plan and ended up with Jack.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they didn't know about Caroline's intentions. They were led to believe that Caroline was interested in Paul. The author spent time with Jack, who was friendly and open, and they formed a connection. The author didn't have any indication that Jack was off-limits because Caroline's actions suggested she was pursuing Paul.\n\nCaroline, on the other hand, orchestrated the trip to get close to Jack again. She used Paul as a distraction but then got upset when the author was with Jack. That seems like Caroline's own fault because she didn't communicate her intentions clearly. The author couldn't have known about her crush on Jack from five years ago, especially since she was actively pursuing Paul.\n\nThe key points here are consent and awareness. The author didn't know Jack was Caroline's intended target. Jack might have been aware of Caroline's history, but the author wasn't. Also, Caroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul and not clarifying her feelings towards Jack\u2014could have misled the author. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's behavior. However, Caroline was the one who was clearly flirting with Paul, not Jack. The author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. It's Caroline's lack of communication and her own manipulative planning that led to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships and friendships, clear communication is crucial. Caroline's failure to communicate her true intentions and her use of Paul to test Jack's feelings contribute to the misunderstanding. The author acted on the connection they had with Jack without prior knowledge of Caroline's hidden agenda. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The blame should lie more with Caroline for not being transparent and setting up a situation where her friend could be misled.\n"
