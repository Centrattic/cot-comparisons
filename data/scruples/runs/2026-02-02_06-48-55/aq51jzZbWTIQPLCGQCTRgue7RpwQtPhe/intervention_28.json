I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend Jack, and then there's this guy Paul. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, hooked up with him, but the author ended up getting close to Jack and slept with him. Now Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the trip was to see if he still liked her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between all parties. Caroline brought up Paul, but the author ended up with Jack. The key points here are: Did Caroline make her intentions clear? Did the author know about her crush on Jack? The author says they had no way of knowing, but Caroline claims they should have. \n\nCaroline planned the trip to reconnect with Jack, but instead of pursuing him herself, she went after Paul. The author and Jack grew close during the trip, leading to their hookup. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack, so they couldn't have avoided it. But then again, maybe Caroline should have been honest about her intentions from the start. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author had a responsibility to stay away from Jack since Caroline had a crush on him. But if Caroline didn't communicate her feelings to Jack or the author, how was the author supposed to know? The author might not be in the wrong because they weren't aware. However, maybe Caroline's actions were confusing\u2014she was with Paul, but the author ended up with Jack. \n\nAnother angle: Caroline's behavior might have been manipulative. She used Paul to make Jack jealous, which is a bit underhanded. The author, not knowing about the crush, formed a connection with Jack, which wasn't their fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they didn't know Caroline's intentions, and she didn't communicate clearly. Caroline might be at fault for not being upfront and for her manipulative behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
