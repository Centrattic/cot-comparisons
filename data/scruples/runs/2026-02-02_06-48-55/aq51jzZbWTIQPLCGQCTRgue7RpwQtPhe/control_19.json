I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author went on a trip to Germany with Caroline, their college friend. On the trip, Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school time in Germany. She starts flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ends up getting close to Jack and they sleep together. Caroline gets really upset, claims she had a crush on Jack and was trying to make him jealous by being with Paul. She's angry that the author didn't realize her feelings were for Jack and instead slept with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider different angles.\n\nFrom Caroline's perspective: She went on the trip planning to reconnect with Jack to see if he still had feelings for her. She was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She might feel that the author was supposed to notice her interest in Jack and not get involved. She's upset that the author didn't pick up on her signals and that the author slept with Jack instead.\n\nFrom the author's side: They didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were invited on the trip, met Jack through Caroline's friend Paul, and developed a relationship with Jack during the trip. The author didn't have any indication of Caroline's true intentions and acted on their own feelings with Jack. They didn't know that Caroline was using Paul to get Jack's attention, so they might not be at fault for not reading between the lines.\n\nMoral and social considerations: Did the author have any reason to believe that Jack was off-limits? Caroline was the one who introduced them to Jack's circle. If Caroline wasn't transparent about her feelings for Jack, then maybe she's responsible for not making that clear. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's plans and might not be in the wrong for forming a connection with Jack while he was single.\n\nAlso, Caroline's actions: She was the one who was actively pursuing Paul, ignoring the author, and then later acting like she was interested in Jack. Her behavior could be seen as deceptive. The author sleeping with Jack might not be wrong if Jack was single and not in a relationship at the time.\n\nBut wait, did Jack know about Caroline's feelings? If Jack was aware and still pursued a relationship with the author, then maybe the author isn't at fault. But if Caroline was leading Jack on by being with Paul, and then Jack chose the author over her, that complicates things. However, the author isn't responsible for Jack's choices.\n\nAnother point: The author was a friend of Caroline's and ended up sleeping with someone who was emotionally connected to their friend. But since Caroline's feelings for Jack were not clear to the author, and Jack was available, maybe the author isn't at fault. The key is whether the author had any reason to know about Caroline's feelings towards Jack. If Caroline didn't make that clear, the author can't be blamed for not knowing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. Caroline's actions were deceptive, and the author acted on their own connection with Jack without prior knowledge. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
