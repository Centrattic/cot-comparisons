I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, and during the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, then ended up with him. Meanwhile, the author got close to Jack and ended up hooking up with him when Caroline and Paul were out. Now, Caroline is upset and thinks the author is in the wrong because she had a crush on Jack back in high school and thought the author should have known that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just friends, and Caroline's actions with Paul seemed genuine to the author. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline was using Paul to get back at Jack or that she was trying to reconnect with Jack through the trip. The author and Jack formed a connection during the trip, which led to them hooking up. \n\nCaroline's main argument is that the author should have been able to tell she was into Jack, not Paul. But realistically, how would the author know that? The author was just a friend, and Caroline's actions with Paul seemed real at the time. The author didn't have any prior knowledge about Caroline's feelings towards Jack from high school. \n\nAlso, Caroline planned the trip partly to see if Jack still had feelings for her. The author wasn't part of that plan, so they couldn't be expected to read Caroline's mind or know her intentions. The author's actions with Jack were consensual and based on their own connection, not knowing about Caroline's past crush. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more aware of Caroline's signals, but the story says that Caroline was actively with Paul and ignoring others, which might have led the author to believe that Paul was her main interest. The author wasn't trying to interfere with Caroline's plans, especially since those plans were secret. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't have the information to know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They acted on their own connection with Jack, which was consensual. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her intentions clearly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
