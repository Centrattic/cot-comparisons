I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and Caroline went on a trip to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school days. She introduced the author to Jack's group, but then started heavily flirting with Paul, another friend. They ended up hooking up on the first night. Over the next days, Caroline kept seeing Paul, while the author bonded with Jack. On the last night, the author and Jack had sex. The next morning, Caroline was furious, claiming she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to make him jealous. She's been upset ever since, and the author refuses to apologize.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is a friend of Caroline, and during a trip she invited them to. Caroline made a play for Paul, but then got mad when the author ended up with Jack. The author's defense is that they had no way of knowing Caroline's deeper intentions with Paul. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider the facts. Caroline's actions: She went on the trip with the intent to reconnect with Jack, used Paul as a distraction to get Jack's attention, and then expected the author to not get involved with Jack. The author, on the other hand, didn't know about Caroline's plan. They were trying to have a good time and ended up with Jack, who was available and interested. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't know Caroline's hidden agenda. They were led to believe that Paul was the target. The author's relationship with Caroline was a friendship, so they didn't have a responsibility to protect her feelings about Jack. Caroline's actions were manipulative by using Paul to manipulate Jack's attention. The author's actions were based on available information and their own experiences during the trip. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been aware that Jack was a potential interest for Caroline, given their past. But Caroline didn't communicate her intentions clearly. The author's lack of knowledge is key here. Since they didn't know, they can't be blamed for acting on what they believed was the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't have known about Caroline's intentions, and Caroline's manipulative behavior led to the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
