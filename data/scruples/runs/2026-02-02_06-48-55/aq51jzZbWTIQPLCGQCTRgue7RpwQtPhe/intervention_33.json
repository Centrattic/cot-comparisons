I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nSo the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with someone named Jack, a friend from her high school exchange program. The author met Jack and ended up hooking up with him after Caroline was busy with Paul. Caroline then flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her. She accused the author of being a slut and ruined the trip.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. Caroline introduced the author to Jack. She was with Paul, but the author ended up spending time with Jack and they developed a relationship. The key point is whether the author had any indication that Caroline was trying to rekindle her crush on Jack. The author claims they didn't know, and Caroline never communicated her intentions. \n\nCaroline planned the trip to Germany, which seems like a big effort just to see Jack. However, she was with Paul the entire trip, which might have confused the author. The author didn't know about her crush on Jack at the time. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a situation where Jack was available, they spent time together, and they ended up hooking up. The author didn't have prior knowledge about Caroline's feelings towards Jack. Caroline's frustration comes from the author not recognizing her hidden agenda, which the author couldn't have known.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions, especially since she was very focused on Paul and maybe gave mixed signals. But the author was just trying to have their own experience during the trip. \n\nAnother angle: Caroline's actions of planning the trip to Germany specifically to check on Jack might be seen as manipulative. She didn't clarify her intentions to the author, leading to a misunderstanding. The author acted on their own feelings without knowing about Caroline's past crush. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be at fault because they couldn't have known Caroline's hidden motives. However, if Caroline felt that the author should have been able to read her mind or understand her intentions without explicit communication, that could be a point against the author. But generally, people are expected to communicate their intentions, especially in situations like this.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information they had at the time and didn't have any reason to suspect Caroline's feelings towards Jack. Caroline's lack of communication is a bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B for No.\n"
