I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, the setup: Caroline invited the author on a trip to Germany. They met Jack, Caroline's friend. Caroline started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they had a one-time hook-up. Caroline found out and got really angry, accusing the author of ruining the trip and being a \"slut.\" The author refuses to apologize.\n\nNow, considering the details. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school, went to Germany to see him again, and used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author had no way of knowing about Caroline's crush or her intentions. They formed a connection with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. The key point here is consent and knowledge. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings towards Jack. They were just socializing and ended up in a situation that both parties (Jack and the author) were into. \n\nCaroline's actions also need to be considered. She was the one who brought the author to meet Jack's group, and she was actively involved with Paul. The author wasn't aware of her plan to reconnect with Jack. So, the author didn't intentionally sabotage anything. \n\nIs the author at fault? Probably not. They made a mistake in not knowing Caroline's feelings, but they had no reason to know. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions. The author's actions were based on the information they had at the time, which didn't indicate any off-limits boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
