I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. Caroline had a high school crush on Jack, who she met during a summer program. She reconnects with Jack on this trip and starts heavily flirting with Paul, another friend, while the author ends up spending time with Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hook up, leading to Caroline being really upset.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just going along with the plan to meet Jack's friends. When Caroline started flirting with Paul, the author didn't intervene because they didn't realize Jack was her crush. The author and Jack ended up getting close and having a relationship, but Caroline is mad because she thought the author should have known her true feelings were for Jack, not Paul.\n\nHmm, Caroline's actions here are a bit confusing. She invited the author on a trip to meet Jack, then focused on Paul. The author was just following the plan and didn't have any indication that Jack was her actual target. It's not like the author was trying to sabotage her plans or knew about the crush beforehand. Caroline's plan to make Jack jealous by hooking up with Paul seems manipulative, which might be on her. But the author ended up with Jack, so maybe they didn't do anything wrong because they were unaware.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if it's considered that they had a close relationship with Caroline, so they should have been able to tell she was interested in Jack. But how? Caroline was actively flirting with Paul, not Jack. The author might not have had any reason to suspect her true feelings were for Jack instead. Plus, they were just spending time with Jack because Paul didn't have a car and Caroline wasn't paying attention to them. \n\nCaroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her feelings. The author didn't know Paul was just a means to an end for her. If the author had known, maybe they would have acted differently. But since they didn't, and they formed a connection with Jack naturally, maybe they're not at fault. The fact that Caroline planned a trip just to check on her high school crush and didn't tell the author might make her the one in the wrong. The author's refusal to apologize makes sense because they didn't do anything knowingly. So, the answer is B, no.\n"
