I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a college friend, Caroline, inviting the author to Germany, where they meet Jack. Caroline starts flirting with Paul, ends up with him, and the author ends up forming a close bond with Jack, eventually sleeping with him. Caroline gets angry because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known she wanted him instead of Paul.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They went on a trip with a friend, met Jack, and ended up sleeping with him. But the key points are whether the author knew about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author claims no knowledge, stating they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. Caroline, however, claims she planned the trip to reconnect with Jack and that the author should have realized her feelings.\n\nThe question is about the author's responsibility. If the author genuinely didn't know about Caroline's crush and Jack's role, then they might not be at fault. However, if there were clear signals that the author ignored or dismissed, that could be a different story. The scenario mentions that Caroline was heavily into Paul, so there's no direct indication that the author knew about her crush on Jack until after the fact when Caroline revealed it.\n\nAlso, Caroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul and hooking up with him\u2014could be seen as her own choices. The author's connection with Jack was during the trip, which might be a natural development if they spent time together. However, the author might be in the wrong if they were aware of Caroline's history with Jack and still pursued him, but the story says the author didn't know.\n\nCaroline's anger stems from feeling that the author didn't support her by staying away from Jack, but the author couldn't have known. The author's refusal to apologize is based on lack of knowledge. So, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe the fact that they slept with Jack during the same trip where Caroline was present could be a factor. But without explicit knowledge, it's hard to hold the author responsible. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't know Caroline's hidden agenda.\n"
