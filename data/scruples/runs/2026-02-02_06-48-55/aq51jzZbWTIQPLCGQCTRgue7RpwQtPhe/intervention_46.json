I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The summary is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend Jack from her high school days and introduced them. Caroline then started flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. The author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually they hooked up as well. The next day, Caroline got angry, accused the author of ruining the trip, and the author refuses to apologize.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Caroline had a history with Jack from high school. She planned the trip to Germany, which might have been a red flag. She used Paul to possibly make Jack jealous. The author, not knowing about Caroline's feelings towards Jack, formed a connection with Jack. \n\nThe key points here are consent and intentions. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline's actions were deceptive because she was using Paul to get to Jack. The author acted on their feelings with Jack without knowing Caroline's secret motives. \n\nCaroline's main issue is that she thought the author should have known her true intentions. But how could the author have known? Caroline didn't communicate that she wanted to get back with Jack. She was actively pursuing Paul, which might have been a cover. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip. \n\nFrom a friendship standpoint, Caroline's deception is a problem. She led the author into a situation where she was trying to manipulate Jack's feelings through Paul, and then got angry when the author connected with Jack. The author isn't at fault here because they had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything to interfere with Caroline's relationship with Paul. The author's relationship with Jack was a result of their own interactions, not Caroline's manipulation. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she was the one who was using her friend as a pawn in her own game. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong. They acted on their own feelings without prior knowledge of Caroline's intentions, and Caroline's actions were deceptive and led to her own disappointment. The answer would be B.\n"
