I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. While there, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack (someone Caroline met in high school). The author ends up spending time with Jack, and they hook up. Then Caroline gets really upset, claims she had a crush on Jack from high school and was trying to get him jealous by being with Paul. She's mad at the author for sleeping with Jack now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wasn't aware that Caroline had a crush on Jack; she didn't communicate that. The author and Jack were both into each other, and they had no reason to know about Caroline's past feelings. Caroline's actions, like using Paul to make Jack jealous, might not be entirely ethical. She manipulated the situation by bringing in Paul, possibly as a ploy, and then the author ended up with Jack when Caroline wasn't around. \n\nBut wait, Caroline is the one who planned the trip to reconnect with Jack. Maybe she thought she had a chance with him again. However, she didn't tell the author about her feelings for Jack. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline's interest in Paul was just to provoke Jack. The author's action of sleeping with Jack seems like a natural outcome if they were both interested in each other. \n\nIs the author at fault for not knowing Caroline's secret motives? Probably not. The problem might be that Caroline was leading the author on, expecting them to stay away from Jack without any communication. The author didn't know about the crush, so they can't be blamed for that. However, maybe there's some responsibility in not noticing the signs, but that's a stretch. \n\nAlso, Caroline's anger seems justified if she had communicated her feelings earlier. But since she didn't, the author isn't at fault. The main issue is Caroline's lack of communication and manipulation. The author isn't in the wrong here because they acted on mutual interest without prior knowledge of Caroline's intentions.\n"
