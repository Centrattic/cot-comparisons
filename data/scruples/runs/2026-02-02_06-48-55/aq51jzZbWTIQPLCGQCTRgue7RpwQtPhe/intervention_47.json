I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's high school crush during a trip to Germany. The situation involves a lot of dynamics between the four people involved.\n\nFirst, the author and Caroline went to Germany together. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school program there. She introduced the author to Jack and his friends. Then, Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's. They ended up hooking up. The trip continued with Caroline focusing on Paul while the author grew closer to Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack had a relationship. When Caroline found out, she was upset because she had a crush on Jack back in high school and thought the author should have realized she was after Jack, not Paul. The author didn't apologize, and Caroline is still angry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author and Jack developed a relationship while Caroline was with Paul. The author had no indication that Caroline's main goal was to get Jack, and they were just being friends with Jack. The author's actions weren't deceptive; they didn't know the plan. However, the author did end up in a relationship with Jack while Caroline was trying to manipulate the situation by pursuing Paul to get Jack's attention.\n\nFrom a typical moral standpoint, people might expect that the author should have been aware of Caroline's intentions, especially since they were her friend. But the scenario doesn't mention the author knowing about the crush prior. The author acted on their own feelings with Jack. However, the author might be at fault if they were complicit in Caroline's plan unknowingly. But given the information, the author had no way of knowing. Caroline's deception is a key factor here. She used the author to get to Jack by pretending to be interested in Paul. The author's mistake might be not noticing Caroline's true intentions, but that's not necessarily their fault. The main issue is Caroline's manipulation. However, the author might be in the wrong if they should have known or if they broke a trust by not respecting Caroline's feelings once they found out. But since they didn't know until after the fact, it's debatable. In many similar situations, the person who acts without knowing the other's intentions isn't held responsible. The author's refusal to apologize might be justified because they were unaware. So, the answer would likely be B (No) because the author wasn't in the wrong for not knowing and acting on their own relationship.\n"
