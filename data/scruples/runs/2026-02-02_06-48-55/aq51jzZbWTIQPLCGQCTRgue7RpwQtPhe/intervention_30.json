I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with her old friend Jack from when she studied there in high school. Then Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. The user ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. Now Caroline is upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to win him back, and is mad that the user didn't realize and slept with Jack instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is a friend of Caroline's, and Caroline invited them on the trip. The user met Jack, who was part of the group that Caroline reconnected with. Caroline's actions of flirting with Paul and then being upset about the user sleeping with Jack are a bit confusing. The user didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack back then. Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous seems manipulative. The user had no way of knowing that Caroline was after Jack, so sleeping with Jack could be seen as a genuine connection. \n\nBut wait, was the user aware of Caroline's intentions at all? The user mentions that Caroline was ignoring others and focused on Paul. The user ended up bonding with Jack, not knowing about Caroline's past feelings. Caroline's anger seems to stem from the fact that the user didn't realize her plan to use Paul as a way to get to Jack. The user's refusal to apologize is because they had no way of knowing, and they felt Caroline's plan was creepy. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the user didn't have malicious intent. They were genuinely connecting with someone they met during the trip. Caroline's actions of using Paul to compete with Jack might be the root of the problem here. The user isn't in the wrong for not knowing Caroline's secret intentions. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
