I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. So, the scenario is that Caroline, the college friend, invited the author on a trip to Germany. While there, Caroline started flirting with Paul, and then later, the author ended up hooking up with Jack, who was someone Caroline had a crush on from high school. Caroline was upset because she thought the trip was to reconnect with Jack, and she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and ended up with Jack, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author had a reasonable way of knowing about Caroline's feelings for Jack. Caroline planned the trip to Germany, which the author might have thought was for reconnection with friends, including Jack. However, Caroline kept her feelings for Jack a secret from the author. The author had no prior knowledge that Caroline had a crush on Jack, so they couldn't have known that their actions would hurt Caroline.\n\nAnother angle is consent and boundaries. The author was on a trip with friends, and while they were interested in Jack, they didn't know Caroline had a history with him. Caroline's actions, like using Paul to make Jack jealous, were her own manipulations. The author didn't interfere with Caroline's plans to reconnect with Jack because she didn't know about it. The author's decision to pursue a relationship with Jack was based on their own feelings and the opportunities presented during the trip.\n\nIt's also important to note that Caroline's behavior might have been problematic. She didn't communicate her intentions clearly. If she had made it known that she still had feelings for Jack, the author might have approached the situation differently. However, since she didn't, the author couldn't be expected to read her mind or know about her past crush.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't intentionally sabotage Caroline's chances with Jack. They formed a connection with Jack naturally during the trip, and the hooking up was a result of mutual interest. Caroline's anger seems to stem from the fact that the author took an action she didn't expect, but the author was unaware of her motivations.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author was a guest in the situation and acted based on the information available. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions. The author isn't at fault for not knowing something that wasn't communicated to them.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. They had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden agenda with the trip and Jack, and their actions were based on the circumstances they were presented with.\n"
