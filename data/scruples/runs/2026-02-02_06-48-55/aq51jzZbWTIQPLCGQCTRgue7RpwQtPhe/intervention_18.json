I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The writer went on a trip to Germany with their college friend, Caroline. They met Jack, a friend of Caroline's from her high school exchange program. Caroline started flirting with Paul and ended up hooking up with him, while the writer got close to Jack. Eventually, the writer and Jack hooked up during the trip. When they told Caroline, she got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and that she had planned the trip to rekindle that. She accused the writer of \"stealing\" Jack from her. The writer refuses to apologize, thinking Caroline's expectations were unreasonable. Now Caroline is still upset, and the writer is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the writer have a right to pursue a relationship with Jack, considering Caroline's unspoken intentions? Was Caroline's behavior manipulative or deceptive? \n\nFrom what's written, Caroline's actions during the trip seem to be focused on Paul. She was actively flirting with him and ended up with him. However, she later claims she was only using Paul to make Jack jealous. But during the trip, the writer and Jack grew closer and had a relationship. The writer claims they had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions with Jack, especially since Caroline was openly with Paul. \n\nCaroline's plan to use Paul as a way to get Jack's attention seems manipulative. She might have been leading the writer on, using them as a way to get to Jack. However, the writer didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and acted based on their own feelings and the situation presented. The writer had no reason to suspect Caroline's ulterior motives because she was with Paul. \n\nThe key here is whether the writer had a reasonable expectation of privacy or autonomy in forming a relationship with Jack. Since Caroline's intentions towards Jack were not communicated, the writer couldn't have known. It's possible that Caroline's behavior was manipulative, leading the writer into a situation where they were used as a pawn in her game. However, the writer also engaged in a relationship with Jack without being aware of Caroline's past feelings, which might not be the writer's fault if Caroline didn't make her intentions clear.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the writer should have been more aware of the dynamic. But given that Caroline was openly with Paul during the trip, the writer didn't have a reason to think Jack was off-limits. The writer's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not on Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nSo, considering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong. Caroline's actions involved a level of manipulation by not being honest about her feelings for Jack, leading the writer into a situation where they were used as a means to an end. The writer had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions and acted based on the information available. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
