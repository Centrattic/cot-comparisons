I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was their friend Caroline's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the key points: Caroline invited the author to Germany. There, Caroline met up with Jack, her old high school crush, and started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's. Caroline ended up hooking up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and they got close. After Caroline and Paul's hook-up, the author and Jack ended up sleeping together. Later, Caroline got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to rekindle it, using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's been upset, demanding an apology.\n\nNow, considering the facts: The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline was the one who introduced them, and it was her who was actively pursuing Paul. The author had no reason to know that Caroline's attention was intended for Jack. Caroline's actions, like hooking up with Paul while the author was with Jack, might even suggest she was trying to manipulate the situation. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the information available to them. Since Caroline didn't communicate her true intentions, the author isn't responsible for assuming hidden motives. The real issue here is Caroline's dishonesty and her using the author's presence to manipulate Jack. The author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the knowledge to prevent the situation, and Caroline's claims about planning the trip to win Jack over are her own choices. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
