I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's high school crush. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline had a high school crush on Jack and had studied in Germany where she met him. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, another friend, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spends time with Jack and eventually sleeps with him. Caroline gets angry and accuses the author of being a slut, among other things, because she thought the trip was to rekindle her crush on Jack, not for the author to end up with him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline had a crush on Jack, went on the trip with the intent to see if Jack still had feelings, and used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author, unaware of Caroline's intentions, developed a connection with Jack and they slept together. Now Caroline is upset and wants an apology.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't know about Caroline's crush and her plan. The author was in a situation where they were spending time with Jack, possibly encouraged by Caroline's own actions (since she was with Paul). The author didn't know that Caroline had a claim on Jack. So the author didn't act with malice or intent to hurt Caroline. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip and the interactions they had, which were not made clear by Caroline.\n\nCaroline, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for not being honest about her intentions. She planned the trip to pursue her crush on Jack but then acted in a way that made the author believe she was interested in Paul. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her intentions clearly, and the author acted without knowledge of her feelings towards Jack.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
