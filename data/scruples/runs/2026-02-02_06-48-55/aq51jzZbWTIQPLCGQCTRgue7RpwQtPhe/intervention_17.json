I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who slept with Jack) is in the wrong. The situation involves a college friend, Caroline, who had a high school crush on Jack and invited the author on a trip to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and seems to ignore the author. Meanwhile, the author gets close to Jack and eventually sleeps with him. Caroline gets angry and is still upset a month later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack 5 years ago and went on a trip to Germany partly to see if Jack still felt the same. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings towards Jack and had a relationship with him instead. The main issue here is whether the author had a duty to know or avoid this situation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just following the social interactions during the trip. Caroline's actions with Paul seemed to indicate she wasn't interested in Jack at the time, so the author had no reason to suspect otherwise. The author might have thought they were free to connect with Jack since Caroline was preoccupied with Paul.\n\nHowever, Caroline's perspective is that she planned the trip with the intent to reconnect with Jack and use Paul as a strategy. She might feel that the author didn't support her plan and instead took advantage of the situation. But since the author wasn't aware of Caroline's intentions, they couldn't have avoided it. \n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings or her plan. The fault might lie more with Caroline for not being clear about her intentions. The author acted based on the information available to them at the time. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
