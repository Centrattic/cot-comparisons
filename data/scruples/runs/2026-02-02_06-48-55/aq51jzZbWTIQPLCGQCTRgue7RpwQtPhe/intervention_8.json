I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's high school crush. Let me look at the situation again.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnects with Jack, her high school friend, and introduces the author to Jack and his friends. Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, another friend, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author is spending time with Jack and eventually they sleep together. When Caroline finds out, she's furious because she had a crush on Jack and was trying to get him to notice her by getting close to Paul. She planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings for her. The author refuses to apologize, and now Caroline is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had any reason to know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. The story says Caroline was openly flirting with Paul and ignored the author. The author had no indication that Caroline was interested in Jack. The author and Jack got close because Caroline was busy with Paul. It's possible the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack because she didn't mention it. \n\nCaroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul and ignoring the author\u2014might have given the impression that she wasn't interested in Jack. Also, Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous wasn't communicated to the author. The author couldn't have known that Caroline had a crush on Jack and was using Paul as a tactic. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a situation where they formed a connection with Jack, who was available and engaging. The author didn't know about Caroline's hidden agenda. The problem is that Caroline didn't communicate her feelings or intentions to the author, leading to a misunderstanding. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they should have been aware of Caroline's feelings. But given that Caroline was actively avoiding the author and focusing on Paul, it's reasonable that the author didn't pick up on her unspoken feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered that Jack was someone Caroline had a history with, even if not explicit. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author knew Jack was a crush. Caroline didn't mention it until after the fact. \n\nIn such situations, the key is whether the author had reason to know. Since they didn't, it's hard to hold them responsible. The main fault here might lie with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for trying to manipulate the situation without transparency. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's secret feelings and there was no indication that Jack was off-limits.\n"
