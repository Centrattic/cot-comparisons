I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush from five years ago. Then she started flirting heavily with Paul, Jack's friend, and ended up hooking up with him while the author was with Jack. Over the 10 days, Caroline kept meeting Paul, but the author ended up getting close to Jack and they had sex. Caroline flipped out, saying the author ruined the trip and made her jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social boundaries here. Caroline planned the trip with the author, but she was also trying to reconnect with Jack. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and didn't realize she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author's relationship with Jack developed during the trip, and they both felt close. \n\nIs the author at fault for not knowing Caroline's intentions? Probably not. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline had a crush on Jack and was using Paul as a strategy. The author was just being social and forming a connection with someone they met during the trip. \n\nOn the other hand, Caroline might have been manipulative by leading the author into a situation where her own crush was involved. But the author didn't know that. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip. \n\nCaroline's reaction seems extreme. She planned the trip with the author and then got upset when the author formed a relationship with someone else. It's possible that Caroline felt betrayed, but the author didn't know about the crush. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything deceitful. They didn't know Jack was Caroline's crush, so their actions were innocent. The problem seems to be that Caroline had a hidden motive that the author wasn't aware of. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they had no knowledge of Caroline's intentions towards Jack. The fault might lie more with Caroline for not being upfront and using her friend in a manipulative way. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
