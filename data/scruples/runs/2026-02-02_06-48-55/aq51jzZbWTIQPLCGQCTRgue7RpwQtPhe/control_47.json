I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with her friend Jack from when she studied there in high school. They met a group of friends, including Paul. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul and ended up hooking up with him, while the author and Jack spent time together. Eventually, the author and Jack hooked up. When Caroline found out, she was really upset because she had a crush on Jack from five years ago and thought the author should have known she was trying to get Jack jealous by being with Paul. The author didn't apologize and now Caroline is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the author knew. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline was the one who was all over Paul. The author and Jack connected during the trip, leading to them hooking up. The author's actions were based on the assumption that Caroline was interested in Paul, not Jack. The key point here is whether the author had any reason to know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. Since Caroline was actively with Paul and not hinting about her feelings for Jack, the author couldn't have known. \n\nCaroline's actions might have been misleading. She planned the trip to reconnect with Jack, but instead of being open about her feelings, she tried to provoke Jack through Paul. The author, as a friend, had no way of discerning this hidden agenda. The author's relationship with Jack developed naturally during the trip, and the hook-up was between two people who were both supposedly just getting to know each other while Caroline was busy with Paul. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, there's no indication they acted in bad faith. They were in the same situation as Jack, who was part of the group. The blame here seems to lie with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for manipulating the situation. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden motives and past feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
