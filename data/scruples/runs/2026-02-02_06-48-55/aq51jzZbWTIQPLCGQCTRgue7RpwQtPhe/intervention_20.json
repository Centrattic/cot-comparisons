I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with her friend Jack, and they met Jack's friend Paul. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, hooked up with him, and then spent most of the trip with Paul while the author got to know Jack. Eventually, the author ended up hooking up with Jack. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have known she was trying to make Jack jealous by being with Paul. Now, Caroline is mad and wants an apology.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is a friend of Caroline, and they went on a trip together. Caroline's behavior seems to be the main issue here. She's trying to reconnect with Paul, spends most of the trip with him, and then later claims she was trying to get Jack jealous. The author, while spending time with Jack, developed a relationship with him, not knowing about Caroline's crush. \n\nSo, the question is: is the author at fault for sleeping with Jack? Let's consider the perspectives. From the author's side, they had no idea that Caroline had a crush on Jack. They were just getting to know Jack, and Caroline's behavior was towards Paul. The author didn't know about the crush and was acting on their own feelings. On the other hand, Caroline might feel that the author should have been more perceptive or that the author took advantage of the situation.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't know about Caroline's crush. The story mentions that Caroline didn't communicate her intentions. The author can't be expected to read her mind. If Caroline was trying to make Jack jealous by being with Paul, but the author was unaware, then it's not the author's fault. However, maybe the author should have considered if Jack was taken or if there was some history there. But the author had no reason to suspect that because Caroline didn't mention it. \n\nAnother angle: Caroline planned the trip to reconnect with Jack. She didn't tell the author about her crush, so the author didn't know. So, the author's actions were based on the information they had, which was that Jack was a friend of Caroline's, and Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't know about the crush, so they weren't intentionally trying to undermine Caroline's plans. \n\nBut maybe the author could have noticed the signs? However, the story says that Caroline was with Paul and ignoring others. The author was with Jack, and they developed a connection. It's possible that the author didn't have any reason to think Jack was off-limits because Caroline didn't communicate that. \n\nAnother point: Caroline is now mad because she thought the author should have known. But it's not the author's responsibility to guess Caroline's intentions. Relationships and crushes aren't common knowledge unless communicated. So, the author isn't at fault for not knowing. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more considerate of Caroline's feelings. But again, the author didn't have that information. It's a bit of a classic \"miscommunication\" scenario. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author had no knowledge of Caroline's crush and was acting on their own experiences during the trip, they aren't in the wrong. Caroline's actions (not communicating her intentions) and her manipulation by getting with Paul to make Jack jealous are the root of the problem. The author isn't responsible for that.\n"
