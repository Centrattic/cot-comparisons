I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with a friend Jack and introduced the author to Jack's friend Paul. Caroline ended up hooking up with Paul, but during the trip, she also saw Jack, who she had a crush on from high school. The author, meanwhile, got close to Jack and ended up sleeping with him. When they told Caroline, she was upset because she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's now angry and demanding an apology.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Did the author know about Caroline's crush on Jack beforehand? The story says Caroline planned the trip to Germany to see if Jack still felt something for her. But the author didn't know this until after the fact. The author assumed Caroline was interested in Paul. The author also didn't know that Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were just getting to know Jack during the trip and developed a mutual attraction. The problem here might hinge on whether the author had any prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings towards Jack. Since the author didn't know, they couldn't have intentionally interfered. However, if Caroline had a history of making plans with the intention of rekindling the crush, but didn't communicate that to the author, then the author might be in a tricky spot where they were unaware of the context.\n\nAnother angle is whether Caroline's actions were deceptive. She led the author to believe she was interested in Paul, which might have given the author the impression that Jack was available. If the author had no reason to suspect that Caroline was interested in Jack, then sleeping with Jack might not be their fault. However, if Caroline's behavior towards Paul was a ruse to get closer to Jack, maybe the author should have been more cautious. But how could they have known? The author wasn't part of Caroline's internal motivations.\n\nAlso, considering friendship. If Caroline considered the author a good friend, she might have expected some discretion about her feelings for Jack. But the author didn't know those feelings existed at the time. So, is the author to blame for not reading Caroline's mind? Probably not. The author acted on their own connection with Jack, who was present during the trip and available. \n\nOn the other hand, Caroline's approach of using Paul to make Jack jealous could be seen as manipulative. She might have set up a situation where she could pursue Jack while the author was under the impression that Paul was the target. If that's the case, Caroline's actions might be more in the wrong. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, unless there was a prior agreement or knowledge that Jack was off-limits, the author didn't do anything wrong by forming a relationship with someone they genuinely connected with. The key here is the lack of prior knowledge. The author couldn't have known about Caroline's intentions, so they can't be blamed for acting on their own attraction to Jack. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were unaware of Caroline's crush and the trip's purpose. The responsibility might lie more with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions and for leading the author into a situation where they could unknowingly interfere. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
