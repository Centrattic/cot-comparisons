I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's friend, Caroline, had a crush on Jack from high school and planned a trip to Germany partly to see if he still felt the same. She then started hooking up with Paul to make Jack jealous. The author, the person in question, ended up getting close to Jack and they had sex. Caroline flipped out and is still angry.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. First, Caroline had a crush on Jack and used Paul as a way to get to Jack. The author didn't know about Caroline's plan and had no way of knowing Jack was her target. The author was just participating in the trip as a friend and ended up forming a connection with Jack, which led to the sexual encounter.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't have malicious intent. They were likely unaware of Caroline's manipulative tactics. The author's actions were based on their own feelings and the situation as it presented itself during the trip. Since there was no prior knowledge of Caroline's plan, the author can't be blamed for not knowing. Additionally, Caroline's plan involved using Paul to manipulate Jack's emotions, which is perhaps more problematic.\n\nHowever, there's a part where the author had sex with Jack while Caroline was with Paul, and they might have been aware of Caroline's intentions but chose to ignore them. But according to the story, the author didn't know until after the fact. So the author's main fault, if any, is not recognizing Caroline's intentions, but since that's not something they could have reasonably known, it's not their fault.\n\nCaroline's actions are more concerning because she manipulated the situation to get what she wanted. The author was an innocent participant in the dynamics that Caroline set up. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
