I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, the high school crush of their friend Caroline. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author to Germany. Then, Caroline met up with Jack and his friends. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, hooked up with him, and during the trip, Caroline was using Paul to get close to Jack. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they slept together. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack back in high school and thought the author should have realized she liked Jack instead of Paul. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to sleep with Jack. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school, but she didn't communicate that clearly. Instead, she was with Paul, which might have been a way to get attention from Jack. The author had no way of knowing about Caroline's feelings towards Jack, since she was actively pursuing Paul. Jack and the author got close because Caroline was otherwise engaged. \n\nThe author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline didn't make it clear that she liked Jack, and instead was with Paul. So the author's actions were based on what was happening in front of them. The problem arises because Caroline later claims the author should have known, but there's no indication she gave any signals pointing to Jack. The author and Jack developed a connection independently. \n\nCaroline's behavior of trying to manipulate the situation to get Jack's attention seems problematic. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's intentions. So, in this scenario, the author probably isn't at fault. The answer is B (No).\n"
