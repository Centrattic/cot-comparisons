I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, let's outline the key points. The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with and then hooked up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, Caroline's high school crush. Eventually, the author and Jack slept together. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have realized she was interested in Jack instead of Paul. The author didn't apologize, but Caroline is still upset and wants an apology.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the context. Caroline's intentions were to reconnect with Jack during the trip, trying to get Paul to make Jack jealous. The author had no prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings for Jack. They were invited to the trip, met Jack, and developed a connection. The author and Jack's relationship started while Caroline was with Paul. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's important to know if the author had any prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings for Jack. If not, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the author should have known or noticed Caroline's intentions, that could be a point of contention. But in the story, the author mentions that Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul and ignored others, which might have led the author to believe that Caroline wasn't interested in Jack. \n\nAnother angle is whether Caroline's actions were misleading. She planned the trip with the intention to see Jack and use Paul to make him jealous. If she didn't communicate this to the author, then she might have set up a situation that led to the misunderstanding. The author had no way of knowing that Jack was her actual target. \n\nIn relationships and social interactions, people often have unspoken expectations, but in this case, Caroline's motivations were not clear to the author. The author acted on their own connection with Jack, which wasn't known to be off-limits. While it's possible to argue that the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's possible feelings, given the information, there's no indication that the author was aware of Caroline's crush. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility might lie with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions. The author had no reason to avoid Jack based on the information available during the trip.\n"
