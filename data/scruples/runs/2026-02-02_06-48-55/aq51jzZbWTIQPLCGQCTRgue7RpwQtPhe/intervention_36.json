I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. Caroline met a friend from her high school exchange program named Jack and introduced the author to Jack and his friends. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Then, while Caroline and Paul were out, the author hooked up with Jack. After that, Caroline got really upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack and had planned the trip to rekindle that. She blames the author for sleeping with Jack instead of letting her pursue him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was invited on the trip by Caroline. She had a history with Jack from high school, but she didn't communicate her feelings to the author during the trip. Instead, she focused on Paul, then later got angry when the author connected with Jack. The key points here are communication, intent, and friendship dynamics.\n\nCaroline's actions: She didn't tell the author about her crush on Jack beforehand. She might have been using Paul to try to get Jack's attention, but she didn't make her intentions clear. The author had no way of knowing that Jack was her target. The author and Jack grew close during the trip, and they had a mutual connection. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings until after the fact.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a situation where they developed a relationship with someone they met through their friend. The author had every reason to believe they were free to pursue Jack since Caroline had been with Paul and didn't mention her feelings before the hook-up. The author's actions were based on the situation as it presented itself during the trip, without prior knowledge of Caroline's intentions.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush, so there's no intent to interfere. However, the author did form a relationship with Jack while Caroline was supposedly trying to reconnect with him. But the main issue here is whether the author should have been more perceptive about Caroline's hidden agenda. The author might argue they had no way of knowing, and Caroline didn't communicate her plans. On the other hand, Caroline's actions could be seen as manipulative, using Paul to get Jack's attention and then blaming the author for the outcome.\n\nThe question is whether the author should be in the wrong for not realizing Caroline's secret plan. Since Caroline didn't communicate her feelings or intentions to the author, the author had no way of knowing. Therefore, the author isn't at fault. The problem lies more with Caroline's lack of communication and her manipulative behavior. The author might be in the right because they weren't aware of the situation and acted based on the information available during the trip.\n"
