I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline, their friend from college. Caroline had studied in Germany before and reconnected with Jack, her high school crush. She introduced the author to Jack and his friends. During the trip, Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, Jack's friend, and ended up hooking up with him. The rest of the trip, Caroline focused on Paul, while the author spent time with Jack, getting closer. Eventually, the author and Jack slept together. When Caroline found out, she was furious, feeling that the author ruined her plans to rekindle her crush with Jack by sleeping with him.\n\nThe key points here are about intentions and transparency. Caroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul to make Jack jealous\u2014are a bit manipulative. She used the trip to reconnect with Jack, but instead of being honest about her feelings, she went after Paul. The author, unaware of Caroline's true intentions, formed a connection with Jack and had a relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing that Caroline had a crush on Jack. They were just following the social interactions presented to them. Caroline's frustration stems from her own manipulative behavior and not being upfront about her intentions. The author didn't know about the crush and acted on their own feelings based on the time spent with Jack.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's history with Jack. But given that Caroline was the one who introduced the author to Jack and didn't mention her past crush, it's not clear that the author had any reason to suspect. The main issue lies with Caroline's lack of honesty and her using the trip for her own romantic agenda without clarifying her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they had no knowledge of Caroline's intentions and acted on their own experiences during the trip. The fault lies more with Caroline for not being transparent about her history with Jack.\n"
