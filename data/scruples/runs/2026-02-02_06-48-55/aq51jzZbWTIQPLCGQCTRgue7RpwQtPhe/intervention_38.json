I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a college friend, Caroline, and a trip to Germany where they meet Jack and Paul. \n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author on a trip to Germany. Then, during the trip, Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul and ended up hooking up with him. The author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually had a relationship with him. Now, Caroline is upset and claims she had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to make him jealous. She's angry the author didn't realize this and ended up with Jack instead.\n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to see my perspective. \n\nHmm. So, from the author's point of view, they were invited by Caroline to meet her friends. Jack and Paul were both there, but Caroline was focused on Paul. The author formed a connection with Jack, who didn't seem to be in a relationship at the time. The issue is that Caroline had a history with Jack from high school, which the author wasn't aware of. \n\nBut wait, Caroline was the one who hooked up with Paul first. The author says that Caroline was ignoring them during the trip, and they bonded with Jack. The key points here: Did the author have any reason to know about Caroline's crush on Jack beforehand? The story says that Caroline didn't mention it. She only revealed her intentions after the author and Jack hooked up. \n\nAlso, the author didn't know about the crush until after the fact. Caroline was actively pursuing Paul during the trip, so the author might not have been in the wrong. However, maybe the author should have been more aware of Caroline's past with Jack? But how? Caroline didn't disclose that information. \n\nAnother angle: The author and Jack developed feelings on their own. If Jack was single and not in a relationship, then the author isn't at fault. The problem is Caroline's actions, using Paul to make Jack jealous, which is manipulative. The author didn't know about Caroline's motives, so they can't be blamed for acting on their own connection with Jack. \n\nCaroline's reaction seems to be based on her own hidden agenda. The author's refusal to apologize makes sense if they didn't have prior knowledge. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
