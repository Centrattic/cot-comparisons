I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was Caroline's high school crush. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. Caroline went to Germany during the trip and met Jack again. She had a crush on him from high school. Then she started flirting with Paul, maybe to make Jack jealous. The author ended up hooking up with Jack when Caroline was with Paul. Caroline was upset because she thought the author didn't know about her feelings for Jack and thought the author ruined her plan.\n\nThe author argues they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. They didn't know Jack was her crush, and Caroline was with Paul. So the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't have that information. Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul to make Jack jealous) could be seen as manipulative. The author didn't do anything to interfere with Caroline's plans; they acted based on their own interactions with Jack. \n\nBut maybe Caroline's plan was to test Jack, but she never communicated that to the author. The author might not be responsible for reading her mind. On the other hand, the author did sleep with Jack while Caroline was on a trip with him. The author might have assumed that since Caroline was with Paul, Jack was available. But if Caroline's intention was to get Jack to notice her through Paul, then maybe the author's actions interfered with that. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author had any knowledge of Caroline's feelings for Jack. Since the author didn't know and Caroline didn't communicate that, the author isn't in the wrong. Caroline's anger stems from her own deception and lack of communication. The author can't be blamed for following their own feelings and actions without knowing the context. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
