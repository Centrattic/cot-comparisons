I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, ends up hooking up with him, and the author ends up spending time with Jack, who's a friend of Paul's. Eventually, the author and Jack hook up. Caroline then gets really upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her. She accuses the author of ruining the trip and being a slut. The author refuses to apologize, but now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Caroline was the one who initiated the trip, invited the author, and then started pursuing Paul. The author ended up getting close to Jack, and they ended up sleeping together. Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous, which is a bit manipulative. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack beforehand. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't know Caroline had a crush on Jack. They were just hanging out with Jack because Caroline was with Paul. The author and Jack were both single, and they consented to the hook-up. Caroline's reaction seems to be because her plan to use Paul backfired when the author ended up with Jack. \n\nBut wait, Caroline's actions might be problematic. She planned the trip with the intention to reconnect with Jack and test his feelings, which could be seen as using the author. Also, her decision to be with Paul while ignoring the author could have set up a situation where the author and Jack spent time together. However, the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, so they couldn't have avoided the situation. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack. Since both the author and Jack were single, and the hook-up happened when Caroline was with Paul, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The problem seems to stem from Caroline's own manipulative behavior and her not being honest about her feelings for Jack. She put the author in a position where they were spending time with Jack, which led to the hook-up. The author didn't know about the crush, so they can't be held responsible for it. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions. But the story doesn't indicate that Caroline gave any hints about her feelings for Jack before the trip. The author had no reason to suspect that Caroline wasn't being genuine with her interactions with Paul. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more with Caroline's actions and her lack of honesty. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
