I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack, who was their college friend Caroline's high school crush. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. So, Caroline and the author went on a trip to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush, and also met Paul. Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul, ended up hooking up with him, and then during the trip, the author got close to Jack and ended up sleeping with him. Caroline was mad because she thought she was supposed to get Jack back, and she accused the author of ruining the trip.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and intentions. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack because Caroline didn't communicate that. The author was just socializing with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't intentionally interfere; they were just getting close naturally. \n\nCaroline planned the trip partly to see if Jack still had feelings for her. The author couldn't have known that. So from the author's perspective, there's no indication they did anything wrong. Caroline's actions, like hooking up with Paul to make Jack jealous, might be more questionable. But the author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. \n\nThe author didn't have any reason to think they couldn't be with Jack. The problem seems to be that Caroline had a hidden agenda and didn't communicate her intentions. The author might feel they were set up in a situation where they weren't aware of the dynamics. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowing Caroline's true intentions. Caroline's frustration stems from unmet expectations and possibly poor communication on her part. The author made a choice based on the situation as they understood it. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
