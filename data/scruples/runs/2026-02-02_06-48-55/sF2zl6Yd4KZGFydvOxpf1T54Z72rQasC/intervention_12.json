She got upset and called me a misogynist and left. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for asking a woman if her two kids have the same father because they look different. The woman got upset and left, calling them a misogynist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around such questions. Asking about someone's children's paternity can be a sensitive topic. People might feel that such a question is prying into personal matters. Even if the question is asked without malice, it can come off as intrusive or assume something negative about the mother's situation.\n\nThe key here is the intent versus the impact. The author might have intended to be curious or avoid assumptions, but the impact was that the woman felt disrespected. The term \"misogynist\" implies sexism, which might be a strong reaction, but it shows the woman felt the question was gender-based and hurtful. \n\nIn many cultures, women are often judged more harshly about their personal lives and parenting situations. A question like this could trigger feelings of judgment or stigma. Even if the question is asked neutrally, the context of a casual meeting might not be the right setting for such a personal inquiry.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption that different appearances imply different fathers might not be accurate. There are many reasons kids might look different, like different heritages or family traits. The question itself makes an assumption that could be incorrect and offensive.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's question, while possibly not malicious, was inappropriate and caused harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
