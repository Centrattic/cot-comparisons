I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants the author to get a tattoo covered because it's another man's name. The author explains that the man was a mentor, like a father figure, who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 knew about this tattoo beforehand and didn't mind, but now he's making it a deal-breaker for marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a personal reason for the tattoo\u2014it's a tribute to someone important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 is now changing his stance after initially accepting it. The key points are consent and communication. The author made the tattoo before the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9 was aware and okay with it at the time. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is using it as a condition for marriage, which seems like a new issue that wasn't there before. \n\nI should also think about the nature of the relationship between the author and the person named in the tattoo. Since it's platonic and not a romantic or ex-boyfriend situation, the fianc\u00e9's objection might stem from insecurity or new feelings about the tattoo's significance. The author's refusal to cover it is about honoring their commitment to their mentor and their recovery journey. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to alter their body in a way that goes against their personal values just to please their fianc\u00e9, especially if the fianc\u00e9 had no issue with it before. The fianc\u00e9's sudden demand could be seen as controlling or not respecting the author's history and autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their decision.\n"
