I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 now wants the tattoo covered before marriage, even though he previously didn't seem to mind. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's perspective is that the tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone important in their life. They've explained the reasoning to their fianc\u00e9 before, and he seemed okay with it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a condition for marriage, which the author finds absurd. The author might feel that this is an unreasonable demand, especially since the tattoo has personal and emotional significance.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 might have developed feelings over time or perhaps his perspective changed. Maybe he's now uncomfortable with the visibility of the tattoo, especially since it's a name. There could be jealousy or a desire to have the author's body to himself, which is a common issue in relationships. The fianc\u00e9 might see the tattoo as a symbol of a past relationship that he wasn't part of, even if it was platonic. \n\nBut the key points here are that the author was transparent about the tattoo's meaning, and the fianc\u00e9 initially understood and accepted it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance, which could be seen as inconsiderate of the author's feelings and history. The author isn't hiding the tattoo but is being asked to cover something that's a tribute. The fianc\u00e9's new condition might be more about his own insecurities or changing views rather than the actual tattoo's significance.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some people might prioritize their partner's comfort in such matters, but others might see it as a personal choice that shouldn't be forced to change. The fact that the tattoo is a tribute to a deceased mentor adds another layer of emotional weight. The author might feel it's disrespectful to cover such a meaningful symbol. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason for the tattoo and have been open about it. The fianc\u00e9's sudden demand could be seen as selfish or not respecting the author's personal history. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
