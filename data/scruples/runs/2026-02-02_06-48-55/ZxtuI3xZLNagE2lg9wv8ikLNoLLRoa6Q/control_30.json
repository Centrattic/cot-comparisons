I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person has a tattoo of a mentor's name, which was a father figure who helped them recover. The fianc\u00e9 is now demanding they cover it up, but they didn't mind before. The author is upset because they feel it's a tribute and the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The tattoo was a tribute to a platonic relationship, a mentor who helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't seem to mind initially. Now he's changed his stance, making it a condition to marriage. The author is conflicted because they feel the tattoo is important and don't want to cover it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 is changing his position without a good reason. The tattoo was explained and accepted before. The author's reasons for keeping it are valid\u2014honoring a significant person in their life. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems to be an ultimatum without a legitimate reason. The author isn't doing anything to harm the relationship; the tattoo is personal and has positive meaning. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change could indicate insecurity or control issues. The author isn't wrong for wanting to keep a meaningful tattoo. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
