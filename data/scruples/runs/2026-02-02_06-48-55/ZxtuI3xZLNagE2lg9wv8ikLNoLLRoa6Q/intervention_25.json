I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants the other person to cover up a tattoo of a mentor's name, which was previously okay with the fianc\u00e9. The author is refusing to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The original questioner (AITA) is the one with the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9 is now objecting to it, even though he knew about it before and didn't mind. The author argues that the tattoo is a tribute to someone important in their life, a mentor and father figure who helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker, which the author finds absurd.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author had a meaningful reason for the tattoo. On the other, the fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about personal boundaries or insecurity. But the key point is that the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo beforehand and didn't object. Now he's using it as a condition for marriage, which the author is refusing to meet.\n\nIs the author wrong for not covering the tattoo? Well, it's their body, and they have the right to keep their tattoos. The fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as unreasonable, especially after agreeing to it initially. However, maybe there's a deeper issue. The fianc\u00e9 might have changed his mind for valid reasons, like feeling it's a symbol of a relationship that's more important to the author than their marriage, or he might feel insecure. But the fact that he knew about it and didn't mind before makes his current stance seem inconsistent.\n\nAlso, the author has already explained the significance, so the fianc\u00e9's refusal now might be about control or something else. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing a meaningful tattoo, especially if it's not from a romantic partner. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems more like a personal issue that he needs to address rather than the author's fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has a legitimate reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection after knowing about it is the issue here. The author isn't wrong for refusing to alter their body based on the fianc\u00e9's change of heart.\n"
