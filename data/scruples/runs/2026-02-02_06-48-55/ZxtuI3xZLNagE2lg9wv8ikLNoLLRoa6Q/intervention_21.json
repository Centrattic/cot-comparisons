I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who refuses to marry the author unless they cover up a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author argues that the tattoo is a tribute and they've explained this to their fianc\u00e9, who initially understood but is now making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a tattoo of a man who was a mentor and father figure, and it's a part of their personal history and recovery journey. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now it's an issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not getting it covered.\n\nOn one hand, the author's position is that the tattoo holds significant personal meaning and they've already shared this with their partner. The fianc\u00e9 is now changing his stance, which might indicate a shift in his priorities or a deeper insecurity. The author might feel that their autonomy and personal history are being disregarded. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have personal issues with the tattoo, perhaps feeling insecure about the relationship with the mentor or not wanting to be compared to someone else. However, since the relationship was platonic and the mentor is deceased, the fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than the actual situation. The fact that he initially didn't mind but now does could suggest that he's realizing something he wasn't considering before, but it's still his own issue to work through.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't doing anything wrong by keeping the tattoo as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9's problem lies in his change of heart and using it as a condition for marriage. The author isn't obligated to remove something that's a part of their identity because someone else is uncomfortable with it. That said, the author should consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings and whether this is a deal-breaker for the relationship. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9 is the one making a demand based on his own insecurities. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
