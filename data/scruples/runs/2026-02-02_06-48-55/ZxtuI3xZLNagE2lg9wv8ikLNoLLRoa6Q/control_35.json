I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, which was meant as a tribute. The mentor was like a father figure who helped them get clean before passing away. The fianc\u00e9 now wants the tattoo covered before marriage, which the author finds absurd because the fianc\u00e9 previously seemed okay with it. The author is upset because the tattoo is a meaningful memorial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author has a valid reason for the tattoo\u2014it's a tribute to someone important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't object at first, but now has changed their stance. That sudden change might be what's causing the conflict. The author feels they're being asked to erase something meaningful for no good reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have personal issues with the tattoo now. Maybe they're uncomfortable with the reminder of a past relationship, even if it was platonic. Or perhaps they have insecurity about their own role in the author's life compared to this mentor. However, the author did explain the significance, so if the fianc\u00e9 didn't mind before, changing their mind now could be seen as unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep the tattoo as a personal memorial. The fianc\u00e9 might need to address their own feelings rather than making the author remove it. So the answer is probably B.\n"
