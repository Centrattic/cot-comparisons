I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the author covers a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author explains the tattoo is a tribute to a man who was like a father figure, helped them get clean, and passed away. They told their fianc\u00e9 about it before, and the fianc\u00e9 said he understood. Now he's changing his mind.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The author's reasoning is that the tattoo is meaningful and a tribute. They weren't in a romantic relationship with the man. The fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind initially. Now, he's making it a deal-breaker. \n\nIs the author wrong for refusing to cover the tattoo? Well, the tattoo was placed for personal reasons, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it. The author has a legitimate emotional connection to the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo itself. The author isn't doing anything wrong by keeping their tribute. They have the right to keep their personal history. The fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
