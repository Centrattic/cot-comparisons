I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants the other person to cover up a tattoo of a mentor's name, which is a platonic relationship. The author is refusing because they see it as a tribute and their fianc\u00e9 didn't seem to mind before. Now it's become a condition for marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons each party has. The author has a tattoo that's a memoriam for a mentor who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 is now asking to cover it. But the author says the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind at first. Now it's a problem. The author is upset because they feel betrayed that the fianc\u00e9 didn't mind before but now it's a deal-breaker.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship with the person in the tattoo (platonic, not a romantic or ex-partner), the fianc\u00e9's initial acceptance, and the sudden change in stance. The author's tattoo is a personal and meaningful tribute, which is their right to have. The fianc\u00e9's decision to make this a condition for marriage after previously not caring might be a red flag about their priorities. The author isn't the one who changed their stance here. The fianc\u00e9 is now imposing a condition that wasn't there before, which could indicate insecurity or control issues. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid reasons for changing their mind, but the author already explained the tattoo's significance, so the fianc\u00e9 needs to respect that. If the fianc\u00e9 can't accept the author's personal history and choices, then maybe the marriage isn't going to work. The author isn't wrong for standing by their tattoo, which is a part of their personal history and recovery. The fianc\u00e9 might be wrong for making this about control or insecurity. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
