I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered, but the author feels strongly about keeping it as a tribute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The tattoo is of a mentor who helped the author get clean and acted as a father figure. The author explains this to the fianc\u00e9, who initially understood but now is making it a deal-breaker. The key points here are the nature of the relationship, the explanation provided, and the sudden change in the fianc\u00e9's stance.\n\nThe author isn't covering an ex-boyfriend's name; it's a mentor. That's important because it's about respect and memory, not a romantic relationship. The author has a valid reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's position seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 now wants it covered despite knowing the backstory suggests a lack of trust or understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, in a relationship, both partners might have needs and expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9's demand is conditional (not marrying unless the tattoo is covered), which could be seen as ultimatum-like. The author has explained the significance, and if the fianc\u00e9 still insists on this, it's about his own feelings rather than the author's reasons.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a good reason to keep the tattoo, and it's part of their personal history and recovery. The fianc\u00e9's insistence might be his own issue, not the author's fault.\n"
