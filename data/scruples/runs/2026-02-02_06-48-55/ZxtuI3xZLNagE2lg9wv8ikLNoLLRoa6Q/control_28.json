I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the other person covers a tattoo of a mentor's name. The writer argues that the tattoo is a tribute to their recovery and a father figure, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before but now it's a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The tattoo is of a mentor, not a past lover, and was done as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 initially understood but now wants it covered. The writer feels wronged because they see the tattoo as meaningful and the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. To decide, I should consider if the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable. The author's tattoo has a deep personal significance, and the fianc\u00e9 was aware of it. Changing his position after saying he understood could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, people's feelings can change, and maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid reasons now. But given the explanation, the author isn't in the wrong because the tattoo isn't about a past relationship but a tribute. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
