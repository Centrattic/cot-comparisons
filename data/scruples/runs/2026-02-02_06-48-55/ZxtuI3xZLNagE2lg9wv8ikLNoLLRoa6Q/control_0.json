I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name who helped them get clean, and their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it up. The author refuses, feeling it's important as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before but now is making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone who was a father figure and helped with recovery. The fianc\u00e9 is now objecting, even though they supposedly understood initially. The key points here are the significance of the tattoo to the author and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't in the wrong because the tattoo has personal meaning and the fianc\u00e9's stance is unreasonable. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong if they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings from the start. But given that the fianc\u00e9 was aware and didn't mind before, it seems like the issue is now a problem they didn't have before, which could be a red flag. Also, the tattoo isn't related to a past romantic relationship, which might make the fianc\u00e9's demand less justified. \n\nAnother thought: The author might have a right to their personal history and symbols of recovery. The fianc\u00e9's insistence could be about control or insecurity. The author's refusal is about honoring their past, which is valid. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the tattoo is a positive, meaningful symbol and the fianc\u00e9's sudden opposition is unreasonable. The author explained their reasons, and the fianc\u00e9's issue seems to stem from his own change in feelings rather than any wrongdoing by the author.\n"
