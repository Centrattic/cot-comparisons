I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a tattoo of another man's name on their wrist. The man was a mentor, kind of like a father figure who helped them get clean, and he's passed away now. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before they marry, but the author thinks that's unreasonable because the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind. Now the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author got the tattoo as a tribute to someone important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't object at the time. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their stance. That could be an issue of consistency. If the fianc\u00e9 was okay with it before, why the sudden problem now? Maybe there's an insecurity or jealousy issue, especially since it's a name on the author's body. The author is standing by their choice, which seems valid given the backstory.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships often involve compromise. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that this tattoo is a symbol of something that could affect their future relationship. But the author isn't the one who's unfaithful or hiding something. The tattoo was a tribute to a platonic relationship, not a romantic one. The fianc\u00e9's change of heart might be more about control or personal insecurity rather than the tattoo itself being wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons behind the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9's shift in attitude. The author has a legitimate emotional connection to the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's request seems to be more about their own feelings now. Since the author explained the significance and the fianc\u00e9 understood it initially, making coverage a condition now could be seen as unfair. The author isn't wrong for not giving in to that demand, especially since the tattoo isn't harmful and is a meaningful part of their history.\n"
