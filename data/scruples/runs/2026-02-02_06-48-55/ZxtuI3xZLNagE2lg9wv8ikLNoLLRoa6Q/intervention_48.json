I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, which was a platonic relationship, and their fianc\u00e9 now wants the tattoo covered before marriage. The author thinks it's absurd because the fianc\u00e9 previously didn't mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got the tattoo as a tribute to a mentor who helped them get clean. The relationship was strictly platonic, and the fianc\u00e9 was aware of this. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making an issue out of it. The author is refusing to cover it, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a personal, meaningful reason for the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change in stance might be an issue here. Did the fianc\u00e9 have valid reasons now that he didn't have before? The author might feel that the tattoo is important to their identity and recovery. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have personal insecurities or new reasons for wanting it covered. But since the relationship was known and accepted before, the fianc\u00e9's current demand could be seen as unreasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing their personal history and tribute. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
