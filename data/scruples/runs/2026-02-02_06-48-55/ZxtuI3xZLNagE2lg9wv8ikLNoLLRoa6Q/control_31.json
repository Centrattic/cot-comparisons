I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting the other person to cover up a tattoo of a mentor's name. The writer refuses, saying it's a tribute to a platonic relationship, not a romantic one. The fianc\u00e9 initially didn't mind but now is making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The tattoo isn't of an ex or a romantic partner but a mentor figure who helped them get clean. The writer explains the context to the fianc\u00e9, who said he understood. Now the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, the tattoo has personal significance and was done with the fianc\u00e9's prior knowledge. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a prenuptial condition. The writer's refusal to alter it might be seen as holding onto something meaningful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel it's a boundary issue or insecurity. But since the relationship is supposed to be built on mutual respect, the fianc\u00e9's sudden demand could be the issue here. The writer isn't hiding the tattoo's meaning; they've explained it. So, likely, the writer isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
