I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name that their fianc\u00e9 now wants to cover. The author explains the tattoo is a tribute to someone who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it initially but now is making it a deal-breaker.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the reasons behind the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart. The author had valid reasons for getting the tattoo\u2014it's a meaningful tribute. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind before. Now, he's making it a condition for marriage. That seems like a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep a meaningful tattoo from their past, especially since they've explained it. The fianc\u00e9's demand feels controlling and perhaps a new issue that wasn't discussed earlier. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
