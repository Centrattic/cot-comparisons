I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting the author to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name, which the author refuses. The author argues that the tattoo is a tribute and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind before. Now the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker for marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone important in their life, which they've already explained to their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's stance is that they now want it covered, possibly due to personal discomfort or insecurity. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author chose to get the tattoo as a tribute, which is a personal decision. They were honest about it from the start. The fianc\u00e9 changed his position later, even though he initially accepted it. The author isn't obligated to remove or cover something that's significant to them just because the fianc\u00e9 changed his mind. That might be a matter of personal respect and boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's some deeper issue here. Could the fianc\u00e9 have valid reasons, like feeling insecure or not respecting the author's past? But the author explained that the relationship was platonic and not romantic. If the fianc\u00e9 can't accept that, maybe it's a trust or insecurity issue on his part. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by their choice. The fianc\u00e9 is making a demand that's a new issue, after already knowing about the tattoo and not objecting before. The author's refusal isn't something that's inherently wrong if it's a personal boundary. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
