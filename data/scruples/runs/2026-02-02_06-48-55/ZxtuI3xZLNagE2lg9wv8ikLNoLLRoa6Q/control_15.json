I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to get a tattoo covered. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it before marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: the tattoo is a tribute to someone important in their life, a platonic relationship, not a past boyfriend. They explained this to the fianc\u00e9 before, who supposedly understood. Now the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker. The author is upset because they feel the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind initially, but now it's a problem.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the tattoo is part of their personal history and recovery. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about control or insecurity. The author isn't doing anything harmful by keeping the tattoo; it's a personal choice. The fianc\u00e9's request seems more about their own feelings or values, not the author's actions. The author has a valid emotional connection to the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9 should respect that unless there's a compelling reason, but the author hasn't given a reason to cover it. So, the author isn't wrong for refusing to alter their body against their will. The fianc\u00e9 is imposing their own conditions that weren't discussed upfront. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
