I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, which was a tribute and part of their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 now wants the tattoo covered before marrying them, even though they knew about it before and didn't mind at first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that the tattoo is meaningful, representing a platonic, father-like relationship with their mentor. They had explained this to the fianc\u00e9, who initially understood. Now the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker. The author feels wronged because they thought the tattoo was acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that they want the tattoo covered. Maybe they have personal reasons, like not wanting to be associated with someone else's name or feeling uncomfortable. But they knew about it before and didn't mind, so changing their mind later could be seen as being the asshole. However, if they're now uncomfortable, perhaps they have valid feelings.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a tattoo they chose for personal reasons. Emotionally, the issue is about respecting boundaries. The author isn't obligated to remove or cover the tattoo, especially if it's a meaningful tribute. The fianc\u00e9 is imposing their own feelings after knowing the backstory. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
