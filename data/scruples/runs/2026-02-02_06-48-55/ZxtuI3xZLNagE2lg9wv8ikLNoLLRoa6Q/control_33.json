I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker, even though he knew about it before and didn't seem to mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the tattoo. The person got it as a tribute to someone who was important in their life and recovery. The relationship was platonic, not romantic or sexual. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and initially didn't have a problem. Now, he's suddenly making it a condition for marriage. That seems like a change of heart, which could be a problem.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel insecure or uncomfortable with the tattoo, even if the reasoning is rational. On the other hand, the person has a valid reason for the tattoo and has explained it. The fianc\u00e9's new stance might be a red flag about his priorities or trust issues. The person has the right to have personal tattoos that hold significant meaning to them. Marriage should involve mutual respect for each other's past and choices. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect that, maybe the problem isn't with the tattoo but with his willingness to accept the person for who they are. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable.\n"
