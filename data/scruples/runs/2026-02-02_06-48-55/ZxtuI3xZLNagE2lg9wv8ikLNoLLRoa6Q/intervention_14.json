I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the other person covers a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo initially but now it's a problem. The author is against covering it because it's a tribute to someone who was like a father figure and helped them get clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author has a valid reason for the tattoo\u2014it's a meaningful tribute to a significant person in their life. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might be about control or insecurity, especially since they knew about it before. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing this memorial. The fianc\u00e9's demand to cover it could be seen as unreasonable, especially if they previously understood the significance. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
