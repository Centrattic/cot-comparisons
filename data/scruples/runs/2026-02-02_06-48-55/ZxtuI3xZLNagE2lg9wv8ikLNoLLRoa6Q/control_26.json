I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, which is a tribute to someone who helped them get clean and was like a father figure. Their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it up before marriage, but the author refuses. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains the tattoo's significance: it's a memorial and a symbol of their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it initially and didn't mind, but now it's an issue. That seems odd. If the fianc\u00e9 only has a problem with it now, maybe there's some underlying reason. The author isn't in the wrong for honoring a mentor, especially if the relationship was platonic. However, maybe cultural or personal beliefs about tattoos play a role here. But the key point is that the fianc\u00e9 changed his stance after agreeing to it before. The author's refusal isn't about being disrespectful to the fianc\u00e9 but about respecting their own history. So, it's more about the fianc\u00e9's current demands being unreasonable given prior acceptance. Therefore, the author isn't wrong to stand by their tattoo.\n"
