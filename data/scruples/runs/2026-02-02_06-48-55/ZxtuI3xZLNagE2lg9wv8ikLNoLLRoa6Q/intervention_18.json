I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name, which they got as a tribute. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 previously didn't seem to mind, and they explain that the man was a mentor, not a romantic partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, a platonic relationship, and it's a tribute to recovery and the mentor's help. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a condition for marriage, which the author finds absurd. The author claims the fianc\u00e9 understood and didn't mind before.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author's refusal to cover the tattoo is the mistake. The author has a legitimate reason for the tattoo\u2014it's a meaningful tribute to someone who helped them. The fianc\u00e9's change of heart could stem from insecurity or new concerns. However, the author also needs to consider their partner's feelings. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels that having another man's name on the author's body is a red flag, even if it's platonic. \n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong for having the tattoo. They made it clear it's not a romantic thing, and it's a significant part of their personal history. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems more about his own feelings than the tattoo's validity. The author isn't obligated to remove a meaningful tattoo unless it's causing a problem. The fianc\u00e9's ultimatum might be the real issue here. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
