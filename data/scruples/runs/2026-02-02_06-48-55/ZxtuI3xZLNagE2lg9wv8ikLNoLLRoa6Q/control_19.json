I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it before marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The relationship was platonic, not romantic. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind at first but now it's a problem. The person argues that since it's a meaningful memorial, they shouldn't have to cover it.\n\nSo, the key points: the tattoo has personal significance, the relationship wasn't romantic, and the fianc\u00e9 changed his stance. The person feels it's important to keep the tattoo visible as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker, which the person finds absurd.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the tattoo is a meaningful part of their life and recovery. The fianc\u00e9 had prior knowledge and didn't object initially. Changing the stance now could be seen as being inconsiderate of the personal significance. The author has a valid reason to keep it, especially since the relationship wasn't romantic. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the tattoo's significance and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart are key factors.\n"
