I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name when their fianc\u00e9 is demanding it. The author has a tattoo of a man's name\u2014strictly platonic, a mentor who helped them get clean. They've explained this to their fianc\u00e9, who initially seemed okay with it but now is making it a dealbreaker for marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid reason for the tattoo: it's a tribute to a significant person in their life who had a positive impact. The relationship was platonic, not romantic or sexual. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now is changing their stance. That's a red flag. The fianc\u00e9 is using this as a condition to marry, which seems controlling. The author is standing by their decision not to remove it, which is their right. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author has already shared the story, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in position might indicate insecurity or lack of understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing their personal history and recovery. The fianc\u00e9's demand is unreasonable unless there's a valid reason related to their relationship that's not mentioned here. Since there's no indication the author is being disrespectful or hiding something, they have the right to keep the tattoo. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
