I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, who wasn't a romantic partner, and their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it up before marriage. The author is refusing because they feel it's a tribute.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The tattoo is of a mentor who helped the author get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it initially but now wants it covered. The author is upset because they explained the significance before, and the fianc\u00e9 claims to have understood. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker for the marriage.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So the question is whether the author is wrong for not covering the tattoo. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The tattoo has sentimental value and represents a meaningful relationship. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about personal insecurities or control rather than the tattoo itself. The author isn't in a romantic relationship with the person whose name is tattooed, so the fianc\u00e9's objection could be irrational.\n\nHowever, in relationships, both partners have expectations. If the fianc\u00e9 genuinely has an issue with the tattoo now, even after knowing about it, the author might need to consider their partner's feelings. But the author isn't obligated to alter their body against their will. The fianc\u00e9 is making a demand that could be seen as controlling, especially if it's a new issue after previously accepting it.\n\nSo, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. They have a valid reason for keeping the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's demand could be the problem. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
