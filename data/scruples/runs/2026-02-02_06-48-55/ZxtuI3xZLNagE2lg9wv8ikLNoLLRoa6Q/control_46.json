I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the author covers up a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author explains the tattoo's significance\u2014it's a tribute to a platonic, father-like mentor who helped them get clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author got the tattoo as a tribute, which is a meaningful personal choice. The fianc\u00e9 initially didn't mind but now is making it a deal-breaker. The key points here are consent and understanding. The author says the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't have an issue before. Now, changing the stance might be about the fianc\u00e9's own issues or insecurity, not the tattoo itself being wrong.\n\nThe tattoo's story is about respect for a mentor and recovery. The author isn't hiding a past relationship but honoring someone who was a positive influence. The fianc\u00e9's demand to cover it up could be seen as disregarding the author's personal history and values. Unless there's some cultural or religious reason the fianc\u00e9 has for this, it seems more like a personal insecurity or change of heart.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because they made a meaningful choice that was accepted initially. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might be about control or lack of respect for the author's past. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is making an unreasonable demand without valid cause, especially after previously accepting the tattoo.\n"
