I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should get a tattoo of another man's name covered. The author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist as a tribute, which was a platonic relationship. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind initially, but now it's a deal-breaker unless it's covered.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to cover the tattoo. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the tattoo's significance: it's a tribute to a mentor who helped them get clean and passed away. The author explains that the relationship was platonic, not romantic. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't have an issue at first. Now, he's changed his mind. \n\nIs the author wrong for not covering it? Well, tattoos can be personal and meaningful. If the author feels strongly about keeping it as a tribute, that's their personal choice. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be based on insecurity or jealousy, even if there's no romantic history. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and past is important. The author has explained the reason, so if the fianc\u00e9 is now making it a condition for marriage, that could be seen as unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to cover a tattoo that's significant to them, especially if the fianc\u00e9 was aware of it beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid reasons, but given the context, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect. If the fianc\u00e9 can't accept that, maybe the issue is with his trust or insecurity rather than the author's choice. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
