I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants them to get it covered before marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is of a mentor, not a past lover. The author explains the mentor was like a father figure who helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it initially and didn't mind but now has a problem. \n\nI need to consider cultural or personal values around tattoos. Some people might view a tattoo as a personal choice and changing the requirement later as unfair. Especially since the fianc\u00e9 was aware of the tattoo's significance before. \n\nThe author has a valid emotional reason for keeping the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection could be about control or insecurity. The key points are consent and understanding at the time. If the fianc\u00e9 agreed before, changing stance now without good reason might make the author not at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a meaningful reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart could be the issue here.\n"
