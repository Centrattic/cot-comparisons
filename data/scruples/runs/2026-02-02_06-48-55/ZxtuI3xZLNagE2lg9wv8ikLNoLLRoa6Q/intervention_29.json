The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, which was a tribute to both the mentor and their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 is now refusing to marry them unless the tattoo is covered. The author feels this is absurd because the fianc\u00e9 initially didn't seem to mind and now is changing his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They had a meaningful tattoo from a platonic, father-like mentor who helped them. They got it as a tribute, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before. The author is standing by their choice, which is personal and significant to them. So, the author's argument is that the tattoo is important and the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 is suddenly making this a deal-breaker. The question here is whether the fianc\u00e9's new stance is justified or if the author is being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9 did claim to understand at first, but now it's an issue. That could suggest a change of heart for no good reason, which might make the author right in refusing to cover it. But maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid feelings now that weren't apparent before. However, the author had explained the significance, so if the fianc\u00e9 still has a problem, that might be his issue, not the author's.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to personal autonomy regarding their body and the significance of the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems like an ultimatum without a good reason, especially since it was acceptable before. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep the tribute. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
