I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage, but the author feels it's absurd because the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind before.\n\nFirst, the context: the tattoo is of a mentor who helped the author get clean and passed away. The relationship was platonic, more like a father figure. The author explains this to the fianc\u00e9, who initially understood but now it's an issue.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the key points are consent and respect. The author's reasons for the tattoo are personal and meaningful. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be a control issue or insecurity. The author isn't doing anything harmful by keeping the tattoo. The fianc\u00e9 is making a demand based on knowledge he already had. The author has the right to keep a meaningful symbol from their past. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to accept it without valid reasons could be the problem here. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
