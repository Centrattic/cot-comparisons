I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who refuses to get a tattoo of another man's name covered. The tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who helped them recover and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 originally didn't mind but now is making it a condition for marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a meaningful tattoo, part of their personal history and a tribute to someone important. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't object before but now is changing their stance. Why the change? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has new feelings about it, perhaps due to insecurity, jealousy, or a shift in priorities now that they're getting serious. The author might feel it's a violation of their personal choice and body autonomy. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why would that be the case? Maybe they believe that since the fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker, the author should comply to maintain the relationship. But that's not straightforward. If the tattoo is a significant part of the author's identity, forcing them to cover it could be seen as disrespectful. The fianc\u00e9's initial acceptance is important; if they agreed to it before, is it fair to demand a change after the fact? \n\nAlso, the nature of the relationship between the author and the man whose name is tattooed is strictly platonic, which might help the author's case. The fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting, but maybe there are valid reasons from the fianc\u00e9's side. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't the one who initially had an issue, the fianc\u00e9 is the one changing their mind. The author's right to their own body and the meaning behind the tattoo seems valid. \n\nBut the user is suggesting the author is wrong, so I need to check if there's a point where the author could be expected to accommodate their partner's feelings, even if it's a new concern. However, tattoos are permanent, and covering them can be expensive and painful. It's a big ask. If the fianc\u00e9 is using this as a leverage point now, maybe they didn't consider it before. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) forums, usually, the person who makes unreasonable demands for a change in a partner's body is seen as the asshole. The author's tattoo has a deep meaning and was done with consent from the fianc\u00e9 at the time. The fianc\u00e9's sudden opposition might be the issue here. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
