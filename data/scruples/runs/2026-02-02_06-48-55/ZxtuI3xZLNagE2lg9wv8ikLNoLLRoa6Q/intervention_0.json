I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered as a condition for marriage. The author explains that the tattoo was a tribute to a mentor who helped them get clean and passed away, and that the relationship was platonic.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: they have a meaningful tattoo that represents a significant person in their life, and they feel it's important to keep it as a memorial. They argue that the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind at first. Now, it's a sudden demand, which the author finds absurd.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective: maybe they have personal issues with the tattoo, even if it's not from a romantic past. Perhaps they feel it's a symbol that conflicts with their own values or future plans for the marriage. Or maybe they're acting out of insecurity or jealousy, even if the relationship was platonic.\n\nThe key points here are consent and understanding. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind initially. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their stance, which could indicate a lack of communication or a sudden insecurity. The author's refusal to cover it might be about personal autonomy and honoring a deceased mentor. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's their body and their choice. They have the right to decide how they want to present themselves. However, marriage involves compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 is making a demand based on new concerns, maybe the author isn't wrong in resisting. The fianc\u00e9 might need to address their own feelings instead of making it a condition for marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is unwilling to make any concessions, that could be a problem. But in this case, the tattoo is a memorial, which is a significant personal reason. The fianc\u00e9 should consider the meaning behind it and communicate their concerns. The author isn't in the wrong for not covering it if they've already explained the significance and the fianc\u00e9's new stance is unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author is not in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason for the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in position might not be justified. The author is protecting their personal history and honoring someone important to them.\n"
