I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage. The author explains the tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 initially didn't mind but now it's a problem.\n\nFirst, the tattoo's significance is clear: it's a meaningful tribute, not a past relationship. The author isn't hiding a lover's name but honoring someone who was important in their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind before, but now is making it a deal-breaker. That seems a bit contradictory. The author isn't doing anything wrong by keeping a meaningful part of their past. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about control or insecurity. The author has a valid reason to keep the tattoo, so they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
