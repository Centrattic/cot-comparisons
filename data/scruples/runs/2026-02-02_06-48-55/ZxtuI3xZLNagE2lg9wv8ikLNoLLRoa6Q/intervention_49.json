I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to get a tattoo of another man's name covered. The fianc\u00e9 wants the name covered before they get married. The author explains that the name is of a mentor who helped them, not a past lover, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't seem to mind before.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is the concept of trust and respect in a relationship. The author got the tattoo as a tribute, which is a personal and meaningful gesture. The fianc\u00e9 is now making an issue of it, even after saying they understood before. That could be a problem because it's a change of heart without a valid reason. Also, the author has already explained the significance, so maybe the fianc\u00e9's new stance is more about insecurity or control rather than the actual tattoo.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid feelings about it now. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they have a right to get a tattoo of someone important to them. The fianc\u00e9 is using this as a condition for marriage, which could be a red flag about their priorities. The author is standing by their choice, which seems reasonable. So I think the author is not in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
