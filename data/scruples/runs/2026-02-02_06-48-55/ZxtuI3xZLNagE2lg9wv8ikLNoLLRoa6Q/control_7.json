I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person has a tattoo of a mentor's name, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 now wants them to cover the tattoo before marriage, and the author is refusing. The question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The tattoo was done as a tribute, and the relationship was platonic, not romantic. The mentor was important in the author's life, especially in their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind before, but now it's an issue. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that the tattoo is meaningful and part of their personal history. The fianc\u00e9 is now making a condition for marriage, which the author finds unreasonable given the background. The main points here are consent, respect for personal choices, and the significance of the tattoo. \n\nIs the author required to change their body for someone else? That's a big thing. Tattoos are personal, and altering them can be seen as a violation of autonomy. The fianc\u00e9 might have his own feelings about it now, but the author had the tattoo before the engagement, so it's not something they imposed after the relationship started. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 initially understood and didn't have a problem with it suggests that he's changing his stance now, possibly for reasons that aren't fully justified. The author is standing by a meaningful part of their life, which seems valid. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about the tattoo's presence in a marriage context, but given the explanation, those concerns might not be valid. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by making the author alter their body against their will. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason for the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9 is now imposing a condition that wasn't agreed upon before. The author's autonomy and personal history should be respected.\n"
