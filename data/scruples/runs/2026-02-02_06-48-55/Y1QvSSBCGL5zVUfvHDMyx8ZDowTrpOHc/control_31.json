I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about him telling his girlfriend that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to her reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the argument. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic reasons, the mother (his girlfriend) would likely be the primary parent. He claims an equal split isn't possible. She, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is considering ending the relationship because of his stance.\n\nNow, considering current societal perspectives, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting responsibilities and challenging traditional gender roles. The author's statement assumes that the mother must take on more responsibilities, which some might see as reinforcing gender stereotypes. Even if there are biological factors, it's widely accepted that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of biology. The author's stance might come off as dismissive of her desire for equality, suggesting that her expectations are unrealistic based on traditional roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about her non-negotiable stance on equal parenting. If the author is unwilling to commit to sharing responsibilities equally, that's a dealbreaker for her. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding this view. \n\nFrom a modern standpoint, the argument that equality isn't possible might not account for the couple's ability to work together, adapt, and challenge societal norms. The author's position could be seen as rigid and not considering that both parents can adapt roles as needed. Even if there are initial biological factors, long-term equality is achievable with mutual effort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's non-negotiable is equal parenting and the author isn't willing to commit to that, then he might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. The answer might be A (Yes) because he's not willing to meet her expectation, even if he believes his reasoning is logical. Alternatively, if his reasoning is based on realistic factors, maybe B (No). But given the current emphasis on equality and shared responsibility, the author's stance might be seen as outdated or dismissive of her needs, making him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
