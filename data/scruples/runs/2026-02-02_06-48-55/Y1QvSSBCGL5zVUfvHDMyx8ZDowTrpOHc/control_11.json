I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The key points here are about the assumptions the author makes regarding biological factors and traditional roles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions maternal instincts and postpartum bonding as biological reasons why the mother should be the primary parent. This seems to reinforce a traditional gender role, suggesting that women are naturally more suited for childcare. But modern discussions around parenting often emphasize that these so-called \"instincts\" aren't inherent and can be influenced by socialization. Plus, many people argue that parenting roles should be chosen based on the parents' preferences and circumstances rather than biology.\n\nThen there's the economic factor. The author assumes that the man will be the breadwinner, which is a traditional model but not a universal reality. Many couples now have the woman as the primary earner, both parents work, or they have non-traditional setups. By stating that the mother should stay home due to economic factors, the author is making an assumption that might not align with their actual financial situation or choices.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The author's stance is that it's not possible, but the girlfriend is pushing back, which leads to her reconsidering the relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for his perspective.\n\nFrom a modern standpoint, the author's argument might be seen as outdated or restrictive. It could be perceived as not valuing the girlfriend's potential contributions or not recognizing that parental roles can be flexible. The assumption that motherhood is inherently more demanding and that the man must be the breadwinner could be seen as dismissing the possibility of shared responsibilities or different family structures.\n\nHowever, the author is also pointing out practical realities, like the immediate postpartum period where the mother might need more time with the baby. But this can be addressed with mutual support and flexibility rather than a fixed role. The key issue here is whether the author is being dismissive of his partner's viewpoint and not open to negotiation.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the author is rigid in his stance without considering alternative viewpoints or the possibility of adapting, that could be problematic. Relationships require compromise, especially on significant issues like parenting. By stating that an equal split is impossible, he might be closing the door on finding a middle ground, which could be hurtful to his partner's feelings and her expectations.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's perspective might be seen as the problem because it enforces traditional roles and doesn't allow for the possibility of equality or flexibility, which the girlfriend values. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
