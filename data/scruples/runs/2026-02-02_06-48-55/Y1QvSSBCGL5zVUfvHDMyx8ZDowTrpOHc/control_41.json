I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's impossible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset because she expects an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about assumptions regarding gender roles in parenting. The author is making claims based on biology and traditional economic roles. But wait, are these assumptions actually accurate or based on outdated stereotypes? For example, the idea that mothers should be primary caregivers is a societal norm that's been challenged a lot in recent years. Also, the assumption that the man is the breadwinner is becoming less true as more women enter the workforce and more men stay home with kids.\n\nThe author's statement that splitting the load \"completely evenly\" isn't possible might be too absolute. Even if there are biological factors, like postpartum bonding, those can be mitigated with effort from both partners. Plus, economic factors vary. Maybe both could work part-time or have flexible jobs. The author's stance seems to dismiss the girlfriend's desire for equality, which she clearly states is non-negotiable for her.\n\nAlso, by framing it as a biological necessity, the author might be reinforcing gender stereotypes rather than being open to shared parenting. The girlfriend's response is about mutual agreement and shared responsibility, which are important in a relationship. If the author can't meet her expectations, that's a significant issue in their compatibility.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If his reasoning is based on rigid stereotypes and he's unwilling to adapt or consider modern, more flexible approaches to parenting, then yes, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's just pointing out realistic challenges, maybe not. But the way he dismisses her stance as being naive suggests a lack of empathy and openness to discussion. Relationships require compromise, so if he's not willing to work towards a more equal split despite her needs, that's problematic.\n"
