I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which would mean the girlfriend should be the primary caregiver. The girlfriend is upset because he doesn't seem to agree to an equal split in parenting duties, leading her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making a case based on biological differences, suggesting that it's impossible to split parenting equally. But is that a valid or fair argument? On the other hand, the girlfriend wants equality, which is a common modern expectation in relationships. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable or if it's imposing outdated gender roles.\n\nThe author mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. However, this is a stereotype and doesn't account for dual-income households where both partners work. Even if there are biological factors, assuming the woman must be the primary parent ignores the possibility of shared responsibilities or flexible arrangements. The author's argument could be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality and reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be insensitive.\n\nAlso, the author's assertion that equality isn't possible might be a way of avoiding shared responsibility. The girlfriend is clear that she wants an equal split, and the author's refusal here could be a dealbreaker for her. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's non-negotiables clash with the other's, it's a significant issue. The author might be failing to see that the girlfriend's stance is about fairness and mutual effort, not just unrealistic expectations.\n\nMoreover, the mention of maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, while rooted in biology, doesn't have to dictate the post-birth parenting roles. Many modern families choose shared parenting regardless of these factors. The author's position could be viewed as dismissing the girlfriend's role beyond just biological aspects and not valuing her potential as an equal parent. It's possible he's underestimating the adaptability of both parents to share responsibilities, even with initial challenges.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the girlfriend is not willing to have children unless there's equality, and the author isn't willing to commit to that, their fundamental values clash. The author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging her perspective and the importance she places on equality. It's not just about the feasibility of splitting tasks but about respecting each other's views on partnership.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's argument seems to rely on outdated assumptions and doesn't sufficiently consider the girlfriend's perspective on equality. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
