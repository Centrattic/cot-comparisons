I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic reasons where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split, which the author says isn't possible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is making generalizations about the roles of mothers and fathers based on biology and economics. But is that a valid assumption? The girlfriend is pushing for equality, which is a common modern expectation in relationships. The author's stance seems to be that equality isn't feasible, especially immediately after birth, and that the mother will naturally be the primary caregiver. However, this might be based on outdated or stereotypical views. \n\nModern discussions around parenting often emphasize shared responsibilities, though there are biological differences like childbirth and postpartum bonding. But the idea that the mother must be the primary parent because of these factors might not account for the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to adapt. The author's argument could be seen as dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or underestimating the father's role, which might be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the economic factor is mentioned, but that's not a given anymore. Many women are the primary breadwinners, and many men are primary caregivers. The author's assumption might not hold in all situations. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she values equality, and the author's response might feel dismissive of her values. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, assuming that the mother should take the primary role because of biology could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes. Even if there are biological factors, the author's conclusion that equality is impossible might be too rigid. Relationships require compromise, and the author's unwillingness to consider equal sharing, despite the challenges, could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they are making broad assumptions that don't account for the couple's potential to find a balanced approach that suits their specific situation. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid expectation, and the author's response could be seen as inflexible and reinforcing traditional gender roles.\n"
