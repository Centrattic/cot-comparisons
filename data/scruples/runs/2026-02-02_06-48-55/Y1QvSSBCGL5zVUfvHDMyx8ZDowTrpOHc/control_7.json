I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the arguments presented. The author is saying that there are biological reasons why the mother would be the primary parent, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with a man who doesn't agree to split work evenly. The author is arguing that equality isn't feasible, especially right after birth and down the line. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author is wrong. The question is about whether he's an asshole (AITA) for his stance. From a modern perspective, there's a push towards shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author is making biological arguments, but many people believe that societal roles are changing and that equality is possible with effort and communication.\n\nThe author's point about biological factors is valid\u2014like the mother needing to bond immediately and possible physical aspects post-birth. However, he's dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality, which could be seen as not valuing her perspective. Even if he's stating his views, the way he's handling the disagreement might be the problem. He's not compromising and is insisting that his way is the only way, which could be why she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nEconomic factors are mentioned, but that's a societal issue, not a biological one. Assuming the man is the breadwinner might not hold in all cases, and expecting the woman to be the primary parent ignores potential flexibility. The author's stance might be seen as rigid and not considering shared responsibilities beyond just the initial period.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend is considering ending the relationship because of this disagreement is significant. If equality is a non-negotiable for her, and he's unwilling to meet her halfway, that's a deal-breaker. His argument that it's not possible might not account for their specific situation or willingness to adapt.\n\nSo, while he's expressing his beliefs, the rigidity and dismissal of her needs could make him the asshole. He's not showing flexibility, and his argument might be based on outdated or generalized assumptions rather than their actual circumstances. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
