I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that they were discussing future plans, and the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship because of this disagreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that there are biological reasons why motherhood requires more immediate attention, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. So he's saying it's not feasible to split parenting equally. His girlfriend, on the other hand, won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nHmm, the key here might be the assumption that the author is making about roles. He's stating that there are inherent differences that make equal split impossible. But does that make him wrong? Well, some people believe in equal parenting, while others might see traditional roles as practical. However, the author's stance seems to be that the mother should be the primary parent, which might conflict with the girlfriend's desire for equality.\n\nI should consider if the author is being dismissive of her wishes. If she values equality and he's not willing to commit to that, maybe he is being inflexible. The argument is about future planning, so it's a big deal. The author's position might be based on traditional views, but the girlfriend is looking for a partnership where both contribute equally. If he's not willing to compromise or find a middle ground, that might be the issue here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that it's not possible to split evenly, but maybe he's not considering that couples can work towards equality even if there are initial biological factors. Like, maybe they can adjust over time or find ways to share responsibilities as much as possible. The girlfriend's stance is about principle\u2014she wants equality regardless of the challenges. So if the author is refusing to even try to split it 50/50, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her values.\n\nAnother angle: the author is making assumptions about roles based on gender norms. Even if there are biological factors, societal roles are changing, and many couples aim for shared parenting. By stating that it's impossible to split evenly, he might be reinforcing stereotypes. The girlfriend might feel that he's not open to alternative arrangements or that he's not supportive of her goals for equality.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument might be based on outdated or rigid views, and if the girlfriend's main issue is that he won't agree to an equal split, then he's not meeting her needs. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he's not respecting her perspective and the relationship might be incompatible on this core issue.\n"
