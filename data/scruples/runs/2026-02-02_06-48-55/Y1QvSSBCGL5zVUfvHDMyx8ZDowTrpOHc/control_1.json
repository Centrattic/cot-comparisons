I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He argues that when they have kids, they can't split responsibilities evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is the breadwinner and the woman is the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split. The author is asking if he's being an asshole or logical.\n\nFirst, I should consider the points he made. He's bringing up biological aspects, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. I know that from a biological standpoint, women do give birth and go through pregnancy, which might influence the initial bonding period. Postpartum depression and bonding are real issues, and some women need more time with the baby right after birth. But does that mean the mother has to be the primary parent? Maybe, but it's not a universal truth. There are many fathers who are primary caregivers as well, and societal roles are changing.\n\nHe also mentions economic factors, where the man is the breadwinner and the woman is the primary parent. That seems like a stereotype. Many women are the primary breadwinners now, and men take paternity leave or are primary caregivers. So maybe the author is stuck in traditional gender roles here.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with a man who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. That seems fair if she values equality. The author is dismissing her desire for equality by saying it's not possible. But is it not possible? Maybe not in the early stages, but as the child grows, things can balance out. Or maybe they can find a way to share responsibilities even if it's not 50-50 every day. The key point is about willingness to share the load and not assuming the mother must take on more.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's making assumptions based on traditional roles and not considering that both partners can negotiate and adapt. Gender roles in parenting are evolving, and expecting one parent to take on the majority isn't necessarily a given. The girlfriend is looking for a partner who is open to equality, which is a reasonable expectation. By asserting that an equal split is impossible, the author might be invalidating her needs and views on equality. So even if there are biological factors, the author could still be wrong in not being flexible or open to shared parenting responsibilities. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging the possibility of a more equal partnership despite challenges.\n"
