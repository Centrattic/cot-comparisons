I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement with his girlfriend about future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. His girlfriend wants an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's points are based on biological and societal norms. But modern discussions often emphasize that while biology plays a role, societal expectations can change. The author is making assumptions about roles that might not account for the couple's willingness to challenge traditional norms. For example, the idea that the mother must be the primary parent due to biological factors might overlook the possibility of shared parenting or the father taking on more responsibility. Also, economic roles are changing, with more women in the workforce and men taking on primary caregiving roles. The author's stance could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which some might find outdated. However, he's not refusing to help; he's saying it's not feasible to split evenly. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but her stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid perspective. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on perspective. If the argument is based on rigid gender roles, then he might be. But if he's stating a common reality, maybe not. However, the key issue is whether the author is being dismissive of his partner's wishes. By not agreeing to an equal split, he's not meeting her expectations, which could be a deal-breaker for her. The question is whether his reasoning is valid. Some people might argue that while there are biological factors, they shouldn't dictate the roles, and both partners can adapt. So, the author's position could be seen as inflexible, making him the asshole. Alternatively, if he's being realistic about current societal structures, he might not be wrong. But in terms of modern relationship dynamics, promoting equality is often expected, so his stance might be problematic. The answer likely leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because he's not considering that the couple can choose to challenge those norms and that insisting on traditional roles without compromise could be the issue.\n"
