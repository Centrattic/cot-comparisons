I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting duties. The author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother should be the primary parent. The girlfriend refuses to have kids unless the work is split evenly. Now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a biological argument, but does that justify expecting an unequal split? There's the assumption that the mother must be the primary parent due to biology. However, modern discussions often emphasize that parenting roles can be shared more equally with effort and support. The author might be reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some people find outdated. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality. If the author isn't open to the idea of sharing responsibilities equally, that could be problematic. Even if there are biological factors, it's possible to structure the partnership so that both parents contribute equally, maybe through flexible work arrangements or shared parental leave. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly might be an overgeneralization. It's possible in many cases, though it requires both parties to be committed. By not being open to that possibility, the author could be closing the door on a fair partnership. \n\nAnother angle: the author is making assumptions about postpartum bonding and maternal instincts as if they're universal and require the mother to take the primary role. But these are not absolute and can vary. Plus, the economic argument about the man being the breadwinner is also a traditional role that's changing. \n\nSo, the author's position might be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality and reinforcing stereotypes. That could be why she's reconsidering the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not being flexible and not considering that equality is achievable despite some initial challenges.\n"
