I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend regarding their future plans for having children. He argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of the biological aspects like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood that the mother will be the primary caregiver. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. His main point is that they can't split parenting duties equally. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is firm that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split. Now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the author's arguments. He's pointing out biological differences\u2014like the mother's body being involved in pregnancy and childbirth, the postpartum period, and the natural bonding. That's a factual point. Also, societal economic structures often have men as primary earners, which could influence the division of labor. He's not saying he won't help, but that the split can't be completely even. \n\nHowever, his conclusion is that she will be the primary parent. This might be a problematic assumption. Even if there are biological factors, it's important to consider that modern relationships often strive for shared responsibilities, and expecting the mother to take on more could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. She might feel that the author is dismissing her contributions or not being open to sharing the load equally, despite the biological differences.\n\nThe author's argument might come off as dismissive of her feelings or her desire for equality. Even if some aspects are beyond their control, the author's conclusion that the split can't be even might not account for their willingness to adapt and work together. Also, the economic factors he mentions are societal trends, not absolute truths. Many women are breadwinners now, and the idea that men should be the primary earners is changing. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might be presenting his view as logical, but the way it's framed could make the girlfriend feel her perspective isn't valued. He might not be recognizing that her insistence on an equal split is about fairness and mutual respect, not just an impractical ideal. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible that while his points have some validity, his conclusion that the split can't be even might not consider the effort both parties can make to adjust. The key here is whether the author is being dismissive of his partner's valid concerns. If he's not open to discussing how they can share responsibilities as much as possible, even if it's not perfectly 50/50, that could be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she sees this as a deal-breaker because she values equality highly, and the author isn't meeting her where she is on this. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that the desire for equality is valid and that the division of labor can be negotiated beyond biological factors. Even if there are inherent differences, the willingness to work towards a fair and equal partnership is crucial. The author's stance could be seen as reinforcing traditional roles rather than being open to a more equitable approach, which could be the reason why the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship.\n"
