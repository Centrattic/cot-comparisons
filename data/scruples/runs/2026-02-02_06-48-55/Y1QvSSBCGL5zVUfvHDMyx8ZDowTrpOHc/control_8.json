I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend about the division of labor once they have kids. He argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is usually the breadwinner. He says it's not possible to split the load evenly, especially right after birth. The girlfriend, on the other hand, says she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. He mentions biological differences. There's some truth that biologically, women go through pregnancy, childbirth, and have postpartum hormonal changes. These can affect bonding and recovery, which might require more of their time initially. However, modern discussions around parenting often emphasize that while there are biological factors, societal expectations and roles play a huge part too. The author also brings up economic factors, like the man being the breadwinner. But that's a traditional role that many people now challenge, as both partners often work, and it's possible for either to be the primary earner or parent.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's impossible to split parenting equally. But his girlfriend is firm in her stance that equality is a must. The question is whether he's wrong for holding that view. \n\nFrom one angle, the author is making a practical argument based on existing realities. However, the girlfriend is asserting a value-based stance that equality is non-negotiable. The problem arises in how the author frames the issue. By stating that it's \"fundamentally different\" and \"not possible,\" he might be dismissing the possibility of working towards equality through mutual effort and societal change. His argument could imply that women are inherently the primary caregivers, which might come off as reinforcing traditional gender roles rather than being open to shared responsibility.\n\nAlso, the author seems to assume that the woman will naturally be the primary parent due to biology and economics, which might not account for the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to challenge norms. The girlfriend's reaction is about her non-negotiable boundary regarding equality, which the author isn't willing to meet. In relationships, respecting each other's non-negotiables is crucial. If the author can't meet her boundary, she's justified in reevaluating the relationship, especially since having children is a major life decision that requires mutual agreement.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that economic roles are fixed. The author's point about the man being the breadwinner is a traditional view, but many couples today have both partners working or flexible arrangements. The author's stance might not consider the possibility of shared custody or other modern approaches to parenting that aim for more equality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making a logical argument based on current societal norms and biological factors, he might be in the wrong if his stance is rigid and dismissive of evolving societal values and the couple's potential to create a balanced arrangement. The girlfriend's insistence on equality is a valid personal boundary, and if he's unwilling to meet her halfway, his position could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n"
