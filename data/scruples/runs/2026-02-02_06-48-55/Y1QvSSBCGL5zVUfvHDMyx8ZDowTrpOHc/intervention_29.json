I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author argues that there are biological factors, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, that make it more feasible for the mother to be the primary parent. They also mention economic factors leading to the man being the primary breadwinner. The author believes a completely equal split isn't possible, particularly right after birth and in the long term. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an even split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are assumptions about gender roles and biology. The author is making generalizations about what mothers and fathers do, implying that these roles are fixed and based on biology. This could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some might view as outdated or limiting. The girlfriend values equality and shared responsibility, which is a valid and modern perspective.\n\nHowever, the author is making a logical argument based on their understanding of biology and economics. They might not be wrong in their assessment of current societal norms, but they might be dismissing the possibility of change or the importance of shared responsibilities. The issue here is whether it's acceptable to make such assumptions in a relationship where the partner expects equality.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their statements on the girlfriend. Even if their reasoning is logical, how it's communicated matters. If the girlfriend feels her expectations are dismissed, that could be the root of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily wrong in stating their view based on their reasoning, but they might be in the wrong for not being open to alternative perspectives and for not valuing the girlfriend's stance on equality as equally valid. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, and if the author is unwilling to consider other viewpoints, that's where the issue lies.\n"
