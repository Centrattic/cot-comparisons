I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. His conclusion is that an equal split isn't possible, so the girlfriend would be the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether his statements are valid or if they're making an assumption that's problematic. The author is making biological determinism claims\u2014saying that mothers are inherently more suited for primary parenting. But this is a point of contention because modern discussions often emphasize the importance of shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. His argument could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes that women are the default caregivers, which might be outdated or not in line with egalitarian values.\n\nHowever, the author is also pointing out practical realities: biological factors like postpartum bonding and societal economic trends. It's possible that his intention is to set realistic expectations, but his girlfriend sees this as a rejection of equal partnership. The debate here is between acknowledging biological differences vs. advocating for equality in parenting roles regardless of biology.\n\nIs the author wrong for stating his opinion? Well, everyone has their own views, but if his stance is dismissive of the possibility of shared parenting or the girlfriend's desire for equality, that could be an issue. Even if there are biological factors, modern relationships often aim to balance these with mutual effort. The author's position might not be factually incorrect, but it could be seen as not respecting his partner's expectations and values, which is a relational problem.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the girlfriend values equal partnership and the author is unwilling to consider shared parenting despite challenges, then he might be in the wrong. The question is whether his statement is a logical conclusion or a harmful stereotype. Since the girlfriend's reaction is about the relationship's future, the author's approach might be undermining her autonomy and their shared goals, making him at fault.\n"
