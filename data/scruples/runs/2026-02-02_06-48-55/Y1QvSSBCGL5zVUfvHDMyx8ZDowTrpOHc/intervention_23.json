I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The key points here are the author's argument about the biological and economic factors making it impossible to split parenting duties equally, and the girlfriend's response that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and current discussions around gender roles in parenting. The author is making a traditional argument based on biological differences, suggesting that women have maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which might require them to be the primary caregiver. He also mentions economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. However, modern perspectives often emphasize shared parenting responsibilities and challenging traditional gender roles, advocating for equality regardless of biological factors.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that equality is essential. Her response indicates that she expects an equal partnership in parenting, which is a valid and increasingly common viewpoint. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, implying that women are naturally more suited for caregiving, which can undermine the idea of equal sharing. Even if there are biological factors (like the mother needing more rest post-birth), that doesn't necessarily mean the overall workload can't be split equally over time with mutual effort and adjustment.\n\nAnother angle is the author's use of \"it's not possible\" versus the girlfriend's expectation of equality. The author might be dismissing her perspective as naive, which could be perceived as dismissive or not respecting her wishes. Effective communication in relationships involves finding common ground, and if one partner's fundamental needs (like equal parenting) are not met, it's a significant issue.\n\nAlso, the economic argument about the man being the breadwinner is a traditional view that may not apply in all cases. Many women are primary breadwinners or dual-income households exist. Assuming that the man will be the breadwinner could be part of the problem, as it reinforces outdated gender roles.\n\nSo, while the author's points might have some basis in current societal realities, the way he frames the argument could be seen as rigid and not accommodating his partner's values. The girlfriend is prioritizing equality, which is a valid stance. The author's refusal to consider shared parenting beyond initial biological factors might be the issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible and for perpetuating traditional roles.\n"
