I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are inherently different in their expectations about splitting parenting responsibilities. The author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic reasons where men are typically the breadwinners. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and the author is now considering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key point here is whether the author's stance is valid or not. The author brings up biological aspects, which some people argue are real. For example, postpartum bonding is a physical process, and the mother's body goes through changes after childbirth that might make her more inclined to be the primary caregiver. But there's also a lot of discussion around how these roles are socially constructed and how societal expectations and economic structures (like the gender pay gap) also play a role. \n\nHowever, the author's main issue is asserting that a completely equal split isn't possible. The girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The conflict arises from differing views on what's feasible and fair. The author is being logical in their view based on current realities, but the girlfriend might feel like the author is not open to change or isn't considering that gender roles can shift with effort and societal change.\n\nIt's important to consider if the author is dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality without acknowledging that both parents can share responsibilities equally through mutual effort and support, regardless of biological factors. The author might be stuck in traditional roles, whereas the girlfriend is advocating for a more modern, egalitarian approach. If the author is not open to discussing how they can work towards an equal split despite those challenges, that could be seen as inflexible or not respecting her wishes. \n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" might be too absolute. While it's true that some initial challenges are biologically based, like the need for the mother to be with the baby immediately after birth, long-term parenting can be more flexible. The author could have acknowledged those initial differences but still committed to equal sharing moving forward. By framing it as an impossibility, the author might be invalidating the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nSo, the author is making a logical argument based on existing factors but may not be considering the possibility of change or the importance of shared responsibility in the relationship. The girlfriend is setting a boundary that aligns with her values, and the author's refusal to entertain an equal split might be crossing that boundary. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting her stance and not being open to working together to find a solution.\n"
