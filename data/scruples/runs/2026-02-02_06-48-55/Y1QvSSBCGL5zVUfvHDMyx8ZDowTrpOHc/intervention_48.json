I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The guy says that motherhood and fatherhood are different, so splitting parenting duties equally isn't feasible, especially after the birth. The girlfriend reacts strongly, saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author is making a point based on biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men often earn more, leading to women being primary caregivers. He's not saying men can't be primary caregivers, but that it's more common for mothers to take that role. He's arguing that equality in workload isn't possible due to these factors.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that she won't accept unequal division. She might see equality as a non-negotiable. The author is making a generalization, but maybe he's dismissing her perspective that equality is essential. Also, even if there are biological factors, societal norms are changing, and many couples do aim for equal sharing. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the girlfriend finds unacceptable.\n\nBut is he wrong? The question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend is considering ending the relationship over this, which is a big deal. If the author is arguing from a place of logic based on current realities, but the girlfriend sees that as a refusal to be equal, then maybe he's not wrong in his reasoning. However, if he's being dismissive of her values or not considering modern perspectives where equality is achievable, that could make him the asshole.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly might be an overgeneralization. While there are challenges, many couples do manage to share responsibilities equally. The author's stance could be perceived as not being supportive of shared parenting, which is what the girlfriend wants. His argument might not account for the couple's own willingness to work together despite these challenges.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction is strong, but so are the author's convictions. If the author is unwilling to commit to an equal split despite acknowledging that it's possible in their case, then he's in the wrong. But if he's realistic about the difficulties and still open to discussion, maybe not. The key is whether he's being rigid or open-minded.\n\nThe author says there's \"no way\" to split evenly, which is an absolute statement. That could be seen as inflexible. The girlfriend is standing by her non-negotiable stance. It's a conflict of values. If the author is unwilling to compromise on his belief and the girlfriend can't accept that, then perhaps he's in the wrong for not being open to their partnership creating a different dynamic than the norm.\n\nBut maybe he's not wrong in his assessment. If he's just stating facts and not forcing her to agree, but she's not okay with that, it's a matter of compatibility. Arguably, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his views, but if he's not respecting her stance, then he is. The question is about being an asshole, not about who's right in the argument.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the subreddit often considers intent and respect. If the author is dismissive or not respecting her wishes, he's the asshole. If he's just stating his perspective and she's choosing to leave because of that, it's a difference in values. The line between being logical and being an asshole is thin here.\n\nI think the author is making valid points but the way he frames it as impossible might be too absolute. Also, assuming the girlfriend's role as primary caregiver by default could be seen as outdated. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being open to alternative arrangements or for not respecting her non-negotiable stance. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
