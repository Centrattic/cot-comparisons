I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the context again.\n\nThe author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend about fatherhood and motherhood. He argues that it's impossible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional roles where the mother is the primary caregiver. The girlfriend refuses to have kids with him if he doesn't agree to an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is making assumptions based on biology and traditional gender roles. He's saying that mothers naturally have a stronger bond and should be the primary parent, which might be a stereotype. The girlfriend is pushing for equality, which is a valid stance in modern relationships where shared responsibilities are encouraged.\n\nThe author's argument relies on biological determinism, which isn't always accurate. While there are biological differences, societal roles and individual choices play a big part. Assuming that the mother must be the primary caregiver can overlook the possibility of shared parenting or the father taking on more responsibility. It also ignores the fact that many couples successfully share parenting duties equally.\n\nThe girlfriend's position is about equality and mutual agreement, which is reasonable. The author's refusal to consider equal sharing might be seen as dismissive of her values and expectations. Even if there are biological factors, they shouldn't dictate the entire parenting arrangement. The author's stance could come off as rigid and not considering the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to adapt.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument could be seen as perpetuating stereotypes that limit both parents' roles. By not being open to an equal split, he might be undermining his partner's autonomy and the possibility of a more balanced approach. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling that her needs for equality are not being respected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like he's making assumptions based on outdated stereotypes and not being flexible. The girlfriend is asserting her right to an equal partnership. Therefore, the author's position is problematic because it doesn't account for modern views on shared parenting and may not respect his partner's desires. Hence, he's likely the asshole here.\n"
