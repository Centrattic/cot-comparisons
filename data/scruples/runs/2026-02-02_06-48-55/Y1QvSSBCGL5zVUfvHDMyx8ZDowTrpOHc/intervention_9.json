I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially regarding the division of parenting responsibilities. The author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother would need to spend more time with the child initially, and that traditional roles often have the mother as the primary caregiver. The girlfriend took offense and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is making a general statement based on biological and traditional societal roles. However, the girlfriend's response is about wanting an equal split. The key here is whether the author's statement is invalidating her perspective or making assumptions that aren't universally true.\n\nIn modern discussions, there's a push towards equality in parenting, recognizing that while there are biological differences, societal roles can be flexible. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which could be why the girlfriend is upset. By stating that an even split isn't possible, the author might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or the idea that both parents can adapt their roles regardless of biology.\n\nThe author could be seen as making assumptions about the girlfriend's role without considering her personal beliefs or the possibility of challenging traditional norms. Even if there are biological factors, the author's conclusion that an equal split isn't feasible might not account for the couple's ability to choose different roles or the evolving nature of gender roles in society.\n\nAdditionally, the author's use of phrases like \"naive about parenthood\" suggests a condescending attitude, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she values equality in parenting, and the author's stance might conflict with her values. In relationships, respecting each other's values is crucial. If the author isn't willing to consider alternative viewpoints, that can lead to conflict.\n\nSo, while the author may have a point about biological factors, the way it's presented and the assumption that traditional roles are inevitable might be where they're in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether the author's statement is seen as rigid and dismissive of the girlfriend's expectations for equality.\n"
