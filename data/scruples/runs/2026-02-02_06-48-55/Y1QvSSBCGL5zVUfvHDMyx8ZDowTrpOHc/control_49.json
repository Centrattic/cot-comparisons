I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally after having a child.\n\nThe author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men are typically the primary breadwinners, it's not possible to have an equal split. His girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. Now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is correct in his statements. He mentions biological components, which is a sensitive topic. The idea that maternal instincts or postpartum bonding require the mother to spend more time with the child is a common belief, but it's not universally accepted. Some studies show that fathers can bond similarly, though the initial bonding might be more intense for mothers. However, economic factors do play a role in who stays home, but that's more about societal structures than biological necessity.\n\nThe author's stance is that equality in parenting isn't feasible. The girlfriend's position is that she won't accept anything less than an equal split. The key here is whether the author is wrong for holding this view. The question is about being in the wrong, not just whether his argument is valid.\n\nFrom a feminist or equality perspective, the author's argument might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. He's implying that the mother is naturally the primary parent, which could be viewed as dismissive of the possibility of shared parenting or the importance of challenging gender norms. If the girlfriend is looking for a partnership where both contribute equally, the author's stance might be seen as not aligning with her values.\n\nHowever, the author is stating his perspective based on his understanding of biology and economics. If he is not being confrontational but rather explaining his belief, is he in the wrong? Or is the girlfriend overreacting because her expectations don't align with his views?\n\nIn relationships, it's possible that differing values can lead to significant conflict. If the author is unwilling to consider alternatives, like flexible sharing or challenging traditional roles, he might be at fault. But if he's just stating his position and the girlfriend is making a choice based on that, then maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the author's stance could be seen as inflexible.\n\nThe key points to consider: Is the author being dismissive of shared parenting possibilities? Are his arguments based on outdated or incorrect assumptions? If he's not open to the idea that both parents can adjust roles and share responsibilities equally, even if it's challenging, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's realistically acknowledging the current societal and biological factors, it's a more complex issue.\n\nSociety is moving towards more shared parenting, though it's still difficult for many. The author's argument might not be entirely incorrect in practical terms, but it's possible he's not accounting for the possibility of change or the importance of mutual effort beyond biological factors. The girlfriend's stance is about her non-negotiable boundary, while the author is stating his belief. If the author is unwilling to find a middle ground, that's where the problem lies. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for his initial statement, not his unwillingness to compromise.\n\nIn terms of AITA, if the author made a statement that was offensive or dismissive of his partner's values, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's just expressing his realistic perspective based on his understanding, and the girlfriend is making a choice based on that, it's more about incompatible values than one side being wrong. But the community often looks at whether the person is being respectful and considerate. If the author is not being open to alternative views or is making absolute statements without room for discussion, that could be seen as problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might swing towards the author being in the wrong if his statements are seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes or not respecting his partner's stance. However, if it's just a difference in opinion without malice, it's a matter of values. The AITA community tends to side with people who are more open to compromise and respectful of their partner's boundaries. Since the author is rigid in his position, maybe he is in the wrong.\n"
