I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. \n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not feasible to split parenting responsibilities equally, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nI need to consider the validity of the author's points. The biological aspects are a common belief, but modern discussions often challenge the idea that maternal instincts are the only or main factor. Also, the assumption that the man will be the breadwinner is a stereotype that doesn't hold true for many couples these days. The author is making generalizations that may not apply to their specific situation or future possibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality in parenting. She wants a 50/50 split, which the author is dismissing as impossible. The issue here is whether refusing to consider a balanced approach is reasonable. The author's argument could come off as dismissive of her desires and expectations. Even if there are biological factors, the author is not leaving room for negotiation or the possibility of challenging traditional roles. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships, especially when planning for major life events like parenthood. The author's statement might be seen as rigid and not open to discussion, which could lead to conflict. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she values equality, and if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway or be flexible, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the author's points might be based on outdated or biased assumptions. While it's true that postpartum care often requires more from the mother initially, this doesn't mean the father can't be equally involved afterward. Plus, many couples manage to share responsibilities equally despite these challenges. The author's stance could be seen as undermining the possibility of a partnership where both parents contribute equally.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, respecting each other's views is crucial. If the author is unwilling to acknowledge the importance of equality to his girlfriend, it's a conflict of values. He's prioritizing his logic over her emotional needs, which can be a red flag.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not engaging with his girlfriend's perspective and is using biological and economic arguments that may not fully address the complexities of their potential future. The answer is likely A.\n"
