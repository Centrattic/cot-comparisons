I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves their future child-rearing plans and differing views on equality.\n\nFirst, the author argues that splitting parental responsibilities evenly isn't feasible due to biological factors like maternal instincts and post-partum bonding, as well as economic factors where the man is often the breadwinner. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's stance is problematic. The key points here are the assumptions he makes. He's making generalizations about biological differences, which might be based on stereotypes rather than evidence. Modern discussions around parenting often emphasize that while biological factors exist, they don't necessitate a fixed role division. Many couples successfully share responsibilities, and societal norms are shifting towards more equality. The author's dismissal of the girlfriend's stance as her not understanding or being naive could come off as condescending.\n\nAlso, the author assumes that the mother should be the primary parent due to economic reasons, which might overlook the fact that many women are the primary breadwinners now, and some fathers choose to be primary caregivers. By stating that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly, he's not leaving room for negotiation or considering that both partners might adjust their careers or the couple might prioritize different values.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is about her non-negotiable boundary regarding equal partnership in parenting. The author's dismissal of her boundary as unrealistic could be seen as invalidating her needs and expectations, which is a significant issue in a relationship. Communication is key, and if the author isn't open to finding a compromise or understanding her perspective, that's a problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, while the author might be expressing a logical standpoint based on his beliefs, the way he presents it and the dismissal of his partner's valid concerns could be seen as the issue. Relationships require mutual respect and willingness to adapt. If he's not willing to consider her stance as valid, even if he disagrees, that's where the problem lies. So, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries and making assumptions based on outdated or rigid views.\n"
