I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, implying that the mother will naturally take on more responsibility for children, especially after birth. His girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split work equally.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic reasons where the man is the breadwinner. But is that valid? Well, while there are biological aspects (like pregnancy and postpartum), modern society is shifting towards shared responsibilities. The author is making assumptions about roles that might not hold true for everyone. For example, many couples now have both parents working, or the woman as the primary earner. The author's stance could be seen as traditional or even dismissive of the possibility that roles can be flexible.\n\nAlso, the author is saying it's not possible to split the work evenly. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is setting a boundary that she expects equality. The author isn't respecting her boundary by not agreeing to the equal split, even if he believes it's not feasible. This could be a deal-breaker for her because she values equality in parenting. His argument might be based on outdated stereotypes, assuming that the mother must be the primary parent, which might not reflect their actual situation or shared goals.\n\nMoreover, the author is not considering that couples can plan to share responsibilities in ways that don't rely on traditional gender roles. By refusing to commit to an equal split, he's not showing flexibility or willingness to adapt. The girlfriend is looking for a partner who is committed to shared parenting, which is a common expectation in many modern relationships. The author's rigid stance might be the issue here, making him the one in the wrong.\n"
