I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable to state that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of how parental responsibilities might be divided.\n\nFirst, the author argues that there are biological reasons why the mother might spend more time with the child immediately after birth, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. So, the author is making a case that expecting an equal split isn't realistic.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, is saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's taking a strong stance that equality is necessary, and the author's position is making her reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the validity of the author's argument and whether their stance is problematic. The author is making generalizations about biological and societal roles. But there's a lot of debate about whether these roles are fixed or if they can be more evenly shared with effort and changing societal norms.\n\nOne angle is that the author might be reinforcing traditional gender roles by assuming the mother is the primary caregiver and the father the breadwinner. This could be seen as dismissive of the idea that both parents can share responsibilities equally, especially in modern relationships where such roles are more fluid. By saying it's \"fundamentally different,\" the author might be suggesting that some inequalities are inevitable, which could be problematic if it leads to the mother shouldering more responsibility without question.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be arguing based on reality as it stands now, acknowledging that due to biological factors and current economic structures, an equal split isn't feasible. They might not be saying they won't share the load, but just that a 50/50 split isn't possible, especially initially.\n\nBut the girlfriend's stance is that she expects equality, which is a valid personal boundary. If the author is unwilling to commit to trying for an equal split despite challenges, that might be the issue. The problem could be in the communication\u2014maybe the author came off as inflexible or not acknowledging the possibility of working towards equality, even if it's not 100% possible. Or maybe the girlfriend is not open to compromise at all, but the question is about the author's accountability.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is using their argument to justify not sharing responsibilities equally rather than being open to negotiation, then they might be. But if they're just stating their realistic view and the girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values, then the author might not be the asshole. However, by dismissing the possibility of an equal split, the author could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's perspective or not being open to discussing shared parenting. That could lead to the author being in the wrong, as it's about mutual respect and willingness to negotiate in a relationship.\n\nAnother point is that the author mentions \"there's no way we will be able to split the load completely evenly,\" which is a strong statement. It might be more constructive to say that there will be challenges but both are committed to working towards equality rather than stating it's impossible. The rigidity of the author's stance might be the problem here, leading to the girlfriend feeling that her expectations aren't being met.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's position might be seen as in the wrong because it's rigid and possibly dismissive of the partner's expectations for equality, even if there are challenges. They could be using biological and economic factors as reasons not to strive for equality, which is a traditional viewpoint that some might find outdated or disrespectful in a modern context where shared parenting is increasingly normalized.\n"
