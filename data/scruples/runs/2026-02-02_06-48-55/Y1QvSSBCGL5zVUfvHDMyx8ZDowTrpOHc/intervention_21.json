I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to his girlfriend reconsidering their future. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is arguing that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and societal economic roles, the mother is more likely to be the primary caregiver. He believes a completely equal split isn't feasible. His girlfriend, however, is firm in her stance that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong in his assertion. Let's break it down. The author's points are based on biological and societal factors. However, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The girlfriend is asserting her desire for equality, which is a valid perspective in modern discussions about family roles.\n\nThe author might be making assumptions about what's possible in their relationship. While his points about current societal trends and biology have some validity, he might be underestimating the potential for change and mutual adjustment. His statement that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly could come off as dismissive of his partner's wishes, not just the reality. The girlfriend is clearly stating her non-negotiable boundary, which the author is not respecting by not acknowledging her stance as valid.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument could be seen as perpetuating traditional gender roles. Even if there are biological factors, modern relationships often aim for equality, and the willingness to work towards that is important. The author's insistence that equality isn't feasible might be seen as not valuing his partner's perspective or being unwilling to adapt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't entirely wrong to point out existing challenges. But the problem lies in how he's presenting his argument. It's not just about the facts but also about respecting mutual expectations. The girlfriend's reaction is about her personal values and boundaries, which the author is not honoring by not engaging with her perspective beyond stating his own.\n\nSo, while there's a factual basis to his argument, the way he's approaching the discussion and dismissing his partner's needs and desires makes him the asshole. The key is that in a relationship, respecting each other's non-negotiables is crucial, even if you don't agree. The author's stance here disregards his partner's fundamental requirement for equality, which is a deal-breaker for her. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
