I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when they told their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to the girlfriend reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary caregiver. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The key issue here is whether it's reasonable to claim that an equal split in parental responsibilities is impossible.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. The author is defending their position as logical, while she's seeing it as a dealbreaker. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to verify if that's correct.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and modern discussions around parenting, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author's argument assumes a fixed role based on biology and economics, which might not account for changing attitudes or the couple's own preferences. By stating that a 50-50 split is impossible, the author might be dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality, which could be a core value for her.\n\nMoreover, the author's position could be seen as inflexible. While there are practical considerations, the way the author presents their argument might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective. It's possible that the author isn't considering that the couple could work together to find a solution that meets both their needs, rather than accepting a predetermined unequal split.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is a valid expression of her values. If equality is a non-negotiable for her, then the author's refusal to compromise on this point might be the sticking point. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their logical reasoning, but in terms of relationship dynamics, failing to meet the girlfriend's expectations could indeed make them the problem.\n\nHowever, the author could argue that they are being realistic about the challenges of parenting. The question then becomes whether it's reasonable to expect a completely equal split regardless of circumstances. If the author is open to discussing and finding a middle ground, that's one thing, but if they're rigidly opposed to any equal division, that's another.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the author isn't acknowledging the girlfriend's perspective and the importance she places on equality, that could be where they're in the wrong. It's not just about who's logically right but about respecting each other's values and finding a compromise.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their stance is rigid and dismissive of the girlfriend's values, even if their reasoning has some basis in reality.\n"
