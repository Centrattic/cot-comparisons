I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother will naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, leading to the mother being the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, wants an equal split, and the author is being accused of not being open to that, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author is wrong in making these claims. The author's points are based on biological and societal norms. But modern views often emphasize equality and shared parenting, regardless of biological factors. The author might be assuming that the mother must be the primary parent, which could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend's stance is about equal responsibility, which is a valid perspective. \n\nThe author could be correct in pointing out biological differences, but framing it as an absolute split where equality isn't possible might be problematic. It could dismiss the girlfriend's desire for shared responsibility and overlook the possibility of balancing roles even with initial biological differences. Also, economic factors are changing, with more women being breadwinners, so the author's assumption might not hold in all cases. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the argument is about expecting equality despite biological factors, the author might be seen as not being supportive of equal partnership. But if the author is just stating facts about initial bonding, maybe not. However, the way it's phrased as \"no way\" to split evenly could be seen as inflexible, leading to the girlfriend feeling her wishes are ignored. \n\nI think the author is making a logical point but not considering that the girlfriend's stance is about partnership and equality. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they might be unwilling to adapt their views to support shared parenting, even if it's challenging. Alternatively, B if the biological factors are valid. But given the context of the girlfriend's reaction, maybe the author's approach is dismissive, so A.\n"
