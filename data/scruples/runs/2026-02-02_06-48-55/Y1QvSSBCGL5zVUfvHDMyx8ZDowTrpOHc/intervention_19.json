I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves their future plans for having children and splitting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the author's argument. He claims that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding make it so the mother will naturally spend more time with the child initially. He also mentions economic factors where the man is usually the breadwinner. Therefore, he thinks a completely equal split isn't possible. His girlfriend, however, is firm that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a modern perspective, the idea that women must be the primary parent due to biology is a traditional view that some people argue is outdated. It might also ignore the fact that societal roles are changing, and many people now advocate for shared parenting regardless of gender. The author's statement could be seen as making assumptions about his girlfriend's role and his own, which might be dismissive of her beliefs and desires. \n\nHowever, he's also pointing out practical realities, like biological differences and traditional economic roles. But the key issue here is whether his statement was respectful and considerate of her perspective. If he's making a generalization that undermines her stance without room for negotiation, that could be problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and compromise. By asserting that equality isn't possible, he might not be leaving space for alternative solutions or shared decision-making. The girlfriend's response is about her non-negotiable stance on equality, which is her right. The author's refusal to meet her at that point might be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reasoning might be based on outdated or reductive views, and his communication could have been more collaborative. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being open to a more flexible approach and for making assumptions about their future roles.\n"
