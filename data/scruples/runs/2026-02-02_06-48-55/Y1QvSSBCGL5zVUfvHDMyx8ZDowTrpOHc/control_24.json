I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of how parenting responsibilities might split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's argument. He's saying that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother is likely to spend more time with the child initially. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners and women the primary parents. So, he's arguing that a completely equal split isn't possible.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is insisting that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an even split. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, there's a big push towards gender equality in parenting. Many people advocate for shared responsibilities, regardless of traditional gender roles. The author's comments might come across as reinforcing stereotypes, even if he's not intending to. By suggesting that the mother should be the primary parent due to biology and economics, he might be overlooking the importance of mutual agreement and shared effort in a relationship. \n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend felt his stance dismisses her desire for equality and partnership. Even if some biological factors exist, many couples manage to share responsibilities, and the assumption that it's not possible could be seen as limiting or dismissive of her perspective. \n\nAlso, the key here is communication. If the author's intention was to set realistic expectations, but his girlfriend interprets it as a refusal to share the load, that's a miscommunication. However, if he's rigidly insisting that equality isn't possible without considering her viewpoint, he might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship because of this, it suggests that the author's comments hit a sensitive point. Even if there's some truth to the biological aspects, framing it as a given that the mother must take on more without considering mutual effort or flexibility could be seen as not respecting her values. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her stance on equality and for reinforcing traditional roles without room for compromise.\n"
