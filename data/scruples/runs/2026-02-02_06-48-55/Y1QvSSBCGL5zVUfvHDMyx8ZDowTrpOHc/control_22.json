I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of responsibilities post-birth. The girlfriend took offense and is reconsidering the relationship. The author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic factors where men are often the breadwinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's statements are based on facts or stereotypes. The author mentions maternal instincts and the need for the mother to spend more time with the child after birth. But wait, isn't that a common belief? However, modern parenting often challenges that by promoting shared responsibilities. Also, the assumption that the man will be the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent is a traditional gender role that's not universal anymore. Many couples have both partners working or different arrangements.\n\nThe author's point is that equality in parenting isn't possible right after birth or later. But the girlfriend is standing by her stance that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split work evenly. The author is defending his position as logical, while she sees it as dismissive of her values.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author is perpetuating outdated stereotypes or making a valid argument. If the author is using biological factors to justify unequal roles, that might be problematic because it reinforces gender roles. Also, the economic argument assumes that the man will earn more, which isn't always the case. Plus, the idea that equality is impossible might be too rigid; many couples manage to share responsibilities, even if not perfectly equal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out practical realities, like the biological aspects post-birth. But maybe he's oversimplifying and not accounting for the possibility of shared parenting despite those challenges. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from the author dismissing her desire for equality, which she sees as essential. If the author had said that there might be initial challenges but both would work towards equality, that might be different. But stating that equality isn't possible could be seen as not respecting her perspective.\n\nSo, the author's arguments might be based on outdated assumptions and could be contributing to a patriarchal view of parenting roles. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being open to the possibility of shared parenting and for reinforcing traditional gender roles. However, if he's just stating his honest belief based on his understanding, it's a bit of a gray area. But given the context of the girlfriend's strong reaction and the potential for the author's statements to invalidate her values, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) might be appropriate.\n"
