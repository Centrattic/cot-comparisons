I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The author says that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which might mean the mother has to spend more time with the child right after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is usually the breadwinner, leading to the mother being the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset and considering breaking up because she wants an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about gender roles in parenting and whether the author's stance is valid or problematic. The author is making generalizations based on biological and economic factors. But wait, these are stereotypes that might not hold true in all cases. For example, many couples now share parenting duties equally, and it's possible for either parent to be the primary caregiver. Also, the idea that men are the primary breadwinners is an outdated assumption, as women are increasingly in the workforce. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the girlfriend might find restrictive. \n\nThe author assumes that the mother must be the primary parent, which might not account for the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to adapt. The girlfriend is looking for equality, which the author dismisses as impossible. By not considering that they could adjust their roles beyond traditional norms, the author might be closing off a fair solution. The author's position could be seen as rigid and not respecting the girlfriend's desire for equality. \n\nSo, the author's argument is based on assumptions that may not be universally true and might not value the girlfriend's perspective. Therefore, he could be in the wrong by not being open to the possibility of shared parenting despite biological factors.\n"
