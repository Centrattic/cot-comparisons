I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend about parenting roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points the author made. He argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother should spend more time with the child, especially after birth. He also mentions economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. Based on these, he believes an equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split work evenly. The author is now worried he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, evaluating from different angles. On one hand, the author is making a case based on biological and economic realities. Some people do argue that these factors influence traditional gender roles in parenting. However, there's a shift in modern relationships where many couples aim for equality, regardless of traditional roles. The author's stance might come off as assuming the mother must take the primary role, which could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She's not just disagreeing; she's reconsidering the relationship. That suggests the issue is a deal-breaker for her. The author's position may not be inherently wrong, but it's a matter of differing values. If the author is unwilling to compromise or consider shared parenting arrangements despite her stance, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author's argument is based on assumptions that may not apply to all couples. Many people today prioritize shared responsibility, and the idea that it's impossible to split equally might be seen as dismissive of modern approaches or the couple's own preferences. The author might be underestimating the possibility of mutual adjustment and support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's reasoning isn't entirely without merit, but framing it as a non-negotiable could be the issue. The girlfriend's response is about her personal boundaries and expectations. If the author is unwilling to meet her halfway, he might be in the wrong by not respecting her perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's argument has some basis but could be seen as rigid and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Since the girlfriend's stance is about equality and the author isn't budging, he might be the one in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
