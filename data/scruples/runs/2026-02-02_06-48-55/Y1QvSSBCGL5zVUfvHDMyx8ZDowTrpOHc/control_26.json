I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend they can't split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. The girlfriend is now reconsidering the relationship because she wants an equal split. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making biological claims, suggesting that mothers naturally have a stronger bond and need to be the primary parent, especially after birth. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wants equality, which the author says is impossible.\n\nNow, thinking about current societal norms and research. There's a lot of discussion about gender roles in parenting. While it's true that biological factors like pregnancy and childbirth are unique to women, many people believe that parenting roles can be shared. Also, societal norms are shifting towards more equal sharing, even if it's not always the case. The author's argument assumes that the mother must be the primary parent, but that might be a traditional view. Some might argue that it's not biologically determined, and that both parents can adapt. Plus, economic factors are changing, with more women as primary breadwinners.\n\nThe author's statement could be seen as making a generalization, and not considering that couples can choose different arrangements. By saying it's impossible to split evenly, he might be dismissing his girlfriend's wishes and not being open to negotiation. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a common value in modern relationships. The author might be in the wrong if he's being rigid and not considering that they could work towards a more equal division despite challenges.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is presenting this as a fixed situation without room for compromise could be an issue. Even if there are biological factors, communication and flexibility are key in relationships. If the author is unwilling to meet halfway or consider other possibilities, that might make him wrong. The girlfriend's response, while strong, could be a reaction to feeling unheard or not respected in her desires for equality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be wrong if he's stating a realistic perspective based on common experiences. However, in a relationship, respecting each other's values is important. If his argument is based on outdated or rigid views, that could be problematic. So, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being open to his girlfriend's perspective and is making assumptions about their future without considering that they can work together to create a balanced approach, even if it's not 50-50 in every aspect. The key here is whether he's dismissing her valid concerns about equality.\n"
