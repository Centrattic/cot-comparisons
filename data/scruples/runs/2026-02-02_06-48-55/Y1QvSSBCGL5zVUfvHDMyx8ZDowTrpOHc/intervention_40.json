I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The key points from the author's argument are about biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors leading to the mother being the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split in parenting duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's statements are based on facts or stereotypes. The author mentions maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. These are often discussed in biological terms, but they can also be culturally influenced. There's research showing that while biological differences exist (like the mother's body during pregnancy and childbirth), modern parenting roles are increasingly shared. The author's argument might be reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some people might see as outdated or restrictive.\n\nNext, the author is making predictions about their future roles as parents. The girlfriend is clear that she doesn't want to have a child with someone who thinks an equal split isn't possible. The author's stance could be seen as dismissing her desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, it's possible to advocate for equal partnership while acknowledging those factors. The author's tone might come across as inflexible, not leaving room for mutual negotiation or adapting to changing circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption about economic factors. The author states that the man is likely the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. This is a generalization that doesn't hold true for all families. Many women are the primary breadwinners, and many fathers are the primary caregivers. The author's argument could be seen as making assumptions that don't apply to their specific situation or future circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is about her own values and expectations. If she's clear that an equal split is non-negotiable, the author's refusal to agree might be a deal-breaker for her. The author might not be in the wrong for stating their view, but they could be in the wrong for not respecting her stance. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's deal-breaker is not met, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a growing movement towards shared parenting responsibilities. The author's position might be seen as traditional or even regressive by some. However, others might argue that acknowledging biological differences is just being realistic. The key issue here is communication and whether both partners can find a middle ground. The author's approach is to state their position as a fact, which might not be the best way to approach a relationship discussion where differing views need to be reconciled.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is expressing their beliefs based on certain factors, the way they present it might not consider the girlfriend's values. If the girlfriend has made it clear that equality is a non-negotiable for her, the author's refusal to agree could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and choices in the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are not meeting her deal-breaker, even if they believe their stance is logical.\n"
