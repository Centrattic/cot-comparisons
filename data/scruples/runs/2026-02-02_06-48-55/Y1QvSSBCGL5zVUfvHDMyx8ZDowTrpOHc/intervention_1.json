I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author argues that it's impossible to split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where men are often the primary earners. The girlfriend refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading to a potential breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is about biological differences. But I need to consider if these claims are valid. Are maternal instincts and postpartum bonding purely biological? Research shows that while there are some biological factors, like hormonal changes in women postpartum, these are not absolute. Men can also bond with their children, and societal roles often influence these dynamics. The author might be generalizing and reinforcing stereotypes by assuming the mother must be the primary caregiver.\n\nNext, the economic factor. The author assumes the man will be the breadwinner, which isn't a universal truth. Many households have dual incomes or women as primary earners. By stating this as a given, the author might be overlooking modern realities and making assumptions that limit both their relationship's potential.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she expects equal splitting of work. Her refusal to have children without that agreement is her right. The author's argument could be seen as dismissing her expectations and values, which are important in a partnership. Communication in relationships requires mutual respect; if the author isn't willing to compromise or consider alternative arrangements, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the author's use of \"feeling\" the split isn't possible might be a way to avoid discussing actual solutions. Instead of being rigid, a healthy relationship involves negotiation. The author might be in the wrong for not being open to finding a way to share responsibilities as equally as possible, even if it's not 50/50. The key is willingness to work together, not insisting on an impossible 50/50 split.\n\nAnother angle: the author's statement could be perceived as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. If she values equal partnership, his argument might undermine her values, leading to the breakup. In that case, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her perspective.\n\nBut then again, if the author is trying to be realistic about the challenges, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he presents it as a non-negotiable \"fact\" without considering partnership and flexibility makes his stance problematic. Relationships require compromise, and being rigid on such a significant issue could indeed be the issue here.\n"
