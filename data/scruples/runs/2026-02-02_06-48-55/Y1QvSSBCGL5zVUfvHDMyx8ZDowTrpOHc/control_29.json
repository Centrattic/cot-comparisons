I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, especially regarding the responsibilities after a child is born. They mention things like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic factors where the man is the breadwinner and the woman is the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split in parenting duties, but the author believes it's not feasible. She's considering ending the relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's points. The author brings up biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. However, these points are a bit controversial. While it's true that biological factors like breastfeeding are unique to mothers, the idea that maternal instincts are inherently stronger or that mothers must be the primary parent due to these factors is a stereotype. Modern parenting practices often emphasize shared responsibilities, and many fathers take on significant roles as primary caregivers if they choose. Also, economic factors are changing, with more women being the primary breadwinners in some households. \n\nThe author's argument assumes that the mother must always be the primary parent, which might not align with the girlfriend's expectations of equality. She wants an equal split, which the author dismisses as impossible. The key here is whether the author is being closed-minded. By stating that a completely equal split isn't possible, the author is not considering that both parents can negotiate roles that work for them, regardless of traditional roles. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing outdated gender roles, which could be why the girlfriend is so upset.\n\nAlso, the author's response doesn't seem to acknowledge the girlfriend's perspective. Instead of finding a middle ground, the author is asserting their viewpoint as logical, which might not be the case. The girlfriend's demand for equality in parenting is valid for her, and the author dismissing that as unrealistic could be seen as not respecting her values or the possibility of adapting. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to consider communication and mutual respect. The author might not be wrong in stating their belief, but if they are unwilling to meet halfway or consider alternative arrangements, they might be contributing to the conflict unnecessarily. The situation could be resolved with more discussion about how they can both contribute equally despite different starting points. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's rigid stance and the girlfriend's valid concerns, the author might be at fault for not being flexible and for perpetuating traditional gender roles without room for negotiation. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
