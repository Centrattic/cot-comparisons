I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a conflict about splitting parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother should be the primary parent, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship because of this disagreement.\n\nI need to consider if the author's stance is valid or if it's problematic. The key points here are assumptions based on biology and traditional gender roles. The author is making generalizations about what mothers and fathers can do, which might not account for individual choices or modern societal shifts towards more equality in parenting roles. \n\nBy stating it's \"fundamentally different\" and that the mother must be the primary parent due to biology, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes. The girlfriend's position is about wanting equality, which is a valid perspective. The author might be dismissing her viewpoint by saying it's not feasible, which could be seen as not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the economic factors the author mentions are traditional but not absolute. Many women are breadwinners now, and couples choose different arrangements. The author's argument could be seen as rigid, not allowing for flexibility in their future plans. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant too. She's taking it seriously, which the author might not have anticipated. The author might not realize that insisting on a traditional role is a deal-breaker for her, which is a personal choice she has the right to make. \n\nSo, the author's logic is based on outdated or stereotypical views, which could be seen as invalidating the girlfriend's desires. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being open to alternative arrangements and for making assumptions about their future based on traditional roles.\n"
