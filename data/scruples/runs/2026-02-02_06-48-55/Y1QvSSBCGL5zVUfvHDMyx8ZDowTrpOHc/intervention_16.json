I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy is talking about future plans, specifically about having kids. He argues that they can't split parenting responsibilities evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where women often become primary caregivers. His girlfriend, however, is adamant that she won't have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that equality in parenting is not feasible, especially right after birth, and maybe long-term. The girlfriend's reaction is that this makes her reconsider the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The author is making biological and societal arguments. But are those justifications valid? Well, \"maternal instincts\" and postpartum bonding are often cited, but they're not universally accepted as absolute. There's a lot of research showing that bonding can be developed by fathers too, though maybe there are biological differences post-birth. However, the assumption that the mother must be the primary caregiver because of this seems a bit outdated. Many people now advocate for more equal parenting roles, even if the initial bonding is different.\n\nThen there's the economic factor. The author mentions that men are more likely to be the breadwinners. But that's a societal trend, not a law. Many women are breadwinners now, and some couples split income. Assuming that the woman will stay home might be based on stereotypes. The author is making assumptions about their future roles without considering their specific circumstances or desires.\n\nThe girlfriend is clear that she wants an equal split. The author is not budging, which could be problematic. If someone values equality and the other person insists it's impossible, that's a fundamental disagreement. The author might be dismissing her wishes as naive, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if there are challenges, the author isn't showing willingness to negotiate or adapt, which is key in relationships.\n\nAlso, the author's argument assumes that equality isn't possible. But maybe he's underestimating the couple's ability to work together, adjust their roles, or seek support. The fact that he's confident it's not possible might be more about his own biases than reality. \n\nIn terms of being wrong, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his partner's non-negotiable boundary. If she's clear that she won't have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, and he's unwilling to meet her halfway, he's refusing to compromise on a significant issue. That's a red flag for her, and maybe he's being inflexible or holding outdated views.\n\nBut wait, is there merit to his points? There are biological differences, but how much do they affect parenting roles? The author might be right that immediate post-birth needs might require the mother to be more present. However, that doesn't have to mean a long-term split. The author is generalizing and assuming economic roles, which is a societal issue, not a personal one. The couple could plan differently. \n\nThe key issue here is respect for each other's values. The author is not respecting his girlfriend's stance on equality, and she's not respecting his view on the feasibility. But if she's non-negotiable, and he can't meet her needs, then he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. His dismissal of her position as naive shows a lack of respect for her perspective. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
