I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong after telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is expressing his belief that when they have children, the split of responsibilities can't be completely equal. He points out biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which he thinks mean the mother will spend more time with the child right after birth. He also mentions traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. His girlfriend, however, refuses to have a child with a man who doesn't agree to an even split. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are about differing expectations regarding parenting roles. The author is making a case based on biological and societal factors, while the girlfriend is holding a different view, possibly idealizing equality. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's stating his opinion based on his understanding, but maybe he's making assumptions. For example, he assumes that the mother must be the primary parent due to biology and economics. However, modern views often emphasize shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. Also, the idea that a mother must stay home is becoming less common as more women work and share parenting duties. \n\nThe author might be dismissing his girlfriend's perspective that equality is possible or that both can take on equal roles. He might be underestimating the potential for flexibility or the existence of partners who do split responsibilities equally. By not acknowledging that his views might be outdated or based on stereotypes, he could be contributing to the problem. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. If the girlfriend's dealbreaker is the equal split, but the author doesn't see that as feasible, their fundamental values might be conflicting. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her needs or unwillingness to adapt. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing her to stay home; he's stating his belief that it's likely she would be the primary parent. But if she's clear that equality is a non-negotiable for her, then his not accommodating that could be an issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering that their expectations are incompatible. By not being flexible or open to a different model, he's not meeting her needs, which is a dealbreaker for her. Therefore, he might be the asshole here.\n"
