I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation revolves around their disagreement about future child-rearing responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child initially. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. He concludes that a completely equal split isn't feasible.\n\nHis girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split. The author feels she's misunderstanding his point or is naive, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his statements are factually correct or if they reinforce stereotypes. The author is making generalizations about maternal instincts and traditional roles. But modern society is moving towards more equality in parenting, and many couples aim for shared responsibilities regardless of traditional roles. \n\nThe author's stance might be seen as assuming traditional gender roles, which could be problematic. By stating that the mother will inevitably be the primary parent due to biology and economics, he might be dismissing the idea that couples can adapt and share roles more equally. This could be viewed as not holding progressive views on gender roles, hence being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, there's a biological aspect to motherhood, like pregnancy and postpartum, which are undeniable. But the author's conclusion that this necessitates a primary parent role for the mother might be an overgeneralization. The girlfriend's expectation of equality is valid in many modern relationships, so if the author is unwilling to commit to shared responsibilities beyond just acknowledging the initial phase, that could be an issue.\n\nSo, while there are biological factors, the author's rigid stance against any possibility of equal division later on might be the problem. The girlfriend's reaction is about valuing equality, which is a reasonable stance. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible and for reinforcing traditional roles.\n"
