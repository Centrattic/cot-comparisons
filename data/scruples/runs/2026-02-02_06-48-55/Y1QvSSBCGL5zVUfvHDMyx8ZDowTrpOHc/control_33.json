I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement with his girlfriend over future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is explaining that there are biological factors, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, that mean the mother is more likely to take on the primary parenting role. He also mentions economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. His point is that a completely equal split isn't possible, especially right after birth. The girlfriend, however, won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading to her rethinking the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's making a statement based on his beliefs about the differences between motherhood and fatherhood. But here's the thing: while there are biological factors involved in childbirth and immediate postpartum care, the idea that roles have to be split unevenly is a societal construct that's been challenged in recent times. Many modern relationships aim for shared parenting, with both parents contributing equally in different ways. The author is assuming that the mother must be the primary parent, which could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, even if there's some biological basis.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is standing by her principle that equal work is necessary. If she can't accept any unequal distribution, maybe she's being rigid, but her stance is about equality. The author's argument might overlook the possibility of flexible, evolving roles where both parents adapt rather than defaulting to a traditional structure. Also, economic factors aren't set in stone; both partners can choose roles based on their circumstances, not just societal norms.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement is a reasonable discussion point or if it's dismissive of the girlfriend's values. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, he might be closing the door on compromise. The girlfriend's reaction is about her non-negotiable stance on equality, which the author's argument contradicts. So, even if there are biological factors, the author's refusal to consider alternative models (like shared parenting beyond just splitting time equally) could be seen as inflexible.\n\nIn modern contexts, many people argue that while there are biological differences, the emotional and practical roles can be shared more equally. The author's insistence on the traditional model might be seen as not respecting his partner's desire for equality. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that roles can be more balanced through mutual effort, even if some aspects are different. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's reinforcing traditional gender roles and not being open to his partner's values.\n"
