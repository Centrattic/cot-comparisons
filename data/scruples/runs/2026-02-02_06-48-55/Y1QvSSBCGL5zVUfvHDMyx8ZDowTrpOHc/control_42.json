I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a disagreement about future parenting roles. The girlfriend is now reconsidering the relationship because she expects an equal split, while the author believes it's not feasible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother can't split things evenly. They mention economic factors where the man is the breadwinner, making the woman the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and isn't okay with the author not agreeing, leading her to consider breaking up.\n\nHmm. The key points are whether the author is wrong for stating their perspective. The author isn't saying they won't help; they're saying an equal split isn't possible. But maybe the issue is the assumption that the split can't be equal. Are those assumptions based on outdated or harmful stereotypes?\n\nLike, the idea that women are naturally more suited to be primary caregivers might be a traditional view that ignores modern realities where parents can share roles more equally. Also, assuming the man will be the breadwinner is a traditional gender role. The author might be reinforcing gender stereotypes by not considering that both partners can adjust their careers or that the woman could choose to work, or that the man could take on more childcare.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that equality is a non-negotiable, which is valid for her. If the author refuses to even consider a more equal approach, that could be problematic. But the author is stating a realistic view based on existing challenges. However, maybe the real issue is the author's unwillingness to be flexible or to challenge the existing norms. The author might be dismissing the girlfriend's valid desire for equality, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: the author's argument is about practicality, but maybe the girlfriend is looking for a commitment to try for equality despite challenges. The author might be framing it as an absolute impossibility, whereas it's more about effort and societal structures. If the author is dismissive of her values, that's a problem.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the author is making assumptions based on gender roles and not being open to alternative arrangements, that's probably where they're in the wrong. The question is whether stating that equality isn't possible is a valid position or if it's perpetuating stereotypes. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're relying on traditional gender roles and not being supportive of the girlfriend's stance on equality, which is a significant deal-breaker for her.\n"
