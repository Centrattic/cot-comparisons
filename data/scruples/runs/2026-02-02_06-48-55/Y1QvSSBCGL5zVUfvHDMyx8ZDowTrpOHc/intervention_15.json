I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asserting that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. \n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic reality where men are often the primary breadwinners make it impossible to split parenting duties equally. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author is making a point based on biological and societal factors. But is that a valid assumption? For instance, the idea of maternal instincts and postpartum bonding being reasons for the mother to spend more time with the child is a traditional view, but modern discussions often challenge that, emphasizing that both parents can bond and that roles can be flexible. The economic aspect is also a societal norm, but many couples now share financial responsibilities or choose different arrangements.\n\nThe author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split responsibilities equally might be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's belief in equality. Even if there are biological factors, the author's phrasing could come off as inflexible and not considering alternative arrangements. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid personal value. If the author is unwilling to consider shared parenting or flexible roles, that might be where the issue lies.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship. If the author's position is rigid and doesn't allow for compromise, that could be problematic. Healthy relationships require negotiation and mutual understanding. By not acknowledging that they can work together to find a balanced solution that suits their specific situation, the author might be seen as not valuing his partner's perspective.\n\nMoreover, the author's argument relies on generalizations. Not all mothers want to be primary caregivers, and not all fathers are the primary breadwinners. Assuming that these roles are fixed could be the root of the problem. It's possible that both partners could take on different roles or find a middle ground, but the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to be equal might be too absolute.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are biological and societal factors to consider, the way the author presented his argument might have dismissed his partner's values and overlooked the possibility of collaboration and flexibility. This could lead to the perception that he's not in the right, especially if he's unwilling to adapt or find a compromise.\n"
