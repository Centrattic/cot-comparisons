I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is talking about their disagreement with their girlfriend over the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally. The main points are that the author believes motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, and that the mother is more likely to be the primary parent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making a case based on biological and economic factors. They're saying that because of things like postpartum bonding and economic realities (men as breadwinners), the mother would naturally be the primary parent. However, the girlfriend's stance is that equality is essential, and if he can't commit to that, she doesn't want to be in a relationship with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author's argument is based on assumptions that may not be universally true. For example, the idea that maternal instincts are stronger or that the mother should be the primary parent is a traditional view that has been challenged by modern discussions about gender roles and shared parenting. There's also the economic factor, which can vary depending on the couple's circumstances. Not all families fit into the traditional breadwinner model. Some women are primary earners, and some men are primary caregivers. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing outdated stereotypes rather than considering the couple's specific situation.\n\nMoreover, the author's conclusion that an equal split is impossible might be too rigid. While it's true that some aspects like pregnancy and immediate postpartum care are biologically female-specific, many other aspects of parenting can be shared. The author is dismissing the possibility of shared responsibility beyond the initial stages, which could be seen as inflexible. The girlfriend is setting a boundary that aligns with her values of equality, and the author is not meeting her expectation, which is a valid reason for her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have considered that their stance could be perceived as dismissing the girlfriend's values or not taking her concerns seriously. If the girlfriend values equality and shared responsibility, the author's argument could come across as undermining her perspective, even if their reasoning is based on certain assumptions.\n\nIn terms of societal progress, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author's perspective might be seen as traditional and not in line with modern expectations of equality in relationships. This could contribute to the girlfriend feeling that her views are not respected.\n\nHowever, the author could argue that they are being realistic about biological factors. But realism doesn't always equate to being right in a relationship context. Relationships require compromise and mutual respect for each other's values. If the girlfriend's non-negotiable is equal parenting, and the author's stance is that it's not feasible, then there's a fundamental disagreement. The author might need to reflect on whether their argument is based on genuine feasibility or traditional biases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position is based on assumptions that may not hold in all cases and could be reinforcing stereotypes. By not being open to the possibility of shared parenting beyond initial stages, they might be in the wrong in this situation. The girlfriend's decision to reevaluate the relationship is a response to a core value mismatch, which is a legitimate reason for her to take that step. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
