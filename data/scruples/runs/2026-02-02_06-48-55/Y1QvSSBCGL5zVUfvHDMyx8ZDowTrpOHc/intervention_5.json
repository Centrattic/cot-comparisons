I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's points include biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which he argues require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. His girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, but he thinks it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the assumptions here. The author is making several generalizations. For example, he assumes that maternal instincts are stronger than paternal ones, which is a common belief but not universally accepted. Some research suggests that both parents can develop strong bonds with their children, and maternal instincts aren't exclusive. Also, the idea that the mother is the primary parent due to economic factors is a traditional view that doesn't account for changing societal norms where both partners might work, or fathers take on more parenting roles.\n\nAnother point is the assumption about the postpartum period. While it's true that physically, the mother has just gone through childbirth, which requires recovery time, this doesn't necessarily mean she must be the primary parent. Partners can share responsibilities, and fathers can be involved in caregiving from the start. The author might be underestimating the capacity for shared parenting or the support systems available.\n\nThe author's statement that a completely equal split isn't possible could be seen as dismissive of his partner's perspective. His girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is valid. By not acknowledging her viewpoint and instead presenting his own as the only logical one, he might be closing off dialogue. Communication is key in relationships, especially when discussing future plans. Insisting on a traditional model without considering her desire for equality might come off as inflexible.\n\nAlso, the author's argument could be based on outdated gender roles. The idea that men are the breadwinners and women the primary caregivers is becoming less prevalent. Many couples now aim for a more balanced approach, sharing both financial and parenting responsibilities. By not being open to this possibility, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes that his partner finds unacceptable.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it depends on the context. If the couple had previously discussed and agreed on shared parenting, then his stance might be a breach of that agreement. However, the question is more about the reasoning. The author is stating his beliefs, but the problem arises if he's unwilling to consider alternatives or communicate effectively. The girlfriend is clear about her needs, and if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway, that could be seen as the issue.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's assumptions might be based on traditional views that don't account for modern realities or his partner's values. By not engaging with her perspective and insisting on his own, he's likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
