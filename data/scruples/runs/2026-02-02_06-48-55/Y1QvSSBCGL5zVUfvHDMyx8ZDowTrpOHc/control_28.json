      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in childcare responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting that mothers naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, making it more feasible for the mother to be the primary parent. He's saying that an equal split isn't possible because of these reasons.\n\nHis girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's now reconsidering the relationship because of this disagreement. The author is asking if he's the asshole here or if he's being logical.\n\nNow, I need to consider the societal context. Traditionally, women have been seen as the primary caregivers due to biological reasons, but modern views often emphasize equality in parenting. The idea that roles should be more equal is part of a broader movement towards gender equality. However, the author is pointing out practical realities that might make equal sharing difficult, especially in the early stages.\n\nBut wait, the author's argument assumes that these roles are fixed and that the mother must take on more responsibility. Is that an outdated view? Many people now argue that while biology plays a role, societal structures and personal choices can influence these dynamics. For example, fathers can also bond with their children, and there's increasing support for paternity leave and shared parenting. The economic factor he mentions might also be changing, as more women are in the workforce and dual-income households are common, which can allow for more flexibility.\n\nThe author's stance might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some might view as the problem. If the girlfriend is looking for a more equal partnership, then the author's insistence on a different division could be a deal-breaker for her. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in his expectations versus the girlfriend in hers.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the mother must stay home. The author states that it's more likely feasible for the mother to be the primary parent due to biological and economic factors. But this might not be a given for every couple. Some couples choose different arrangements, and the author is not leaving room for negotiation or considering that both parents could adjust their roles in a way that's equitable even if not identical. The term \"completely even\" might be too rigid; maybe the girlfriend is looking for a fair split, not a 50/50 split.\n\nAlso, the author is asserting that it's impossible to split evenly, but maybe he's overgeneralizing. There are many couples who manage shared parenting, so his argument might not hold in all cases. By refusing to consider alternatives, he might be dismissing his partner's perspective as naive, which could be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. If being the asshole means being unreasonable or dismissive, then maybe the author is. Even if there are biological factors, the key issue is mutual respect and willingness to find a solution that works for both partners. Insisting that equality isn't possible without room for compromise could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's values or priorities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position might be based on outdated or inflexible views, and by not acknowledging that there are other ways to approach parenting (like flexible roles or challenging traditional norms), he's not being supportive of his partner's stance. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
