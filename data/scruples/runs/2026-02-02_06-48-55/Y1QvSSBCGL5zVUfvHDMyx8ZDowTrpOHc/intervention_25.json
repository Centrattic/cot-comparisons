I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He argues that when they have kids, they can't split the responsibilities evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the fact that women often become the primary caregiver due to these factors and economic reasons where the man is the breadwinner. His girlfriend, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is considering ending the relationship if he won't agree to that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is making assumptions about the roles in parenthood. He's stating that it's not possible to split equally because of biology and economics. But is that a valid assumption? Well, biology does play a role\u2014pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding. But modern parenting often challenges traditional roles. Many couples do split responsibilities equally, even if it takes effort and negotiation. The author is generalizing and maybe underestimating the possibility of shared parenting. \n\nHe's also bringing up economic factors, assuming the man would be the breadwinner. But that's a stereotype. Many women are the primary earners now, and dual-income households are common. Assuming that the man will be the breadwinner might not be fair or accurate.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about not wanting to have a child with someone who doesn't commit to an equal split. That's her non-negotiable. The author is arguing that it's impossible, which might be a way to avoid committing to her terms. \n\nIs the author being logical or making excuses? If they're planning to have a child, they need to agree on parenting roles. The author's position might be based on outdated notions of gender roles. Even if there are biological factors, there's also a choice and societal change happening. The author's refusal to consider an equal split could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's needs and expectations.\n\nThe key here is that the girlfriend's boundary is clear: she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split work equally. The author is not meeting her boundary, which is a deal-breaker for her. Whether he's right or not, respecting her wishes is crucial here. If he truly believes equality isn't possible, but she can't accept that, their fundamental disagreement might make the relationship unsustainable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Possibly. He might be making assumptions based on stereotypes rather than being open to negotiation. Even if some aspects are biological, they can still work towards equality with effort. His stance might be inflexible and not considering her perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her non-negotiable condition and perhaps relying on outdated gender roles.\n"
