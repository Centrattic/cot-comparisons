I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, emphasizing biological factors and the likelihood of the mother being the primary parent due to maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main points are about the biological realities and societal norms that might make it harder for parents to split responsibilities equally. He's stating his perspective based on what he sees as logical and practical considerations. On the other hand, the girlfriend is asserting her expectation of equality in parenting, which is a valid stance for many people, especially in modern relationships where shared responsibilities are valued.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his statements are dismissive or invalidating of his partner's feelings and expectations. Even if there are biological factors, the author's argument might come across as assuming that the mother will naturally take on more, which could undermine the partner's desire for equality. It's possible that the author isn't acknowledging that while there are biological aspects, societal roles and personal choices can influence parenting dynamics. Moreover, expecting equality in parenting doesn't mean ignoring individual circumstances but rather committing to work towards a fair, though not necessarily equal, split based on mutual agreement and flexibility.\n\nThe author might be seen as making a generalization that doesn't account for the possibility of partnership and shared parenting. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, he might be closing the door on collaborative problem-solving. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that she values a partnership where both contribute, even if it's not a 50-50 split all the time. The author's approach could be perceived as inflexible, not considering that both parents can adapt and take on roles that suit them best while aiming for equity.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of his statement on the relationship. By not validating her perspective, the author may have caused hurt feelings and led to her reconsidering the relationship. Even if his points are logically sound, the way he presented them might lack empathy and consideration for her expectations. Healthy relationships require communication and compromise, and this situation seems to be a breakdown in that area.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being realistic about the challenges of parenting and isn't in the wrong for expressing his views. But the issue here is whether his expression of those views was respectful and open to discussion. If he's presenting his stance as an absolute without room for her perspective, that could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive of his partner's needs and expectations, leading to the conclusion that he is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
