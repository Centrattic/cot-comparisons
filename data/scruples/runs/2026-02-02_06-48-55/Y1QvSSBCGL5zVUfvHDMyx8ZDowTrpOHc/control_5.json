I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about how childcare responsibilities will be split if they have kids.\n\nThe author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner. They believe it's impossible to split parenting duties equally, especially right after the child is born. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. Biologically, the mother does carry the child and typically gives birth, which involves physical and hormonal changes that can affect bonding. Postpartum is a critical time where the mother's body is recovering, which might make it harder for her to immediately return to work. However, these factors don't necessarily mean the mother must be the sole primary parent. Many modern families share responsibilities, and societal norms are changing regarding parental roles.\n\nThe author's argument also assumes traditional gender roles where the man is the primary breadwinner. This might not reflect the reality for many couples today, where both partners work or the woman earns more. The author's stance could come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's views on equality and shared responsibility, especially if she expects a more equitable approach regardless of traditional roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is about setting a boundary based on her expectations. If she values equality and sees the author's position as a refusal to share responsibilities, then her reconsidering the relationship is a personal decision based on her values. The key here is whether the author's perspective is reasonable or if they're being dismissive of her needs.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the biological arguments have some merit, but the author might be overgeneralizing and not accounting for flexibility. The statement that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly could be seen as rigid and not considering the possibility of shared parenting arrangements. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't open to compromise or modern approaches to parenting. The author's refusal to consider an equal split as feasible might indeed be the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be realistic about biological and economic factors. They might believe that acknowledging these factors is necessary for a realistic plan. However, framing it as a non-negotiable might be the problem. The girlfriend's stance is about her non-negotiable boundary, which is her right.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable and if they considered their partner's perspective. The author brings up valid points but might not be listening to the girlfriend's perspective on equality. If the author is unwilling to explore ways to share responsibilities despite the challenges, that could make them the asshole. The key is whether the author's position is inflexible and dismissive of the girlfriend's needs.\n"
