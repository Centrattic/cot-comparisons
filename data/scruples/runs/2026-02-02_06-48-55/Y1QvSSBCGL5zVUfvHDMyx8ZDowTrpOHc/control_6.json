I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend regarding future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not possible to split parenting responsibilities equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where the man might be the breadwinner. His girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's points are based on biological and traditional gender roles. But modern discussions often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of biology. The key question is whether the author's stance is wrong. \n\nThe author's statement that an equal split isn't possible might come across as assuming the woman should be the primary caregiver, which could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. Even if there are biological factors, many people argue that both parents can share responsibilities equally with effort and support. The girlfriend's response is about her personal boundary, valuing equality. \n\nIs the author being logical or making assumptions? By stating that the mother will naturally be the primary parent, he might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or the father taking on more post-birth roles. This could be perceived as not considering modern family dynamics where both parents share equally, regardless of biological factors. \n\nSo, the author's perspective might be seen as the problem here because it's based on assumptions about gender roles rather than a flexible approach. His girlfriend is standing by her boundary, and if he's unwilling to meet her halfway, that could make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
