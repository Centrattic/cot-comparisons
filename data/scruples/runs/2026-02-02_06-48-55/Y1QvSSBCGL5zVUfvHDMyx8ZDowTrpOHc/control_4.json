I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The main points are about the biological aspects like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the practical realities of the mother being the primary caregiver. The girlfriend is upset because she expects an equal split, but the author argues it's not feasible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being reasonable. The author's argument is based on biological and societal factors. However, there's a nuance here. Just because there are general trends doesn't mean that equal sharing isn't possible or desired. The author might be making a generalization that overlooks the possibility of shared parenting or that these biological factors are absolute. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. The author's response could be seen as dismissive of her viewpoint. Even if some of the author's points are technically true (like the immediate postpartum period), the way it's presented might come across as rigid or not open to negotiation. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that \"there's no way\" to split the load evenly could be problematic. It might not account for couples' ability to adapt and make choices based on their specific circumstances. The author might be oversimplifying the situation, not considering that roles can be flexible or that societal norms are changing. \n\nMoreover, communication is key in relationships. The author might not have framed their argument in a way that's respectful of the girlfriend's desires. Instead of stating it as an absolute, maybe discussing possibilities and being open to compromise could have been better. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has some valid points about biological factors, the absolutist stance and potential dismissal of the partner's values could be seen as the issue here. The answer might lean towards the author being at fault (A) because they didn't leave room for alternative arrangements or show enough flexibility in their argument.\n"
