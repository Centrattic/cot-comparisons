I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about the division of labor when they have children.\n\nThe author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors leading to the man being the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. The girlfriend refuses to have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading to the author considering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's points. The claim that biological differences make equal splitting impossible is a key point. However, this argument relies on stereotypes and may not account for modern societal shifts and individual choices. For example, many couples do split parenting responsibilities evenly, and societal norms are changing regarding gender roles in parenting. The author's stance assumes a traditional gender role that might not be applicable in their context.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the girlfriend must be the primary parent due to biology and economics. This overlooks the possibility of shared parenting or other arrangements. The author might be dismissing their partner's perspective and her desire for equality, which could be a significant issue in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equal partnership, which is a valid expectation in a modern, egalitarian relationship. By asserting that equal split isn't possible, the author might be invalidating her needs and priorities. This could lead to the conflict the girlfriend mentioned, where she rethinks the future with him.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument relies on statistical or general trends rather than their specific circumstances. The key issue here is communication and mutual understanding. The author might not be considering that the girlfriend's request for equality is non-negotiable for her, which is a personal and valid boundary.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a growing emphasis on equal parenting. The author's position might be seen as clinging to outdated notions, which could be the root of the conflict. Even if there are biological factors, they don't have to dictate the entire dynamic of the relationship. The couple could discuss and find a solution that works for both, rather than one dismissing the other's stance as unrealistic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's refusal to consider an equal split and his reliance on traditional gender roles might be the reason for the conflict. The girlfriend's position is about wanting equality, which is a legitimate expectation. By not being open to this, the author could be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
