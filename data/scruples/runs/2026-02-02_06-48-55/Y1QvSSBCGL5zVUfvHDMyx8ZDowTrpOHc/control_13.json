I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The argument centers around the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally, especially right after a child is born.\n\nFirst, the author points out biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which they argue require the mother to spend more time with the child initially. They also mention societal and economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners and women the primary caregivers. The author's stance is that an equal split isn't possible, which the girlfriend disagrees with, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the core issue here is the assumption that certain roles are inherently assigned to mothers due to biology and tradition. While there are biological differences in the immediate postpartum period (like breastfeeding, which is a physical requirement), the author is generalizing this to all aspects of parenting. They're suggesting that societal norms and economic factors make it inevitable for the mother to be the primary parent, which might not account for changing societal norms or the couple's own intentions to challenge those norms.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants an equal split, which is a valid personal preference. The author's argument could be seen as rigid, not allowing for flexibility or the couple's own choices to define their roles. Even if there are biological factors, the author is dismissing the possibility that they could choose to share responsibilities differently, perhaps adjusting for each other's circumstances or making conscious efforts to balance the load regardless of traditional roles.\n\nThere's also the aspect of gender roles here. The author is reinforcing traditional views that women are more suited for primary parenting, which might overlook the fact that many couples today are striving for equality. The argument could come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective and her desire for equality, which is a significant issue in the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's viewpoint is based on assumptions that might not hold in all cases and could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's values. The key here is whether the author is being inflexible and not considering the possibility of shared parenting beyond traditional roles, which could make them the one in the wrong.\n"
