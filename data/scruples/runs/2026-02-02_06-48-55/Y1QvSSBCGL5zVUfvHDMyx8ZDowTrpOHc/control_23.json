I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The argument is about future child-rearing plans.\n\nFirst, the author is making a point about biological differences, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, leading to the mother needing to spend more time with the child initially. They also mention economic factors where the man is the breadwinner. The girlfriend rejects this, saying she won't have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's now reconsidering the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author wrong? The author's stance is based on biological and practical reasons, while the girlfriend expects equality. The key here is whether the author's argument is valid or if it's making unreasonable assumptions.\n\nI should consider if the author is being closed-minded. Even if there are biological differences, the author is dismissing the possibility of sharing responsibilities equally, which could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's expectations. Also, assuming economic roles (man as breadwinner) might be based on outdated stereotypes. The author might not be open to modern approaches where both parents work and share duties as much as possible. The girlfriend wants equality, which is a valid stance, and the author's refusal to see that might make him the asshole. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
