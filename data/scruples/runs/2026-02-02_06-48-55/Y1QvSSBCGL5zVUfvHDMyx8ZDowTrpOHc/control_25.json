I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to unequal parenting loads. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, the author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors, the mother will naturally be the primary parent, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend disagrees, saying she won't have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the arguments. The author's points are based on biology and traditional economic roles. However, modern views often challenge these traditional roles, emphasizing shared responsibility regardless of biology. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective, especially as more people advocate for equal parenting roles.\n\nThe key issue here is whether biological factors inherently require unequal roles. While there are biological differences (like pregnancy and postpartum), societal norms and personal choices play a big role. The author assumes that economic factors will make the man the sole breadwinner, which isn't always the case. Many couples have dual incomes or choose different arrangements.\n\nThe author's argument might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if some aspects are biological, the author isn't accounting for the possibility of shared responsibilities beyond the initial period. The girlfriend's stance is about mutual agreement, which is reasonable. The author's refusal to consider an equal split, despite acknowledging biological factors, could be seen as inflexible or traditional, which might not align with the girlfriend's expectations for a partnership.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The author's approach might have been perceived as rigid, not allowing room for negotiation or adaptation. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid response to feeling that her perspective isn't respected. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being more open to shared parenting despite biological factors. The answer is A.\n"
