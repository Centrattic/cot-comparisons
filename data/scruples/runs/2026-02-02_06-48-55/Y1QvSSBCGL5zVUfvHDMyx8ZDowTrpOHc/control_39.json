I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement with his girlfriend about splitting parenting responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and societal economic roles, the mother will naturally take on more responsibility, especially after birth. He thinks an equal split isn't feasible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship because of this.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's statements are factually accurate or if they're perpetuating stereotypes. Biological differences exist, like pregnancy and childbirth, but the idea that maternal instincts require the mother to spend more time is more of a societal norm rather than a biological necessity. Also, the economic assumption that the man is the breadwinner is a traditional role that's changing, and many couples now share financial responsibilities or have different arrangements.\n\nThe author's argument seems to rely on traditional gender roles. By stating that it's \"fundamentally different\" and that the mother must be the primary parent, he might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or challenging the traditional roles. His girlfriend's stance is about equality and mutual agreement, which is valid. If he's rigid in his stance without considering flexibility or shared responsibility, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, asserting that equality isn't possible might come across as not respecting her wishes or not seeing partnership in parenting. Even if there are initial biological differences, over time, parents can adapt and share responsibilities more equally. The author's position could be seen as inflexible, leading to the girlfriend feeling her needs aren't heard.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong by not being open to a more equal partnership despite biological factors, and by reinforcing stereotypes. Therefore, answer A.\n"
