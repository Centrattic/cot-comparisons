I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asserting that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother should spend more time with the child initially. They also mention societal and economic factors where men are typically breadwinners and women primary caregivers. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is rethinking the relationship because of the author's stance.\n\nNow, considering the author's points, they're making generalizations based on biology and societal norms. But there's a big assumption here that these roles are fixed. Modern views often emphasize that parenting roles can be flexible and that both parents can share responsibilities regardless of traditional gender roles. The author might be underestimating the possibility of shared parenting or the willingness of the mother to also take on a breadwinner role.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. She might feel that the author is not committed to partnership in parenting. The author could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes rather than being open to shared responsibilities. Even if biological factors exist, they don't have to dictate the division of labor in a relationship. The author's refusal to consider an equal split could be perceived as dismissive of her values and partnership.\n\nMoreover, asserting that a 50/50 split is impossible might be the author's way of avoiding the shared effort required in parenting. It's also worth considering that societal changes are happening, with more dual-income households and shared parenting becoming more common. The author's rigid stance might not account for the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to adapt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have valid points about current societal trends, their position could be seen as inflexible and not respecting the girlfriend's desire for equality. This could lead to the perception that the author is in the wrong, as they're not open to negotiation or modern parenting approaches.\n"
