I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting that the mother will inevitably be the primary parent, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading to her reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the validity of the author's points. The author mentions biological components such as maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. While there are biological differences between men and women, like pregnancy and childbirth, the idea that maternal instincts are so strong that they necessitate a primary role is outdated. Modern research shows that bonding and caregiving are not exclusive to mothers and can be developed by fathers as well. Also, the economic factors the author mentions, where men are typically the breadwinners, are based on traditional gender roles that are increasingly changing. Many women are now primary breadwinners, and many fathers take on primary caregiving roles.\n\nNext, the author assumes that because of these biological and economic factors, an equal split is impossible. But this overlooks the importance of choice and mutual agreement in a relationship. The girlfriend is asserting her desire for equality, which is a valid stance. The author's argument could be seen as dismissing her perspective and not valuing her viewpoint on equality in parenting. It's also possible that the author is making generalizations that don't apply to all situations.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being dismissive of his partner's wishes. The girlfriend is clear about her non-negotiable stance on equal parenting. The author is arguing against that based on assumptions that may not hold in their specific case or future circumstances. If a couple can't agree on such a fundamental issue, it's a significant point of contention. The author's position might be based on traditional views, but in a modern context, expecting equality is reasonable, and the author's refusal to consider that flexibility could be the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that \"there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split\" is a strong claim. It dismisses the possibility of compromise or adjusting their situation to achieve a more balanced approach. Parenting roles can be shared more equally with effort and communication. The author's stance seems rigid, not allowing for the possibility that both parents can adapt and share responsibilities, regardless of initial biological factors.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's argument relies on outdated or overly simplistic views of gender roles in parenting. By not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and dismissing his partner's insistence on equality, the author is likely in the wrong. The girlfriend is asserting her needs, which the author is not respecting by maintaining his position as a deal-breaker. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
