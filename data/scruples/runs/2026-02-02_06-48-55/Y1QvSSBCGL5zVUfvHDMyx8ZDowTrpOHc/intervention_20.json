I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend about equal parenting. \n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother will naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. His main point is that a completely equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's now reconsidering the relationship, which makes the author question if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and gender roles, the author's statement reflects traditional views that women are the primary caregivers. However, modern perspectives emphasize equality and shared responsibilities, regardless of biological factors. The assumption that the mother must be the primary parent due to biology or economics might overlook the importance of mutual agreement and flexibility in a relationship. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's assertion that equality is impossible. While there are biological differences, the argument dismisses the possibility of working around them. The girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid and growing societal expectation. The author's refusal to acknowledge that equality is achievable, regardless of initial challenges, could be seen as inflexible. \n\nAdditionally, the author's focus on traditional roles might not consider that both partners can adapt. For example, shared parenting can be structured in ways that accommodate both biological and economic factors without assuming the mother must take on more. The author's position might come across as dismissive of his partner's desires and values, which is a significant relationship issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are biological aspects to motherhood, the author's rigid stance and failure to recognize the potential for equality in parenting responsibilities might make him the asshole in this scenario. The girlfriend's decision to reconsider the relationship is a valid response to his unwillingness to meet her expectations for equality.\n"
