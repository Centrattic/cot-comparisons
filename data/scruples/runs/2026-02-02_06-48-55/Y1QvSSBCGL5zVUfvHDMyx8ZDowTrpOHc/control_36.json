I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split in parenting responsibilities, but the author argues it's not possible due to biological factors and traditional roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author mentions biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which they believe make the mother the primary caregiver. They also bring up economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is rethinking the relationship because of this disagreement.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about assumptions regarding gender roles. The author is making claims about inherent biological differences that lead to unequal parenting roles. However, contemporary views often emphasize that while there are biological aspects, societal norms and personal choices also play a significant role. The idea that it's \"fundamentally different\" might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some might find outdated or restrictive.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that a completely equal split isn't possible might be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, modern discussions often highlight that both parents can adapt and share responsibilities, challenging the notion that the mother must be the primary caregiver. The author's position could be viewed as not respecting the girlfriend's perspective or her agency in making choices about her role as a parent.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assertion that economic factors typically make the man the breadwinner is a generalization that doesn't account for changing dynamics where women are often primary earners, or couples share financial responsibilities. This could come off as assuming traditional roles without considering their own circumstances or the possibility of flexibility.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author might have approached the discussion without considering how their partner's values of equality might affect the conversation. Instead of meeting her where she is, they might have focused on what they see as the reality, which could be perceived as dismissive rather than collaborative.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's argument is based on assumptions that may not align with the girlfriend's values of equal partnership. Even if there are biological factors, the way the author presented their case might have been seen as not valuing the partner's perspective. Therefore, the author's stance could be considered as being in the wrong because they're reinforcing traditional roles and not being open to the possibility of shared parenting despite differences.\n"
