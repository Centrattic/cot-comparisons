I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for stating that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. The girlfriend is now reconsidering the relationship because she wants an equal split, while the author argues it's not feasible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author points out biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary caregiver due to societal and economic factors. He's saying that splitting the load evenly isn't possible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split regardless of these factors.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is wrong to make such a statement. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, suggesting that roles should be divided based on traditional gender roles might be seen as reinforcing outdated stereotypes. Even if there are biological factors, many modern relationships aim for equality despite those factors. The author might be dismissing his partner's desire for shared responsibility, which could be seen as not respecting her autonomy or modern values.\n\nHowever, the author is also pointing out practical realities. There's a biological aspect to motherhood, like pregnancy and postpartum, which can make it more feasible for the mother to be the primary caregiver initially. But the author might be overgeneralizing or not considering that societal norms are changing, and many fathers do take on significant primary care roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid position. The author's argument could be seen as rigid, not leaving room for flexibility or mutual decision-making. It's possible that the author's statement comes off as dismissive of her wishes, leading her to question the future of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, while the author is stating a perspective based on real factors, the way he presents it could be perceived as inflexible. The girlfriend's reaction is about the desire for equality, which is a personal value. If the author is unwilling to commit to sharing responsibilities as equally as possible, despite the challenges, that might be where the conflict lies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging his partner's valid perspective and the possibility of shared parenting despite the challenges. His argument, while factually based, might not be respectful of her autonomy and values, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust in the relationship.\n"
