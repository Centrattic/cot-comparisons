I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. Let me break down what the author is saying. They argue that when they have kids, they can't split the parenting duties equally because of biological reasons like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the woman being the primary parent. They also mention economic factors where the man is the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're making a logical argument based on biological and societal factors. They're not saying they won't contribute, just that it's not feasible to split evenly. But maybe that's where the problem is. The girlfriend might see this as a lack of commitment to sharing responsibilities equally, which is a common expectation in modern relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as being realistic about how parenting works. For example, the first few months, the mother does need more time with the baby for bonding and health reasons. Also, societal norms often have men as the primary earners. But the author might be underestimating the possibility of shared parenting beyond the initial period. The girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to split work evenly. That's a big deal for her.\n\nThere's also the assumption in the author's argument that the woman will be the primary parent because of economics. This could be a stereotype. Maybe the author and his girlfriend could have a different arrangement, like shared parental leave or flexible work. But the author is not considering that possibility, or maybe they don't think it's feasible.\n\nAnother angle: the author is making a generalization about all mothers and fathers. Even if there are biological factors, individual experiences vary. The girlfriend might feel that the author is not supporting the idea of equality and is instead setting up a traditional role where the woman is the main caregiver. This could lead to resentment if she feels it's unfair or outdated.\n\nSo the key points are: the author's argument is based on biological and economic factors, but the girlfriend values equality. The author might not be considering that societal roles are changing, and many couples now aim for shared parenting regardless of traditional roles. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her values, which are important for her to have children in a relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not valuing her perspective and for making assumptions about roles that don't align with her expectations. It's possible the author is being logical but not considering the emotional and relational impact of their statements.\n"
