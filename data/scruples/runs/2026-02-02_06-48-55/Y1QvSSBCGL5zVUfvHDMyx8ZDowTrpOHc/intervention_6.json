I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. The author is arguing that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of the biological aspects and the practicalities of childcare. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split in parenting responsibilities, but the author believes that's not feasible, particularly right after birth and due to economic factors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making generalizations about biological differences between mothers and fathers. He mentions maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary parent. He also brings up economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author's argument is based on stereotypes and traditional gender roles. He's assuming that mothers must take on more responsibility because of biology and that men are naturally the breadwinners. But in modern society, these roles are becoming more fluid. Many couples share parenting duties equally, and it's possible for either parent to be the primary caregiver, depending on their circumstances and choices. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing outdated gender norms rather than acknowledging the possibility of shared responsibility through mutual agreement and support.\n\nThe girlfriend is standing her ground on wanting equality, which is a valid perspective. The author's refusal to consider an equal split, especially given the societal shifts towards gender equality, could be seen as dismissive of her needs and the potential for partnership in parenting. By stating it's not possible without acknowledging that it's a choice both can make, he's not leaving room for compromise or adapting to each other's situations. This could indeed be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings and expectations.\n\nMoreover, the author is making assumptions about postpartum bonding being exclusive to mothers. While there's some biological basis for maternal instincts, modern research shows that fathers can also form strong bonds with their children. The idea that the mother must be the primary parent might not account for the flexibility and support systems that couples can develop. So, by asserting that equality isn't possible, the author is not considering the partnership aspect and the effort both can make to share responsibilities.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. The author's approach might come off as rigid and not open to negotiation, which can lead to conflict. The girlfriend's reaction shows that her needs are significant to her, and the author's dismissal of her stance could be the root of the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not valuing her perspective and the possibility of creating an equal partnership through teamwork and support.\n"
