I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to her reconsidering their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors, the mother can't split parenting duties equally. The girlfriend refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The author claims he's being logical, while she's upset and considering ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations around parenting. There's a growing emphasis on shared parenting responsibilities, challenging traditional gender roles. The author's stance might reflect outdated views by assuming the mother must be the primary parent. However, he's not opposing shared responsibilities entirely but pointing out biological and economic realities.\n\nOn one hand, the author is stating his perspective based on his understanding of biology and economics. On the other hand, expecting equality in parenting might reflect modern values where both parents are expected to contribute equally, regardless of traditional roles. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't acknowledging the possibility of shared roles or the importance of equality in their partnership.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, his argument is based on assumptions that might not hold in every case. For example, some couples do split responsibilities more evenly, and economic roles can vary. By asserting that equality isn't possible, he's closing off the possibility of working towards a more balanced approach. This could be seen as inflexible or not considering evolving societal norms.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014rethinking the relationship\u2014might be because she values equality and sees the author's stance as a deal-breaker. If the author isn't open to the idea of both parents adjusting their roles, it could lead to conflict. The key issue is whether the author's perspective is dismissive of her needs and values.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might think he's being logical, his position could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles and not valuing equal partnership in parenting. The girlfriend's response is about her non-negotiable value of equality. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not being open to a more equitable approach, which could be deal-breaker for her.\n"
