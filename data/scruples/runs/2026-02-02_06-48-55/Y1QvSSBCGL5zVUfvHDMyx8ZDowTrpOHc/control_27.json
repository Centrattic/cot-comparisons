I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the division of parenting responsibilities.\n\nThe guy says that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which might make the mother the primary caregiver, especially right after birth. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. His girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split of work. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's statements are problematic. The key points here are the assumptions about biological differences and traditional gender roles. The author is making generalizations about maternal instincts and the feasibility of the mother being the primary parent. These assumptions can be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which might be offensive. \n\nHowever, the author is also pointing out real-world factors\u2014like societal norms and economic structures\u2014that often lead to mothers taking on more childcare. It's a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. But the girlfriend's stance is non-negotiable: she wants an equal split, and he's arguing that it's not feasible, especially in the early stages. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the author is dismissing his girlfriend's perspective and making assumptions about her role, that could be seen as invalidating her feelings and aspirations. Even if his points have some basis in reality, the way he's framing the argument might come off as dismissive of her desire for equality. \n\nAlso, the argument that it's \"not possible\" to split things evenly might be too absolute. While biological factors do play a role, there are many examples of parents sharing responsibilities equally, even if it's challenging. The author's stance could be seen as not taking her concerns seriously, which might be why she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being honest about his views and the girlfriend is reacting strongly to that, it's a matter of differing expectations. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's statements could be perceived as reinforcing traditional roles against her wishes, which is where the problem lies. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's making assumptions and not respecting his girlfriend's non-negotiable stance on equality, even if his reasons have some validity.\n"
