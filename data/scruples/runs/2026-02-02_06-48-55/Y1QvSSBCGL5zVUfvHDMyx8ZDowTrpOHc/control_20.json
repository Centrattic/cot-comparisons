I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in the early stages of a child's life. The main points he makes are about biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the practical aspects like the mother being the primary caregiver and the man being the breadwinner. His girlfriend is upset because she doesn't want to have children with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author is making a case based on biological and practical reasons. He's pointing out that there are inherent differences in the roles because of physical factors like pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum bonding. He's also talking about economic factors where often men are the primary earners. But the girlfriend is standing her ground, saying that she won't have kids with someone who doesn't commit to an equal split.\n\nIs the author wrong to think that these biological factors make an equal split impossible? Well, some people might argue that while there are biological factors, they don't necessarily preclude equality. For example, even though the mother has the initial biological connection, the father can and should take on a significant role. The idea of the mother being the primary caregiver is a societal construct that's changing, so maybe the author is clinging to outdated views. Also, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split evenly might be too absolute. Maybe he's not considering that with effort and flexibility, a more equal split is achievable, even if not 50-50 from day one.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption about economic roles. The author says the man is usually the breadwinner, which isn't always the case anymore. If the girlfriend is the primary earner, that dynamic changes. By making such a generalization, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes, which could be part of the problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about her expectations for equality. If she's clear that equality is non-negotiable for her, then the author's response that it's impossible might be the issue. He's not showing willingness to compromise or find a middle ground. Maybe he's not considering that the concept of equality can be more about equity\u2014each doing their part based on what's feasible, rather than an exact 50-50 split.\n\nAlso, there's the approach of communication. The author might be coming off as dismissive of her feelings, not listening to her perspective. If she's upset because she wants equality, his response that it's not possible might be seen as not valuing her input or their shared goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships require compromise. If the author is unwilling to adjust his stance despite the girlfriend's strong feelings, he might be in the wrong. Even if his points have some merit, the way he's presenting them could be as a refusal to negotiate, which is a relationship deal-breaker for her. The key here is whether the author is being rigid versus open to discussion.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's arguments might have some basis in reality, but his approach is problematic. By stating it's impossible to split work evenly, he's not acknowledging the possibility of adapting and working towards equality, which is what his girlfriend is seeking. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not meeting her needs in the relationship, even if he thinks he's being logical.\n"
