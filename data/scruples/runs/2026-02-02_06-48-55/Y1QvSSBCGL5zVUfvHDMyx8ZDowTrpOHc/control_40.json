I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are different, citing biological and economic factors, and that an equal split isn't possible. The girlfriend, however, won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's points are based on biological differences like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles where men are breadwinners. They believe the mother should be the primary parent initially. The girlfriend's stance is that she expects an equal split, and if the author doesn't agree, she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is wrong for expressing this view. The question isn't just about whether the author is right or wrong in their assessment of parental roles, but whether they are in the wrong in the context of a relationship where this is a dealbreaker for the girlfriend.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's been a shift towards more equality in parenting roles. While biological factors do play a role (like pregnancy and childbirth), many modern couples aim for shared responsibilities. The author's argument might stem from traditional views, but the girlfriend's expectation is about equality, which is a valid and growing perspective.\n\nHowever, the author isn't refusing to be involved; they're arguing that equality isn't feasible. The problem arises if the author is unwilling to consider flexibility or if they are dismissing the girlfriend's needs. If the author is firm in their stance that equality isn't possible and thus the girlfriend's desire is unrealistic, that could be seen as not being in sync with her expectations. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's dealbreaker is a non-negotiable for the other, it's a conflict of values.\n\nBut is the author wrong for having that belief? It's a matter of personal views and how they're communicated. If the author is being honest about their beliefs and the girlfriend is equally honest about her non-negotiable, both are just stating their positions. However, if the author is insisting that their view is the only valid one without room for negotiation, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not realize that while biological factors exist, many couples manage to share parenting more equally with support, flexible work arrangements, etc. The author's economic argument assumes traditional roles, which might not hold true for all, especially as more women are in the workforce and men take on more parenting roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance could be seen as a valid expectation for equality, and if the author is unwilling to commit to that, even if they believe it's impractical, that could be a dealbreaker. The question is whether the author's position is wrong. If they're just stating their beliefs and the girlfriend is doing the same, then neither is inherently wrong, but they may not be compatible. However, if the author is dismissive of her needs or unwilling to find a middle ground, that's where they might be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily wrong for having those beliefs, but if they're unwilling to accommodate their partner's expectations despite knowing it's a dealbreaker, that could make them the asshole. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given that both sides have valid perspectives, the answer might hinge on communication and willingness to compromise rather than the inherent correctness of the views.\n"
