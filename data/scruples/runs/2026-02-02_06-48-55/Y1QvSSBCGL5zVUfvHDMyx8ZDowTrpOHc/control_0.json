I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend are discussing future parenting plans. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of the biological aspects like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic factors where the man is the breadwinner. The author believes that the primary parent role would fall to the mother, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend reacts strongly, saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is pointing out real biological and societal factors. It's true that pregnancy and childbirth are physically experienced by the mother, and postpartum bonding can be stronger initially. Also, societal norms often have men as breadwinners, though this is changing. The author might be trying to set realistic expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is standing by her belief in equality. She might feel that the author is underestimating the potential for shared parenting or is making assumptions based on outdated gender roles. She could perceive the author as not being committed to equality in parenting responsibilities. Her stance might be about wanting an equal partnership regardless of traditional roles.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key here is whether the author's statement is factually accurate or if it's reinforcing harmful stereotypes. While there are biological differences, assuming that the mother must be the primary parent due to these factors might ignore the fact that modern relationships can and do split parenting more equally. The author's argument could be seen as rigid and not accounting for the possibility of shared responsibilities post-childbirth, or the fact that emotional bonding isn't exclusive to mothers. Additionally, economic factors are changing, with more women being breadwinners.\n\nThe author might also be dismissing the emotional labor and other aspects of parenting that aren't strictly biological. The girlfriend's insistence on equal split could stem from a belief in gender equality, which is valid. The author's response could be seen as not respecting her values, leading her to feel undervalued.\n\nSo, the author's logic is based on traditional views that may not align with the girlfriend's expectations of equality. Even if there are biological factors, the author's conclusion that equal split is impossible might be too absolute. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, is about her non-negotiable boundary regarding equality. Therefore, the author's stance might be inconsiderate of her perspective, making them potentially at fault for not finding a middle ground or respecting her viewpoint.\n"
