I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a disagreement with their girlfriend about splitting parenting responsibilities.\n\nThe author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They mention that the mother would need to spend more time with the child immediately after birth and that the mother is more likely to be the primary parent due to economic factors. The girlfriend, however, won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's points. They're making claims about biological differences. But wait, the idea that maternal instincts are innate is actually a stereotype. Modern research suggests that bonding and caregiving abilities aren't exclusive to mothers. Also, postpartum bonding can be a mutual experience; fathers can bond with their babies too. The author's argument assumes that the mother must stay home, which might be based on outdated gender roles where the man is the breadwinner. But many couples these days share responsibilities more equally, and economic factors can vary depending on the couple's situation.\n\nThe author is dismissing the girlfriend's stance, saying she's naive. That's not a good approach. Even if the author believes in traditional roles, the girlfriend is entitled to her perspective. The author could have explained their views without making it a dealbreaker. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values, and the author is not respecting that. If the author is unwilling to compromise or consider her viewpoint, that's where they might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's position seems to assume that equality is impossible, but that's not necessarily true. Many couples manage to share parenting duties equally with some effort and flexibility. The author might be underestimating the potential for shared responsibilities, even if the mother has an initial role. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's argument relies on stereotypes and traditional roles. They didn't engage with their girlfriend's perspective respectfully. By insisting that equality isn't possible, they're not meeting her halfway. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not being open to alternative viewpoints and are making assumptions based on outdated norms.\n"
