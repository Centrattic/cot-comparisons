I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to her reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The author is saying that there's a biological difference in motherhood, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, and that economically, men are more likely to be the breadwinners. So he thinks the mother should be the primary parent, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend disagrees, saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. Now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's stance is based on what he perceives as biological and economic factors. But is that a valid assumption? Modern views on parenting emphasize shared responsibility and challenge traditional gender roles. Assuming that the mother must be the primary parent might come off as reinforcing stereotypes, which could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that equality isn't possible might be overlooking the couple's ability to make choices that go against typical norms. For example, they could both take time off work, share responsibilities, or adjust their careers. The author's statement might be seen as not respecting his partner's autonomy in deciding her role as a parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be realistic about the challenges post-birth and economic factors. But the way he presents it could be perceived as rigid and not open to negotiation. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective, and the author's refusal to consider an equal split might make her feel her needs are not being respected.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author could have approached the discussion differently. Instead of stating that equality isn't possible, maybe he could have discussed potential compromises or how they can work together to achieve balance despite challenges. The fact that she's rethinking the relationship suggests that this was a significant issue for her, possibly because she values equal partnership highly.\n\nSo considering the societal shift towards shared parenting and the potential for the author's comments to reinforce stereotypes, it's possible that the author is in the wrong. His approach might have dismissed her valid perspective and not found a middle ground. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
