I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement regarding the division of parenting responsibilities, specifically motherhood versus fatherhood.\n\nFirst, the author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic reality where men are often the breadwinners. He believes that an equal split in parenting isn't feasible, especially right after birth. The girlfriend, however, is firm in her belief that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. This has led her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's stance is based on biological and economic factors. He's pointing out that there are inherent differences in postpartum care and societal roles. But does that make his position wrong? Well, he's making a factual claim, but maybe the issue is more about how he communicated it or the assumptions he's making.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that equality is non-negotiable. She might feel that the author is not taking shared responsibility seriously or is being dismissive of her desire for equality. There's a possibility that the author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be why she's upset. Even if some of the points are based on current societal norms, the argument could be interpreted as not supporting shared parenting.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not be considering that roles can be more flexible. While there are biological aspects (like pregnancy and childbirth), modern relationships often aim for more equality. The author's assertion that it's not possible to split evenly could be seen as not being open to adapting or challenging traditional roles. That might come across as inflexible or not supportive of his partner's wishes.\n\nAlso, the term \"fundamentally different\" might be problematic. While there are differences, many people believe that both parents can be equally involved if they choose. The author's stance might be seen as dismissing the possibility of shared parenting, which is a valid expectation for many women today.\n\nIn terms of communication, even if the author's points have some validity, the way he presented them could have been hurtful. If he didn't acknowledge her perspective or show willingness to find a middle ground, that could contribute to the conflict. Relationships often require compromise, and if he's not willing to adjust his stance, that might be where he's at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong (A) because his argument could be reinforcing traditional gender roles and not respecting his partner's desire for equality. He might not be open to the idea that both parents can share responsibilities despite some initial challenges. Alternatively, if he's just stating facts and the girlfriend is being unrealistic, then he's not in the wrong (B). But given the current societal emphasis on gender equality and shared parenting, the author's stance might be seen as outdated or not supportive, making him the asshole.\n"
