I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend about splitting parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments both sides are making. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother would naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, making the mother the primary caregiver. He believes a completely equal split isn't feasible. His girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, which has caused her to reconsider their relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statements are inherently wrong. The first thing to note is the assumption that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biology. While it's true that pregnancy and childbirth are biological aspects unique to women, the idea that maternal instincts or postpartum bonding require the mother to be the primary parent is more of a societal assumption rather than a scientific fact. Research shows that bonding can happen with any caregiver, and many fathers are equally capable of providing primary care. Economic factors are also changing, with more women becoming primary earners and men taking on more caregiving roles.\n\nThe author's argument might stem from traditional gender roles, which can perpetuate stereotypes. By asserting that the mother must be the primary parent and that equality isn't possible, he's dismissing the possibility of shared parenting arrangements that adapt to each family's unique situation. The girlfriend's stance is about valuing equality in parenting, which is a valid perspective. Her refusal to compromise on this issue might be based on her personal values, not just being rigid.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not agreeing to an equal split. While it's logical to acknowledge biological differences, framing it as an absolute fact that equality isn't possible might be dismissive of the girlfriend's valid concerns and the evolving norms in parenting roles. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which can be harmful even if the intention isn't malicious.\n\nIn relationships, expectations about parenting should be discussed openly. If the author's stance is non-negotiable, it might clash with the girlfriend's needs for equality, leading to the conflict described. The girlfriend's reaction, although extreme, is a response to feeling unheard or disrespected in her values. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a factual sense, but his approach could be seen as inflexible and not considering the emotional and societal shifts towards more egalitarian parenting.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because his argument is based on outdated or stereotypical views that don't account for the possibility of shared parenting and evolving roles. He's dismissing his partner's valid perspective without room for discussion, which is problematic in a relationship where mutual respect and understanding are key.\n"
