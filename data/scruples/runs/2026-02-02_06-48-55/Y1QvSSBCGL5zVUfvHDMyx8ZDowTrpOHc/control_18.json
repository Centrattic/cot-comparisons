I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a conflict about splitting parenting responsibilities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making a case based on biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner. He's arguing that an equal split isn't feasible. His girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship because he doesn't agree.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's statements are factually accurate or if they're making assumptions that aren't necessarily true. The author mentions biological components, but modern discussions around parenting often emphasize that while there are biological aspects (like the mother needing to recover post-birth), the roles can be shared more equally with proper support and societal changes. Economic factors are changing too; more women are primary breadwinners, and shared parental leave is becoming more common in many places.\n\nThe author's stance could come off as making assumptions about traditional gender roles, which might not align with his girlfriend's expectations for equality. She might feel that he's not open to sharing parenting duties equally, which is a significant deal-breaker for her. Even if there are biological factors, the author's conclusion that an equal split isn't possible might ignore the possibility of cooperation and flexibility in their roles.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument could be seen as diminishing the effort fathers can make, implying that the mother's role is inherently more demanding, which might not be fair. It's important to note that while there are biological differences, societal structures and personal choices also play a huge role in shaping parental roles. The author's refusal to commit to an equal split, regardless of the circumstances, could be viewed as not being in sync with her values, leading her to question their future together.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not acknowledging that shared parenting is achievable with mutual effort, or if he's correct in highlighting certain biological and economic realities. The answer likely hinges on whether one side's perspective is more rigid. The girlfriend's stance is about equality and shared responsibility, which is a common modern viewpoint. The author's arguments, while pointing out existing challenges, might be seen as not being flexible enough to adapt to different parenting models. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering the possibility of shared parenting despite the challenges, which is a deal-breaker for his girlfriend.\n"
