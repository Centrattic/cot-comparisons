I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities. He argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors, like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner. He believes that the mother should be the primary parent, especially after birth, and that a completely equal split isn't possible. His girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, and she's now reconsidering the relationship. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the points he makes. He's bringing up biological differences and societal norms. But gender roles have been evolving, and many people now advocate for more equality in parenting. The idea that the mother must stay home or be the primary parent due to biology is a traditional view that some might see as outdated. There's also the argument about economic factors, but that's more about societal structures rather than something inherent. Plus, many couples now choose different arrangements based on their individual circumstances rather than strict gender roles.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is clear that she wants an equal split. She's not open to the idea that the author is suggesting. His response might be seen as not respecting her stance. Even if he has his reasons, the fact that she's willing to end the relationship over this suggests it's a deal-breaker for her. The author might be dismissing her expectations or not seeing the importance of shared parenting from her perspective. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being realistic versus rigid. He's making generalizations\u2014like maternal instincts are stronger or that the man is the breadwinner. But those aren't universal truths. Many women work and are breadwinners, and many fathers are primary caregivers. By stating that it's not possible to split equally, he might be ignoring the flexibility and choices couples can make. \n\nAlso, the way he frames it as \"fundamentally different\" could be seen as essentializing gender roles, which some might find problematic. It's important to acknowledge individual choices and partnerships that don't conform to traditional roles. The girlfriend's stance is about equality, and the author's refusal to consider an equal split might be perceived as not supporting her desire for equity, regardless of biological factors. \n\nI should also consider the context of the question. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer could depend on perspectives. Some might see the author as being realistic about current societal structures, while others might see him as enforcing stereotypes. Relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If the author isn't willing to meet her halfway or consider alternative arrangements, that could be an issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument seems to rely on assumptions that may not hold up in modern contexts and doesn't fully respect his partner's values. His refusal to agree to an equal split despite her stance could be seen as inflexible, hence making him the asshole in this situation.\n"
