I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about the equality of parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the argument. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners and women the primary caregivers. His conclusion is that a 50/50 split isn't feasible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The author's stance is based on biological and societal factors. But there's a risk here of making assumptions about gender roles and capabilities. The girlfriend is pushing back against the idea that women must be the primary caregivers, advocating for equality. \n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) Are the author's claims about biology and societal norms valid or outdated? 2) Is it wrong to make assumptions about how parenting will work based on gender? 3) Does the author's position undermine the possibility of shared parenting?\n\nModern research shows that while there are biological differences, many of the traditional roles are shaped by societal expectations and can be changed with effort and awareness. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing stereotypes that women are naturally more suited for childcare, which can limit the potential for equal sharing. Additionally, economic factors are changing, with more women in the workforce and men taking on more parenting roles. \n\nBy stating that a 50/50 split isn't possible, the author might be closing off the conversation without considering the couple's ability to work together to overcome challenges. The girlfriend's reaction is about wanting equality, which is a valid stance in many relationships. The author's position could be seen as not respecting her desire for equality, thus being dismissive of her perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's argument relies on traditional views that may not align with modern, egalitarian values. By asserting that equality isn't possible, he's not engaging with the possibility of working towards a more balanced approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for reinforcing stereotypes and not being open to the idea that couples can create shared parenting arrangements despite societal norms.\n"
