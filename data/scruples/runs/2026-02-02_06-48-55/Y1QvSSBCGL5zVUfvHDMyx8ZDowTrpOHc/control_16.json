I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding fatherhood and motherhood. The author argues that they can't split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors and economic reasons. The girlfriend is upset and considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is being logical or if they're making a mistake. The author's points are about biological differences and traditional roles. But modern relationships often emphasize equality and challenging traditional gender roles. By saying that the mother should be the primary parent, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes that can limit both parents' roles. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. That shows her commitment to shared responsibility. The author's argument could be seen as dismissing her wishes and not being open to alternative arrangements. Even if there are biological factors, they can't be the only consideration. Partners can plan for challenges, like sharing childcare duties and supporting each other's roles. The author's refusal to consider equality might be seen as inflexible and not respecting the girlfriend's desires.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split work evenly could be viewed as a fixed mindset. It's important for couples to work together and find solutions rather than assuming limitations. The author's approach might not account for their partnership's evolving dynamics. The girlfriend might feel unheard or that her perspective isn't valued. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong by not being open to the idea of equality and not respecting the girlfriend's needs. Relationships require compromise, and the author's stance could be seen as rigid, leading to the conflict.\n"
