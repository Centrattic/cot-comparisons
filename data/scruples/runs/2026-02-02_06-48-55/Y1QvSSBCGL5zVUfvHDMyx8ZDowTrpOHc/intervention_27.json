I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their views on fatherhood and motherhood. The author argues that it's impossible to split parenting responsibilities equally due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. They mention biological and economic factors. Are these points accurate or are they reinforcing stereotypes? Biological factors: maternal instincts and postpartum bonding are indeed real phenomena, supported by some research. However, the assumption that only mothers have these instincts might be an oversimplification. Also, modern discussions about parenting often emphasize that both parents can bond with the child and share responsibilities, even if the mother has a biological advantage initially.\n\nEconomic factors: The idea that men are typically the breadwinners is a societal norm that's been challenged in recent years. Many women are now primary earners, and dual-income households are common. The author's assumption might be based on outdated gender roles. Plus, suggesting that the mother must be the primary parent due to economics could be dismissive of the possibility of shared financial responsibilities or other arrangements.\n\nThe author's main argument is that equality isn't feasible, which might be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality. The girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, which shows her values. The author's response could be perceived as not valuing her perspective or not being open to alternative views on parenting. \n\nIs the author being logical or is their logic flawed? They present their points based on traditional roles, but maybe not considering that societal changes allow for more flexibility. The girlfriend's reaction is about respecting her autonomy and values. If the author is unwilling to consider non-traditional approaches, that might be the issue.\n\nAlso, the way the author frames their argument could come off as dismissive. Saying there's \"no way\" to split things evenly might not account for the couples' capacity to negotiate and adapt. It's possible that the author isn't open to the idea that both partners can share responsibilities beyond traditional roles, which could be why the girlfriend feels unheard.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the context of their relationship and previous discussions. If the author hasn't been open to discussing shared parenting models or has made assumptions based on gender roles without considering her perspective, then they might be in the wrong. The key is mutual respect and willingness to compromise. If the author is rigid in their stance without considering her needs, that's problematic. However, if they're just stating their views without being derogatory, it's more about differing values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their argument reinforces traditional gender roles and dismisses the possibility of equal sharing, which the girlfriend values. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
