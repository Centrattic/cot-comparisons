I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation revolves around a disagreement about the division of parental responsibilities, particularly after the birth of a child.\n\nFirst, the author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset because she expects an equal split in parenting responsibilities but the author is saying it's not possible.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are assumptions about gender roles and the possibility of equality. The author is making generalizations about biological differences and traditional economic roles. But modern perspectives often emphasize that while there are biological aspects to motherhood, such as breastfeeding, the roles of parents can be more flexible. The author might be underestimating the possibility of shared responsibilities or the couple's ability to adapt. Also, assuming that the woman will be the primary parent due to these factors could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which might not align with the girlfriend's expectations of equality.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting an equal partnership, which is a valid perspective. The author's argument that it's impossible might be dismissive of her desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, the author isn't considering that both parents can share responsibilities in other ways, and that societal norms are changing. The author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that their partnership can find a way to share the load more equally despite initial challenges. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his viewpoint reinforces traditional gender roles and doesn't fully address the possibility of a more equitable partnership.\n"
