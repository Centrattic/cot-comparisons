I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question, \"AITA\") is in the wrong for stating that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the argument. The author is making a point about biological and societal factors influencing the division of parenting responsibilities. They mention maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is making a valid argument or if they're making harmful assumptions. The author is pointing out real biological differences, like the mother's physical involvement in pregnancy and childbirth, which can affect bonding and initial care. However, they also bring up economic factors that are more societal than biological. This could imply that the author is reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be problematic in a modern relationship where both partners might expect more equality.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. That's her boundary, and the author's argument is causing her to reconsider the relationship. The author might be seen as being unrealistic if they're assuming that societal norms will dictate their personal situation. For example, even if there are traditional roles, they might not apply to this couple if they choose to have different arrangements. The author might also be underestimating the possibility of changing societal norms and the couple's ability to negotiate their own roles.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption about economic roles. The author says the man is usually the breadwinner, which is a generalization. Many women are now breadwinners or both parents share income, so this might not be a given. By stating this as a fact, the author could be dismissing potential for flexibility in their partnership.\n\nThe author's statement that an equal split isn't possible could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, it's possible to work towards a more balanced approach over time, even if not immediately after birth. The author might be framing the situation as a fixed outcome rather than a flexible scenario where they can adapt and find a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their argument is based on valid points or harmful stereotypes. Acknowledging biological differences is one thing, but using that to justify unequal responsibilities without considering the couple's specific circumstances or the possibility of changing roles could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author isn't committed to equality in the partnership, which is a valid concern in a modern relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's argument might be reinforcing traditional gender roles and not accounting for the couple's potential to challenge those norms. The girlfriend's boundary is about equality, and the author's stance is conflicting with that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible and for making assumptions based on outdated or generalized societal norms.\n"
