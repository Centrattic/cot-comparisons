I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author told their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. They argue that it's not possible to split parenting responsibilities evenly, especially right after birth, due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic reasons where the man is typically the breadwinner and the woman the primary caregiver. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split, while the author thinks she's being naive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's statements are factually correct or if they're making harmful assumptions. The author is pointing out biological differences, which is a real aspect of motherhood. However, they're implying that these differences necessitate the mother being the primary parent and that equality isn't feasible. \n\nModern discussions around parenting often emphasize that while there are biological factors (like pregnancy and postpartum), societal and economic structures have changed, and many couples do share parenting duties equally. The author's comment might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which can be problematic. By stating that it's often more feasible for the mother to stay home, the author might be suggesting that it's the woman's responsibility, which could be offensive to the girlfriend who wants equality.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of stating their position as a fact without considering the girlfriend's perspective or values is probably what escalated the issue. The girlfriend might see this as dismissive or not respecting her autonomy. Even if the author feels they're being logical, it's important in relationships to acknowledge each other's viewpoints and work towards mutual understanding. The argument could have been approached more collaboratively, exploring how they can share responsibilities based on their circumstances, rather than asserting that equality isn't possible.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the author is making assumptions based on traditional roles, 2) they're not acknowledging that couples can and do share parenting differently, 3) they're not being open to the girlfriend's desire for equality, which is a valid expectation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're imposing their views without considering shared responsibility or the possibility of challenging traditional norms. Their communication style, which seems to dismiss the girlfriend's stance, is likely part of the problem.\n"
