I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments both sides presented. The author states that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother will be the primary parent, especially right after birth. They also mention economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe question is whether the author's stance is wrong. From a societal perspective, there's a lot of emphasis on equality in parenting. The idea that mothers naturally take on more responsibility due to biology has been challenged many times. Studies show that while there are biological aspects like pregnancy and breastfeeding, cultural and societal norms also play a huge role in shaping parental roles. The author's argument seems to rely on traditional gender roles, which some might see as outdated or restrictive.\n\nHowever, the author is also pointing out practical realities: postpartum bonding and the physical reality of childbirth. These are facts, but the assumption that these necessitate the mother being the primary parent is debatable. Many modern couples do share parenting duties more equally, and societal support structures are evolving to allow for that. The author might be overgeneralizing by saying it's impossible to split responsibilities equally, not accounting for flexibility and mutual effort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about respecting her choice to have an equal partnership. If she's not willing to compromise on this, the author's insistence on the traditional model could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The core issue here is about differing expectations. The author is stating a perspective based on perceived realities, but the girlfriend sees equality as non-negotiable.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the viewpoint. If the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's stance is invalid. While there's truth to some biological factors, the author's conclusion that an equal split is impossible might ignore the potential for shared parenting and the role of societal change. By not being open to the possibility that they can work towards equality despite challenges, the author could be seen as not fully respecting their partner's values and needs. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not acknowledging the partner's perspective on equality and may be reinforcing traditional roles that the partner rejects.\n"
