I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially right after birth, and that the split of responsibilities can't be completely even. She's now considering breaking up with him because she wants an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is making a point about biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which are real. There's also the economic aspect where men are often the primary breadwinners. These are points that some people might agree with, but they can also be controversial. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split. That shows she values equality in parenting. The author says it's not possible, but maybe she's pushing back against traditional roles. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, assuming that one parent (usually the mother) should take on more responsibility because of biology or economics might be seen as reinforcing stereotypes. Even if there are biological factors, it's important to consider that societal expectations and policies can change. Also, the idea that the man must be the breadwinner is becoming less common as more women work and men take on more domestic roles. \n\nBy stating that an equal split isn't possible, the author might be dismissing his partner's desire for equality. Even if there are challenges, the willingness to work towards a fair and equal partnership is important in a relationship. The author's perspective might come off as inflexible or not considering the importance of shared responsibilities in modern relationships. \n\nSo, while the author might have valid points about current realities, his approach might be contributing to the conflict. The girlfriend's reaction is about wanting a partner who is committed to equality, which is a valid stance. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not fully supporting his partner's values, even if his reasoning has some basis in reality.\n"
