She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family. The situation is complicated because of their history. The sister was the favorite, leading the author to feel like an outcast. He's been trying to get back at her for years, and this Christmas prank was meant to get attention. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside, which led to her crying and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, the prank itself. Giving a fake gift that looked real but wasn't, especially when there's a history of tension, could be seen as crossing a line. Even though the author might have intended it as a joke, the sister ended up feeling hurt. The fact that she was excited and then disappointed, leading to her emotional reaction, is a problem. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which the author dismisses as his sister being spoiled. But the family's role is to mediate and protect family members from harmful behavior, so their response might be valid.\n\nThe author's motivation is also key. He mentions using pranks to get attention and revenge due to past feelings of neglect. This suggests that the prank was more about his own unresolved issues than a harmless joke. The prank happened in front of the entire family, which added public humiliation, making it more hurtful.\n\nConsidering the sister's reaction and the family's response, it seems like the author's actions caused real emotional harm. Pranks are usually meant to be lighthearted, but this one had a negative impact. The author's history with his sister likely made the prank more damaging. So, the answer is probably A\u2014he's in the wrong because the prank was harmful and based on negative motivations.\n"
