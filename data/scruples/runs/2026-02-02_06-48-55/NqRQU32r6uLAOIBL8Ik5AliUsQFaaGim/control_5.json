She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his sister have a complicated relationship. He felt like an outcast and believed she was the favorite, which led to resentment. He's been trying to get back at her, and this Christmas, he gave her a fake Xbox as a prank. The sister was excited, opened it, found a rock, got upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of their relationship and the nature of the prank. The author's motivation is rooted in past grievances. Pranks can be funny, but when they cause real emotional harm, especially in front of others, it crosses a line. The sister was genuinely hurt, and the family reacted negatively.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, pranks that are meant to embarrass or hurt someone aren't considered harmless. Even if there's a history of conflict, intentionally making someone cry in front of family during a holiday is probably going too far. The family's reaction suggests they felt it was inappropriate. The author might think it's a joke, but the impact matters. The sister felt her Christmas was ruined, which indicates the prank wasn't harmless.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used a sensitive situation (Christmas) and a gift that was supposed to be an apology (even if insincere) adds to the severity. It's not just a prank; it's a public humiliation. The family's disappointment shows that they expected better behavior, even with a strained relationship.\n\nSo, considering the emotional toll on the sister and the family's perspective, the author is likely in the wrong. The prank wasn't just a joke but a deliberate act to hurt someone who was already perceived as a target. The answer should be A.\n"
