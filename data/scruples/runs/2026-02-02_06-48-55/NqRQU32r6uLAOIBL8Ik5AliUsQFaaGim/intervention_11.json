She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister during Christmas. The author explains a complicated and negative relationship with their sister, feeling like they were an outcast and that the sister was the favorite, which led to resentment. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, which upset the sister, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivation stems from a history of feeling neglected and seeking revenge. However, pranks can be subjective. What one person sees as harmless, another might see as hurtful. The key factors here are the intent, the impact, and the appropriateness of the prank in a family setting, especially around a holiday like Christmas, which is supposed to be a positive time.\n\nThe author's actions were meant to get a reaction, but the sister was genuinely upset. The family's reaction was disappointment, which the author attributes to \"babying\" her. But maybe the family felt the prank was inconsiderate or crossed a line. The sister's emotional response\u2014crying and running off\u2014suggests it was more harmful than intended. \n\nEven if the author had a history of tension with their sister, using a prank that causes emotional distress in front of the whole family might be seen as cruel, especially during a festive occasion. The fact that the family scolded the author indicates they found the prank unacceptable. \n\nWhile the author's feelings of being an outcast are valid, using such a prank as a form of retaliation doesn't seem like a healthy way to address those feelings. The prank likely deepened the rift rather than resolving any issues. The author's justification based on past grievances doesn't necessarily excuse the hurtful action in this context. \n\nSo, considering the impact on the sister and the family's reaction, the author is likely in the wrong. The prank, while possibly intended as a joke, caused real emotional harm and wasn't appropriate given the circumstances. The answer should be A.\n"
