She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation is a bit complex because the author has a complicated history with their sister, feeling overlooked and resentful. They pranked her by giving her a fake Xbox with a rock, leading to her crying and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions feeling like an outcast and having a strained relationship with their sister. However, the prank itself involved publicly humiliating her during a family gathering, which can be seen as crossing a line. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional distress or hurt, especially in a sensitive setting like a family event, they may not be appropriate.\n\nThe sister's reaction was immediate emotional pain, which indicates the prank had a negative impact. The family's disapproval also suggests that the prank was not well-received. Even if the author intended it as a joke, the execution might have been too harsh, especially given the existing tension. Public pranks that embarrass someone can exacerbate family conflicts and hurt feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author wanted revenge for feeling overlooked, but using a prank that causes public humiliation might not be the healthiest way to address those feelings. It's possible the author's actions were driven by unresolved issues, but that doesn't justify hurting someone else. The key here is whether the prank was reasonable and respectful given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of social norms, pranks are usually about fun and light-heartedness. If a prank leads to someone feeling humiliated or the family being upset, it's often seen as going too far. The author's justification of a complicated relationship might not absolve them of responsibility for the hurt caused. The sister's emotional reaction and the family's disappointment point towards the prank being inappropriate.\n\nSo, while the author might feel they have reasons for the prank, the impact on others and the context of the family event likely make it a harmful action. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
