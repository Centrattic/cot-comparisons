She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt like an outcast and wanted to get back at their sister, who they believe was the favorite and ruined their childhood.\n\nThe prank was giving a fake Xbox One with a rock inside, pretending it was an apology gift. The sister was excited, opened it, found the prank, and got upset. The family reacted negatively. The author is confused if they're the asshole or if the family is just overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the prank was in bad taste. Pranks can be funny if they don't cause real harm, but this one led to emotional distress. The sister cried and said it ruined her Christmas. The author's intent might have been to get back at her, given their history. However, doing it in front of the family adds public humiliation, which is harsh.\n\nSibling rivalry is normal, but when it crosses into causing emotional harm, especially with a history of hurt, it becomes problematic. The author's actions might have been a way to seek attention or retaliate, but the method was hurtful. The family's reaction suggests they see it as crossing a line, so their disapproval is a sign that the prank wasn't harmless.\n\nAlso, the context of Christmas, a time when people expect joy, makes the prank more impactful negatively. The sister's emotional response is valid, so the author's action likely was in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
