She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation is that the sister was their parent's favorite, and the author felt like an outcast. They took the sister's favorite toy (Xbox) and replaced it with a rock.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The history between them is complicated, with the sister being spoiled and the author feeling neglected. Now, the prank involved a fake Xbox with a rock. The sister got upset, cried, and the family was disappointed. The author is questioning if it's a harmless prank or if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, factors to consider: the intent behind the prank. The author admitted they wanted to get back at the sister for ruining their childhood, implying revenge. Pranks are supposed to be light-hearted, but this one caused emotional distress. The sister was excited, opened the gift in front of everyone, then found out it was a fake. The family scolded them, showing they found it inappropriate.\n\nThe prank might be seen as mean-spirited, especially given the history. Even if the author felt mistreated, using a prank that humiliates the sister in front of the family could be crossing a line. The sister's reaction was strong, indicating it wasn't just a simple joke. The family's reaction also suggests they didn't approve. \n\nBut the author argues that the family is babying the sister. Maybe the sister is more sensitive, but the prank still caused harm. The question is whether intent matters. If the prank was meant to hurt or get back at the sister, then it's not harmless. Even if the sister was spoiled, the action still caused emotional damage. \n\nIn conclusion, the prank likely went too far. The author's history of resentment and the outcome (sister crying, family disappointed) indicate that they were in the wrong. The prank wasn't harmless and crossed into bullying or mean behavior, even if it was a joke. So the answer is A.\n"
