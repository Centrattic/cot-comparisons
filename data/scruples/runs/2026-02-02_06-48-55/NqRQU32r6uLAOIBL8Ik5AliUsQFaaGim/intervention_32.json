She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister. The key points here are the context of their relationship and the nature of the prank.\n\nFirst, the author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast, which led them to pick on her. The sister was the family's favorite, and the author feels she ruined their childhood. This background suggests a history of negative interactions and possible emotional baggage. \n\nThe prank involved giving a fake Xbox One as a Christmas gift. The author set this up in front of the entire family, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and the family's disapproval. The author is questioning whether the prank was harmless or if they were in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the prank itself: using a fake Xbox with a rock inside. This isn't just a simple joke; it's a setup that leads to a public humiliation of the sister. The sister was genuinely excited, and the prank caused her to cry and run away. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which the author interprets as the family babying the sister. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and impact. The author's intent might have been to get back at the sister for past grievances, but the impact on the sister was significant emotional distress. Even if the author sees it as a prank, causing someone to cry and feel betrayed, especially in a family setting, is problematic. \n\nMoreover, the public nature of the prank in front of the entire family adds to the humiliation. Family gatherings are supposed to be positive events, and ruining someone's Christmas experience by pranking them like this could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that the author used a fake gift meant to look like a generous gesture (\"apology item\") and then revealed it as a joke with a rock is particularly hurtful. \n\nThe author's history of feeling mistreated and their desire for attention might explain their actions, but it doesn't justify them. Pranks are often about humor and light-hearted fun, but this seems more like intentional harm, possibly rooted in unresolved family issues. The family's reaction is likely based on the negative impact on the sister and the inappropriate timing and setting of the prank.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have their own issues contributing to the prank, the action caused significant emotional distress and was done in a context where it was expected to be a positive moment. The prank's impact overshadows any potential humor, making the author responsible for the harm caused. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
