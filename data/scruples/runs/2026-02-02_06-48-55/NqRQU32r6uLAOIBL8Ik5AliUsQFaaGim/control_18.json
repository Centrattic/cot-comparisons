She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast, and past issues where the sister was the family's favorite. The prank was meant to get back at her, and they did it in front of the family during a sensitive time like Christmas.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. Pranks can be okay if they're light-hearted and both parties enjoy them. But this seems more like revenge than a harmless joke. The author admits to a history of picking on the sister to be noticed, which adds to the negative intent. Also, doing this during a family gathering where emotions might be high (Christmas) could make the prank more hurtful. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying and saying they ruined her Christmas. The family's response was disappointment and scolding, which suggests they felt it was inappropriate.\n\nEven if the author thinks it's a harmless prank, the sister's emotional response and the family's reaction indicate it crossed a line. Using a fake gift as an apology item might also be seen as mocking her, especially given their history. The prank likely made her feel further victimized. So, while the author might not have intended malicious harm, the combination of past issues, the setting, and the sister's reaction makes this prank problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
