She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by pranking his sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt like an outcast because his sister was the favorite. He pranks her with a fake Xbox, leading to her emotional reaction and the family scolding him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements. The prank was during a family event\u2014Christmas\u2014which is supposed to be a time for joy and togetherness. The author's motivation seems rooted in past grievances, possibly a desire for revenge or attention. The prank itself involved deception, replacing a real gift with a fake, which could be seen as cruel, especially given the context of Christmas. The sister's reaction\u2014crying, hating him, saying Christmas was ruined\u2014indicates it hurt her deeply. The family's disapproval suggests that they found the prank inappropriate, even if they've had a complicated relationship.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, he might feel justified because of his history with his sister. However, the prank was public and during a significant family event. Public humiliation or pranks that cause emotional distress are generally frowned upon, especially when there's a history of tension. The sister's emotional response and the family's disappointment indicate that the prank crossed a line.\n\nThe question is whether the prank was harmless. The author might argue it was a joke, but the impact on the sister and the family's reaction suggest it wasn't harmless. The act of replacing a gift with something that causes emotional pain, especially after a history of feeling neglected, shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if there was a past of mutual dislike, using a family event to execute a prank that leads to such a reaction is problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that the family is just \"babying her\" might be a defense mechanism. The family's role is to maintain harmony, and their scolding indicates they see the prank as harmful. The author's actions disrupted that harmony, which could lead to long-term resentment. The prank wasn't just a minor joke; it had real emotional consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a complex background, the prank itself was inappropriate given the context and the emotional impact. The author is in the wrong because he used a family event to humiliate his sister in a way that caused significant distress, and didn't consider the broader consequences on family dynamics.\n"
