She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister during Christmas. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic where the author feels like they were an outcast, and the sister was the favorite. The author's prank was replacing an Xbox gift with a rock, leading to emotional fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension and past issues, which might influence their actions. However, pranks, even if rooted in personal history, need to be evaluated based on their impact. The prank caused the sister to cry and ruined her Christmas. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, not laughter. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and the appropriateness of the prank. The author intended to get back at the sister, which might be seen as revenge rather than a harmless joke. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which increases the public humiliation aspect. The sister's emotional response and the family's disapproval suggest that the prank crossed a line, especially during a sensitive time like Christmas.\n\nEven if there's a history of conflict, the prank's timing, the emotional impact, and the public nature make it problematic. The author might not have considered how the sister would feel, especially if she was genuinely excited about the gift. The family's reaction indicates that they found the prank hurtful, not funny. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because the prank was cruel and inconsiderate, despite their personal grievances.\n"
