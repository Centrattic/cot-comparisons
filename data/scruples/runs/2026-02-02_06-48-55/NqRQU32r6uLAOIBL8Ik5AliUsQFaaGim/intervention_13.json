She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author explains their complicated relationship, feeling like an outcast, and that their sister was the favorite, leading to resentment. They pranked her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock, which upset her and the family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author has a history of a complicated relationship with their sister, but that doesn't excuse harmful behavior. Pranks can be okay if they're light-hearted and don't cause real harm. However, in this case, the prank led to the sister crying, feeling ruined Christmas, and the family being disappointed. The author expected humor but instead caused emotional distress.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and consequence. The author might have intended it as a joke, but considering the sister's emotional reaction and the family's response, it's clear the prank crossed a line. The sister was already vulnerable, and the prank might have triggered deeper feelings of resentment or hurt. Also, doing it in front of the family added public humiliation, which is more severe.\n\nEven if there's a history of tension, pranks should not be used to vent old grievances. Healthy conflict resolution is better. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank wasn't seen as harmless. So, the author likely is in the wrong here because the prank caused significant emotional harm and wasn't appropriate given the family setting and the sister's feelings.\n"
