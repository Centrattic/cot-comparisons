She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt overlooked and resents their sister for being the favorite. The prank was giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and family disapproval.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's motivation stems from long-standing feelings of being an outcast and resentment towards their sister. The prank was done publicly during a family event, which might have added pressure. The sister was clearly hurt and upset, reacting strongly. The family was disappointed and scolded the author. \n\nNow, considering the prank itself. Giving a fake gift that makes the recipient feel embarrassed or humiliated, especially in front of others, can be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author intended it as a joke, the sister's reaction shows it caused real emotional pain. The family's response indicates they found it inappropriate, which is significant because family dynamics matter here. \n\nThe author's justification is that they wanted to get back at their sister for past grievances. However, using a public family event to enact revenge might not be the healthiest approach. Pranks should ideally not cause harm or distress, and especially not in a context where the recipient might feel publicly embarrassed. The sister's reaction\u2014crying, saying she hates the author, and ruining Christmas\u2014suggests significant emotional impact. \n\nEven if the author views the prank as harmless, the consequences were negative. The sister's emotional response and the family's disapproval point towards the prank being inappropriate. The fact that the author has a history of resentment and the prank was a form of payback complicates things further. While sibling rivalry can be playful, this seems more malicious than a light-hearted joke. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The prank likely caused unnecessary harm, was done in a sensitive setting, and the author's underlying motivations may have influenced an overreaction. The family's scolding suggests they see it as wrong, and the sister's distress is a clear indicator. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
