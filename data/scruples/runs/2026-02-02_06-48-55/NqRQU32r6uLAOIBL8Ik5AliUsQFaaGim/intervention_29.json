She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style story is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author's sister was supposedly the favorite, leading to the author feeling neglected and lashing out. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, which upset the sister and caused the family to react negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like they were overshadowed and neglected. The prank was done in front of the entire family, and instead of the expected Xbox, there was just a rock. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed in the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so they might be looking for confirmation or a deeper analysis.\n\nI should consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension and feeling like they needed to get attention by pranking their sister. The prank here escalated things, as it was done in front of the whole family. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, saying she hates the author, and running off. The family's response was disappointment and scolding.\n\nPranks can be harmless, but they depend on the context and the people involved. If the sister didn't find it funny and it caused emotional harm, then the prank might have crossed a line. The author's motivation is important too. They admitted to wanting to get back at their sister, which suggests it wasn't just a light-hearted joke. The public nature of the prank adds to the humiliation for the sister, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the author's history of picking on their sister and feeling resentful might mean that the prank is part of a pattern of behavior rather than an isolated incident. The family's reaction might be because they see it as hurtful, especially during a sensitive time like Christmas. The fact that the author expected the family to laugh but they didn't indicates a disconnect between the author's perception and the family's values.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that pranks are part of sibling dynamics, and maybe the sister was overly sensitive. But given the emotional impact described, it's hard to see it as harmless. The author's own admission of a complicated and hostile relationship suggests that this prank could have been particularly damaging.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because the prank caused significant emotional distress, was done in a public setting, and stems from unresolved family issues rather than a simple joke. The family's reaction is a sign that they view the prank as harmful, even if the author sees it differently.\n"
