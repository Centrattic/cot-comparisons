She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship with a history of tension. The author felt like an outcast and blamed their sister for ruining their childhood. The prank was giving a fake Xbox (a rock in a case) as a Christmas gift, leading to the sister being upset and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of antagonizing their sister, using pranks as a way to get attention they felt they lacked. The prank itself, while perhaps intended as a joke, might be seen as cruel given the existing strained relationship. The sister's reaction was strong, and the family was upset, not laughing as the author expected. \n\nThe key points here are intent and the impact. The author's intent was to get back at their sister, not just a harmless prank. The method involved deception and caused emotional distress. Even if the author sees it as a joke, the sister and family view it as hurtful. The family's reaction (scolding and disappointment) indicates that the prank crossed a line, especially in a setting meant for celebration like Christmas.\n\nAdditionally, the author's history of feeling like an outcast and using pranks to seek attention might be a red flag. It suggests a pattern of behavior that could be harmful rather than playful. The sister's response of crying and saying \"I hate you\" shows significant emotional impact. The family's disapproval isn't just \"babying\" the sister; it's a sign that the prank was inappropriate in the context and timing.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious in the sense of wanting to hurt, were mean-spirited given the relationship history and the setting. The prank was not harmless and caused real emotional harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
