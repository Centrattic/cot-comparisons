She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt neglected and used pranks as a way to get attention. The prank was giving an empty Xbox box with a rock, making the sister cry, and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of feeling like an outcast and a complicated relationship with their sister. However, the prank itself involved deception and emotional harm. The sister was excited and then upset, leading to her reacting strongly. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which the author interprets as babying her.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intent might have been to get back at their sister and gain attention, but the impact was causing emotional distress. Pranks can be okay if they're light-hearted and mutual, but this seems more malicious. The author's sister felt betrayed and hurt, which indicates the prank went too far. The family's reaction suggests they saw it as crossing a line, which is significant.\n\nAlso, the author's justification based on past grievances doesn't excuse the prank. While there's a history, it's important to consider the current consequences. The prank wasn't harmless; it led to crying and ruined the sister's Christmas. Even if the author felt justified, the action was hurtful. The family's disappointment shows a breach of trust, which is a big deal.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the prank caused emotional harm and wasn't appropriate for a family gathering. The sister's reaction indicates it was too much, and the family's response aligns with that. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
