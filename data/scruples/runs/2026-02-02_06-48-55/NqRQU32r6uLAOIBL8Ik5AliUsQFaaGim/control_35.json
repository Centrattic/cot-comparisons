She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family. The story says he gave her a fake Xbox as a prank, which made her cry and caused family members to be disappointed.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author mentions a complicated relationship with his sister, feeling like he was an outcast and she was the favorite. He's been trying to get back at her for a long time. The prank was during Christmas, a time when family interactions are expected to be positive, like the sister said. The prank involved making her believe she received a genuine gift, then revealing it was a fake with a rock. That's a bit harsh, especially in front of the family.\n\nThe sister's reaction was emotional\u2014she cried and said he ruined her Christmas. The family was disappointed, not amused. Pranks should generally be light-hearted and not cause hurt feelings. Even if the author and sister don't get along, the prank crossed a line by using a fake gift during a family event. It's not harmless if it causes emotional harm. The family's disapproval suggests they felt it was inappropriate. So, the author likely is in the wrong.\n"
