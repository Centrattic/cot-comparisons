She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt like an outcast and their sister was the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox, which led to the sister crying and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension and that the prank was part of a pattern of retaliation. But pranks can cross a line when they cause emotional harm. The sister was excited, opened the gift in front of everyone, and then was upset. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which suggests they saw it as harmful.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author might have intended it as a joke, but the sister's reaction was severe. Even if the author and sister don't get along, pranking in front of family can be seen as public shaming, especially if the sister was vulnerable (expecting an apology gift). The family's disapproval indicates they felt the prank was hurtful. The author's justification of past issues doesn't excuse the current action. The prank caused distress, so the author is likely at fault here.\n"
