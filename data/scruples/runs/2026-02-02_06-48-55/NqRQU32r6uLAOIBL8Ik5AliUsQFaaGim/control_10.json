She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author explains their complicated relationship with their sister. They felt neglected and their sister was the favorite. The prank was giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to their sister being upset. The family reacted negatively, scolding the author.\n\nNow, the key points here. The prank was done in front of the entire family. The sister was excited, opened the gift expecting something real, and then got hurt. The author's motivation includes past resentment and trying to get attention. \n\nPranks can be funny, but they can cross the line. The prank here caused emotional distress. The sister's reaction was negative, crying and saying the Christmas was ruined. Family members were disappointed. Even if the author has a history of being mistreated, using a public prank that humiliates or hurts another person's feelings can be considered wrong. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The prank may not have been intended to be malicious, but the harm caused is real. The sister's emotional reaction and the family's disapproval suggest that the prank went too far. \n\nAlso, the author's history with their sister might explain the motivation, but it doesn't necessarily justify the prank. The context of a family gathering where such a prank could damage relationships and create long-term hurt is important. \n\nSo, considering the impact on the sister and the family's reaction, the author's prank was harmful and inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
