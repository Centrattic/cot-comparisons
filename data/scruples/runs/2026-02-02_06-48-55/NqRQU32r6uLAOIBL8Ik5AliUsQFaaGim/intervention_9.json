She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister during Christmas. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like they were the outcast and the sister was the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox One (a box with a rock) as a Christmas gift, leading to the sister being upset and the family scolding the author.\n\nI need to consider the severity of the prank. Christmas is a significant family event, and pranks that cause emotional distress can be problematic. The author's sister was genuinely excited, and the prank led to her crying and feeling ruined. The family's reaction was disappointment, which the author attributes to the sister being babied. However, the sister's emotional response is a key point here. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation: using the prank as a form of revenge for feeling neglected. This adds a layer of personal conflict and possible unresolved issues. The prank wasn't just a joke but tied into deeper family dynamics. \n\nWas the prank harmless? The sister was excited, the prank made her upset, and the family didn't find it funny. The author's justification might be about their own feelings, but the impact on the sister and family is negative. The prank went too far, especially in a sensitive setting like a family holiday. \n\nConsidering these factors, the prank likely crossed the line from harmless fun to something hurtful. The author's actions caused emotional harm, so they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
