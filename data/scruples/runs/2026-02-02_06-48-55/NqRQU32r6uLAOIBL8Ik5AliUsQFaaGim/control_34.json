She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family. The story is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and his sister have a complicated relationship. The sister was the favorite, leading the author to feel like an outcast. He mentions a history of conflict where the sister \"ruined his life and stole his childhood,\" and he's been seeking revenge. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to her emotional reaction and family disapproval.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intent behind the prank, the context of their relationship, and the consequences. The author's motivation isn't just a simple joke; it's rooted in years of resentment and a desire for revenge. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which adds public humiliation. The sister had an emotional reaction, crying and running off, which the author might have anticipated or not. The family scolded him, suggesting they saw it as harmful.\n\nNow, the moral question is whether the prank was justified. Even if there's a history of conflict, using a prank that causes emotional distress, especially in a public setting during a family event like Christmas, is problematic. The author's actions could be seen as malicious rather than playful. The fact that the family was disappointed indicates that the prank crossed a line. The author's justification that it was \"harmless\" ignores the real emotional impact. So, even if the sister is sensitive, intentionally hurting someone during a family gathering isn't acceptable. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the prank was mean-spirited and caused harm.\n"
