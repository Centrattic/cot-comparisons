She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand it properly.\n\nThe author pranked their sister by giving her a wrapped \"Xbox One\" that was actually an empty case with a rock inside during Christmas, in front of the entire family. The sister was initially happy, thinking it was a real gift, but when she opened it, she was upset and accused the author of ruining her Christmas. The family was disappointed and scolded the author. Now, the author is questioning if they were wrong or if the family is just overreacting because the sister is spoiled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions that their sister was the favorite, leading them to feel like an outcast and using pranks to get attention. They also say their sister \"ruined my life and stole my childhood,\" which suggests some deep-seated resentment. However, the prank itself involved giving a fake Xbox during a family event, which is a significant holiday. \n\nPranks can sometimes be seen as harmless fun, but there are factors to consider. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which might have been embarrassing for the sister. Also, the author used a fake gift that the sister genuinely believed was real, leading to emotional distress. The sister's reaction was strong, indicating that the prank crossed a line for her. \n\nWhile the author might have felt a need to get back at their sister due to past issues, the method chosen could be seen as cruel, especially during a time meant for joy and family bonding. The family's reaction of disappointment and scolding suggests that they found the prank inappropriate. Even if the sister was the favorite, intentionally causing her to cry and ruin a family holiday is likely to be viewed negatively by others. \n\nThe key points here are the setting (a family holiday), the emotional impact on the sister, and the family's collective disapproval. Pranks that humiliate or cause distress, especially in public, are generally considered mean-spirited. The author's history with their sister adds complexity, but the action still seems harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the prank was not harmless. The author's intent might have been to get attention or retaliate, but the execution hurt their sister and upset the family. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
