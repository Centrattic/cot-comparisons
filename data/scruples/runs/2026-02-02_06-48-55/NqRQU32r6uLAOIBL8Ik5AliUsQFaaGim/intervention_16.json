She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt like an outcast and resents their sister for being the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, which led to the sister crying and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of resentment and past conflicts. However, the prank itself was public and during a family event like Christmas. Public humiliation, even if intended as a joke, can be hurtful. The sister's emotional reaction suggests it crossed a line. The family's disapproval also indicates that the prank was inappropriate.\n\nEven though the author might have a history of tension, pranks should still consider the feelings of others. The prank wasn't just a private joke; it happened in front of the entire family, adding to the embarrassment. The sister's reaction of crying and saying \"I hate you\" shows that the prank caused significant emotional distress. The family's disappointment further underscores that the prank was wrong.\n\nThe author's justification of feeling the need to get back at their sister and seeking attention doesn't excuse the prank. Healthy conflict resolution doesn't involve hurting others, especially in a public setting. The prank was not harmless; it caused real emotional harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
