She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast and believing their sister was the favorite. They've had a history of conflict, even mentioning that the sister \"ruined [their] life and stole [their] childhood.\" The prank involved giving a fake Xbox One with a rock inside during Christmas, which led to the sister being upset, and the family being disappointed.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the prank and the impact it had. The author's history of resentment and trying to get back at their sister suggests that this prank wasn't just a lighthearted joke but part of a pattern of negative interactions. Pranks are usually meant to be funny and not hurtful, but this one caused emotional distress. The sister was excited and then disappointed, leading her to cry and say she hated the brother. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, indicating that they saw the prank as inappropriate.\n\nEven if the author considers it a prank, the way it was executed in front of the family and the emotional response it triggered makes it problematic. The motivation to get attention or retaliate over past issues doesn't justify making a family member feel hurt during a sensitive time like Christmas. The family's concern isn't about babying the sister but recognizing that the prank crossed a line from joke to harm.\n\nSo, considering the context, intent, and consequences, the author's actions were inappropriate. The prank wasn't harmless and had a negative impact, which makes the author at fault.\n"
