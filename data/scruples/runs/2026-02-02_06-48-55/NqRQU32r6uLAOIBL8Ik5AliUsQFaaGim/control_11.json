She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The key points here are the context of their complicated relationship, the author's history of feeling like an outcast, and the prank itself.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister was the favorite and that they felt neglected, leading to a strained relationship. They've had a history of conflicts where the author has tried to get back at her. Now, during Christmas, the author pranks her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister reacts negatively, and the family is disappointed.\n\nI need to consider if the prank was harmless or if it crossed a line. Pranks can be okay if they're light-hearted, but this one seems more malicious. The author's intention might have been to get back at her for past issues, which adds a layer of personal resentment. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which could have been embarrassing for the sister. The sister's emotional reaction\u2014crying and running away\u2014indicates that the prank caused real hurt. \n\nAlso, the family's reaction is important. They scolded the author, suggesting that the prank was not seen as harmless. The author's justification that the family is babying the sister might be a defense mechanism. The fact that the prank involved deception (pretending the gift was genuine) and caused distress makes it questionable. \n\nEven if the author had a history of conflict with their sister, using a prank that's meant to humiliate or hurt during a family gathering is likely inappropriate. The context of Christmas, a time meant for celebration, adds to the inappropriateness of the prank. The author's actions might have escalated their existing issues in front of the family, leading to more tension.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the prank wasn't harmless. It was rooted in past grievances and caused emotional harm. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
