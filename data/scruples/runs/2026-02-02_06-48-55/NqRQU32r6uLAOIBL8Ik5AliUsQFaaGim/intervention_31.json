She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author explains their complicated relationship, feeling like an outcast, and that their sister was the favorite. They pranked her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to her emotional reaction and family disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author's motivation seems rooted in past resentment and a history of conflict. Pranks can be harmless, but when they involve emotional harm, especially in a family setting, it's more complicated. The sister was excited, then upset, which the author might have anticipated. The family's reaction suggests they found the prank inappropriate, possibly because it caused distress in front of others.\n\nKey factors: The prank was public, led to the sister crying, and was based on a history of tension. Even if the author intended it as a joke, the emotional impact on the sister and the family's disapproval are significant. The author's justification about past grievances doesn't excuse causing harm in the present. Also, using a family event like Christmas for such a prank adds to the severity.\n\nSo, the prank crossed a line by causing emotional distress and damaging the family's holiday atmosphere. The author's actions, while maybe meant as revenge, were hurtful and not considered harmless. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
