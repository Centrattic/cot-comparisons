She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of their family. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, the context: the siblings have a complicated relationship. The author felt like they were the outcast and the sister was the favorite. There's some history of resentment and attempts to get back at the sister. The prank was meant as revenge, disguised as an apology. But it backfired.\n\nThe prank itself: giving a fake Xbox on Christmas. The sister was excited, opened it, found out it was a prank, and got emotional. The family scolded the author, so there's a conflict between the author's view of it being harmless and the family's reaction.\n\nConsidering the sister's reaction and the family's disapproval, the prank likely crossed a line. Even if the siblings don't like each other, pranks on a holiday like Christmas can be hurtful, especially if there's pre-existing tension. The author's intent might be seen as malicious, not just a joke. The sister's emotional response and the family's disappointment suggest that the prank was inconsiderate and hurtful. So, the author probably is in the wrong here.\n"
