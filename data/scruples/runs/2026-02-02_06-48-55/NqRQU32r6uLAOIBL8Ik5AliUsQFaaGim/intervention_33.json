She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The author mentions a complicated relationship with his sister, feeling like an outcast, and that she was the favorite. He's using this as context, but the key issue here is whether the prank was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the prank. A fake Xbox with a rock sounds like a cruel joke, especially during a family event like Christmas. The sister was excited and then disappointed, which led her to cry and run to her room. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which suggests they found the prank harsh.\n\nThe author justifies it by saying they don't like each other and that the prank was a form of payback. However, pranking someone in a way that causes emotional harm, especially in front of family, crosses a line. It's not just about the prank itself but also the context of their relationship. The author's history of feeling resentful and seeking attention might explain his actions, but it doesn't excuse hurting someone else.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction is important. They were shocked and disappointed, indicating that the prank was socially unacceptable in their eyes. The sister's emotional response further shows the prank was harmful. Even if the author intended it as a joke, the impact was negative, and that's what matters here.\n\nIn terms of whether it's a harmless prank, the answer is no. The prank caused visible distress, so it's not harmless. The author's justification about their complicated relationship might explain his motives, but the action itself is still wrong. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
