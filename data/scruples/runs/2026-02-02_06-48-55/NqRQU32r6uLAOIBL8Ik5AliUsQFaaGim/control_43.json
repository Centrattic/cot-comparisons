She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister during Christmas. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic where the author felt neglected and resented their sister, who was the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and the family's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author mentions a history of tension, feeling like an outcast, and using pranks as a way to get attention. The prank itself was done in front of the entire family, which adds a public shaming element. The sister was excited, expecting a real gift, and the prank led to her crying and running off. The family reacted negatively, scolding the author.\n\nNow, considering the prank's nature: giving an expensive-looking item that's a fake, especially during a time like Christmas, could be seen as cruel. The author's intent might have been to get back at the sister, but the method involved public humiliation and causing emotional distress. Even if there's a history of conflict, the prank crosses into mean-spirited territory. The family's reaction suggests they viewed it as hurtful rather than harmless. The sister's strong negative reaction (\"I hate you\") indicates that the prank had a significant emotional impact. \n\nThe author's justification is that it was a prank and the family is just overreacting. However, pranks should generally be light-hearted and not cause genuine harm. This prank caused distress and ruined the sister's Christmas, which many would see as going too far. The public setting amplifies the hurt, as it's in front of family who then disapproved. \n\nWhile the author's feelings of neglect are valid, using a prank that harms a sibling emotionally isn't an appropriate way to address those feelings. Healthy conflict resolution would involve communication rather than pranks that cause pain. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The prank was mean-spirited, hurtful, and contributed to a negative family dynamic, making the answer A.\n"
