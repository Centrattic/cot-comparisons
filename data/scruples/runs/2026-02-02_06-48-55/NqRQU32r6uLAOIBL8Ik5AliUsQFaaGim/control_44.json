She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for pranking their sister. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the sister was the favorite and the author felt like an outcast. They've been trying to get back at her over the years and decided to prank her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside during Christmas. The sister was upset, and the family scolded the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of feeling neglected and a strained relationship with their sister. The prank was done in front of the entire family during a holiday, which is a sensitive time. The sister's reaction was strong, crying and feeling her Christmas was ruined. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent behind the prank and the impact it had. The author intended to get back at their sister for past grievances. Pranks can be playful, but this one seems to have been rooted in past resentment rather than just for fun. The prank involved deception (giving a fake item) and caused emotional distress, especially during a time meant for family bonding and joy. The sister's reaction indicates it was hurtful, not funny.\n\nEven if the author felt wronged in the past, using a prank that publicly humiliates or disappoints their sister, especially during a significant event like Christmas, crosses a line. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank was seen as cruel or inconsiderate, not just a harmless joke. The sister's statement \"I hate you\" shows the prank had a negative effect on their relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and typical expectations around pranks, especially during holidays, causing emotional harm is generally not acceptable. Pranks should be light-hearted and not make others feel embarrassed or upset. The author's motive of revenge complicates the matter, making it less about humor and more about causing suffering. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
