She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The context is a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt neglected and resented the sister for being the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock instead, leading to emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the prank. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm, especially in a public setting like a family gathering, they might cross a line. The author's motivation is rooted in past resentment and a desire for attention. However, using a prank that leads to the sister crying and feeling ruined Christmas could be seen as cruel, even if the intent was to get back at her.\n\nThe family's reaction is also important. They were disappointed and scolded the author, which suggests that the prank was considered inappropriate. Public humiliation and causing someone to feel their Christmas was ruined might be too harsh, even for a prank. The sister's reaction of hating the brother and running off crying indicates significant emotional impact.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions a history of a complicated relationship, but that doesn't excuse harmful actions. While the author felt neglected, retaliating with a prank that causes such distress might not be justified. The line between a joke and cruelty can be thin, and in this case, it seems the prank went overboard, especially in front of the family.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's prank likely caused unnecessary harm and disrespect, making them the asshole.\n"
