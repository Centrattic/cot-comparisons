She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast and the sister was the favorite. The author has been trying to get back at her over the years. This Christmas, they gave a prank \"gift\" instead of a real Xbox. The sister was happy, opened it in front of the family, then realized it was a fake and got upset. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nThe key points here are: the prank involved deception (giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside), it was done in front of the whole family, and it made the sister cry. The author's motivation includes past resentment and a desire for attention, which might be relevant to their maturity in handling the situation.\n\nNow, considering if it's a harmless prank or not. Pranks can be okay if they're light-hearted and not meant to harm. But in this case, the prank caused emotional distress. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, saying she hates the author, ruining her Christmas. The family's disapproval suggests they found it inappropriate. \n\nThe author's reasoning that it's just a prank might overlook the emotional impact. Even if the intention was to get back at the sister, using a family event like Christmas as a setting for a prank that humiliates someone in front of others is problematic. It can be seen as cruel or mean-spirited, especially given the existing tension.\n\nAlso, the context of their complicated relationship adds weight. The author's past feelings of being an outcast and the sister being the favorite might influence their actions, but that doesn't justify hurting someone else. The family's reaction indicates they value the emotional well-being of their members, so the author's actions conflict with that value.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, pranks that lead to humiliation or hurt feelings are generally frowned upon, especially in family settings. The prank was not just a joke but a setup to embarrass and disappoint the sister during a significant event. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the prank crossed the line from harmless fun to something hurtful. The author's actions caused distress, and their justification based on past grievances doesn't excuse the harm done. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
