She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt like an outcast and resents their sister. The prank was giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and family backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions a history of feeling neglected and using pranks to get attention. However, the prank in question was during a family event, Christmas, which is a time when people expect gifts and might be more sensitive to pranks. The author's action might have been intended as a joke, but the sister took it seriously and got upset. The family's reaction was disappointment rather than humor, suggesting that the prank crossed a line.\n\nNext, the key question is whether the prank was harmful. The sister cried, felt her Christmas was ruined, and ran to her room. This indicates emotional harm. Pranks can be acceptable if they don't cause lasting harm or distress. The author might argue it was a joke, but the sister's reaction suggests it wasn't harmless. The family's disapproval also points to a cultural or social norm where such pranks are not appropriate, especially during a significant family event.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intent versus the impact. Even if the intention was to get back at the sister or get attention, the impact was negative. The sister's emotional response and the family's scolding indicate that the prank was not well-received. The author's history of a complicated relationship might explain the motivation, but it doesn't justify the action if it caused harm.\n\nAlso, the public nature of the prank in front of the entire family adds weight. Pranks in such settings can be more hurtful because they're performative, potentially embarrassing the target and causing family tension. The family's reaction of disappointment suggests that the prank violated their expectations of respect and kindness during a holiday.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prank likely went beyond a harmless joke. The emotional distress caused to the sister and the negative family reaction indicate that the author's actions were inappropriate. Even if the author had a history of conflict with the sister, using a prank in a sensitive context like Christmas, especially in front of the family, was a misstep. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
