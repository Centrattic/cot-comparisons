She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the nature of the prank, and the family's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast and the sister was the favorite, leading to long-standing resentment. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, which the sister was excited about but then upset when she realized it was a prank. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nNow, considering the prank itself: giving a fake gift that the recipient was excited about, leading to emotional distress. Even if pranks can be harmless, the context here is important. The author had a history of wanting to get back at the sister, and the prank caused her to cry and feel her Christmas was ruined. The public nature of the prank in front of the family adds to the humiliation factor. Family members reacting with disapproval suggests that the prank crossed a line, especially if it caused harm or embarrassment. \n\nThe author's justification is that the prank was supposed to be funny, but the sister's reaction and the family's disapproval indicate it wasn't well-received. The sister's emotional response (\"I hate you,\" crying) shows it was hurtful, not just funny. The family's reaction (disappointment, scolding) supports the idea that the prank was inappropriate. Even if the author felt wronged in the past, using a prank that causes emotional pain isn't justified. The key here is whether the prank was harmless. Since it led to significant negative reactions, it's more harmful than harmless. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they targeted someone who was emotionally vulnerable and caused distress in a public setting, which the family found unacceptable.\n"
