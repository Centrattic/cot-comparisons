She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author explains their complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast, the sister was the favorite, and they've had a history of conflict. The prank involved giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside during Christmas. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author's motivations are rooted in past feelings of neglect and resentment. However, pranks can be seen as a form of revenge, especially given their history. The key points here are the intention, the setting, and the consequences.\n\nIntention: The author wanted to get back at their sister, using a prank that caused emotional distress. The act was done in front of the entire family, which adds pressure and public embarrassment, which might be harsh.\n\nSetting: Christmas is a time for family togetherness. Pranking during such an event could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it disrupts the festive mood. The author might have thought it was funny, but the family's reaction suggests otherwise.\n\nConsequences: The sister was clearly hurt, crying, and ran off. The family scolded the author, indicating that the prank went too far. Even if the author sees it as harmless, the impact on others matters.\n\nThe author's history with their sister complicates things. While past issues might explain the motivation, that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Pranks are usually meant to be light-hearted, but this one caused significant emotional harm. The act of giving a fake gift, especially during a meaningful time like Christmas, crossed a line. The family's disappointment suggests that the prank was not seen as humorous but as cruel.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author had a history of tension, the prank was hurtful and done in a public setting, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
