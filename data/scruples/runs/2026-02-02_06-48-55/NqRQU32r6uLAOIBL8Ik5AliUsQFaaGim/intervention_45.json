She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like they were neglected in favor of her. The prank involved giving an empty Xbox box with a rock, leading to emotional reactions from the sister and disapproval from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension, feeling like an outcast, and a desire to get back at their sister. The prank happened during Christmas, a time meant for family celebrations, which adds weight to the situation. The prank caused the sister to cry and run off, and the family was disappointed. \n\nNow, evaluating the prank itself. A fake Xbox with a rock is a classic prank, but the setting and the individuals involved matter. The sister was already emotionally vulnerable, and the prank was done in front of the entire family, which could be seen as public shaming. The author's motivation might be part of the issue\u2014using the prank as a form of retaliation for past feelings of neglect. \n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the sister, the family's reaction, and the appropriateness of the prank in a family gathering. Even if pranks are common, this one seems to have crossed a line by causing distress and damaging the festive atmosphere. The author's actions might be seen as malicious rather than harmless, especially given the history. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the prank caused emotional harm, was done in a sensitive context, and reflects unresolved personal issues rather than a lighthearted joke.\n"
