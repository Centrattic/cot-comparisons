She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author feels neglected and resents their sister. The prank involved giving an empty Xbox box with a rock, which upset the sister, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of feeling like an outcast and used pranks to get attention. The sister was the favored child, which added to the tension. The prank was public, during a family gathering, which might have made it more hurtful. The sister was genuinely excited and then cried, leading to family disapproval.\n\nNow, evaluating the prank itself. The author's intention was to get back at the sister, using a fake gift. While the author sees it as harmless, the sister and family found it hurtful. The prank caused emotional distress, which is a red flag. Even if the author and sister have a bad relationship, public humiliation and emotional harm are serious. The family's reaction suggests that the prank crossed a line. \n\nThe key points are: the prank was in front of the family, it caused the sister to cry, family members were disappointed, and the author's history of resentment. The author might argue it was a joke, but the impact on others matters. Pranks that cause emotional harm, especially in public, are generally not considered harmless. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
