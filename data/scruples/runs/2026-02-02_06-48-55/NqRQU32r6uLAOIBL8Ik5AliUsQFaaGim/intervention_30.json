She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves pranking their sister during Christmas by giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The writer has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling neglected and having resentment. They pulled this prank in front of the whole family, leading to the sister being upset and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer mentions a history of being picked on by the sister and feeling like an outcast. That might explain their motivation, but does that justify the prank? Pranks can be harmless, but they need to be appropriate and not hurtful. The key factors here are the intent, the nature of the prank, and the impact on others.\n\nThe prank involved deception and causing emotional distress. The sister was excited about the gift, only to be disappointed and humiliated in front of the family. Even if the writer intended it as a joke, the outcome was that the sister felt hurt, and the family was upset. The family's reaction suggests they saw it as crossing a line, especially during a sensitive time like Christmas.\n\nAlso, the writer's history of resentment might influence their judgment. They mention having a complicated relationship and using pranks as a way to get attention. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse behavior that harms others. The prank was public, which adds to the humiliation factor. The sister's reaction of crying and hating the writer indicates it was painful for her.\n\nAre there cultural or familial norms that might affect this? The family's disapproval is a strong indicator that they don't find it funny. The writer's justification that it's \"just a prank\" might not hold weight if it's causing real harm. The fact that the family scolded them suggests that the prank went against their values.\n\nIn terms of ethics, intent matters, but the consequences also do. Even if the writer didn't mean to hurt, the result was hurt and disappointment. The prank might be seen as cruel, especially given the sister's history of being the favorite. The writer's actions could be perceived as seeking revenge or attention in a hurtful way.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there's context of a troubled relationship, the prank was likely inappropriate and hurtful. The family's reaction supports the idea that the writer overstepped. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
