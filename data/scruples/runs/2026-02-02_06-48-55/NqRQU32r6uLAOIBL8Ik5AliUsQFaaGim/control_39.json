She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The story describes a complicated sibling relationship where the author feels they were an outcast and the sister was favored. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and family disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the prank. The author set up the gift as an apology, which could be seen as insincere if there's no real intention to reconcile. The prank caused the sister to cry and ruined her Christmas, which is significant emotional impact. The family's reaction was disappointment, suggesting they found the prank inappropriate.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the prank was harmless, but the sister's strong negative reaction and the family's scolding indicate it wasn't harmless. The context of their strained relationship might mean the prank was more hurtful. Even if there's a history of conflict, pranks that cause emotional distress are generally not considered acceptable, especially in front of others. The author used the sister's happiness as a setup to then disappoint her, which can be seen as cruel. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while pranks can be light-hearted, this one crossed a line by causing genuine harm and undermining a positive moment. The family's reaction supports the idea that the prank was inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
