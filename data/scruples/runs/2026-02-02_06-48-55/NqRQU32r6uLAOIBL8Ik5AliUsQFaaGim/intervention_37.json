She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who pulled a prank on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank where instead of giving an actual Xbox, they gave an empty box with a rock. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast, and a history of picking on her. The prank was done in front of the entire family. The author's intention might have been to get back at their sister, but the execution involved public humiliation, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) Was the prank harmful or just a joke? 2) Did the author consider the sister's feelings, especially given their history? 3) How did the family react? The sister was clearly hurt, and the family was disappointed. The author's justification is that it's a harmless prank, but others might see it as malicious due to the context of their relationship.\n\nThe sister's reaction was emotional, indicating that the prank affected her deeply. The author's history of resentment and the public nature of the prank in front of the family likely made it worse. Even if pranks are common, this one might cross a line into emotional harm, especially with the existing tensions. The family's disapproval also suggests that the prank wasn't seen as harmless by them. So, the author's actions, while possibly intended as a joke, caused real emotional distress and may have been inconsiderate given their past. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
