She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pranking a sister during Christmas. The author explains their complicated relationship with their sister, mentioning that she was the favorite and that they felt like an outcast. The prank involved giving an empty Xbox box with a rock inside during a family gathering. The sister was upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of resentment towards the sister, feeling overlooked. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which adds pressure. The sister was genuinely excited about the gift, and the prank caused her emotional distress. \n\nNow, pranks can be harmless, but the key factors here might be the setting and the emotional impact. The author used a holiday, which is supposed to be a joyful time, to carry out a prank that led to the sister crying and the family being upset. The family's reaction suggests that they didn't find it funny, which might indicate that the prank crossed a line, especially in a public family setting.\n\nThe author's intent might be revenge or to gain attention, given their backstory. However, using a prank that causes emotional harm, especially during a family event, could be seen as malicious rather than a joke. The sister's reaction and the family's disapproval are significant. Even if there was a history of conflict, escalating it during a family gathering with a public humiliation might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the sister \"ruined my life and stole my childhood,\" which is a strong statement. However, using a prank that makes her cry in front of others could be seen as unkind, regardless of past issues. The family's disappointment also points to the prank being inappropriate in that context.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the prank likely went too far, leading to the author being in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
