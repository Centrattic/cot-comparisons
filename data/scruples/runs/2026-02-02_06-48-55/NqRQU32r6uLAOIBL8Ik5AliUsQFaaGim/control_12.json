She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a complicated relationship. The sister was the favorite, which made the author feel like an outcast. This led to years of tension and resentment. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox as an apology, which made the sister upset and caused family backlash.\n\nNow, considering the prank itself. Giving a fake Xbox as a \"gift\" in front of the family seems intentionally hurtful. The sister was excited, only to be disappointed in front of everyone. The author even mentions that the sister reacted strongly, feeling it ruined Christmas. The family was disappointed and scolded the author, which suggests the prank wasn't harmless.\n\nEven if there's a history of conflict, pranks should ideally not cause emotional harm. The setup was misleading, and the public humiliation might have crossed a line. The author's justification about their sister being spoiled and ruining their childhood doesn't excuse the prank. Everyone deserves to feel respected, even in a conflict.\n\nAlso, the prank didn't seem to have a good-natured intent. It was more about getting back at her in front of the family, which could be seen as spiteful. The family's reaction indicates they saw it as harmful, not just a joke. So, the author likely is in the wrong.\n"
