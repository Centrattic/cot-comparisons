She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast growing up, and the sister was the favorite, leading to resentment. The author has a history of pranking her as a way to get attention. Now they did a prank where they gave her a fake Xbox with a rock inside during Christmas, which upset her a lot. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the key factors here. Pranks can sometimes be harmless, but they need to be appropriate. The author's motivation is important. They mentioned a history of using pranks to get attention and retaliate against their sister, which suggests a pattern of behavior rooted in negative emotions. The prank in question was during a family event, Christmas, which is supposed to be a time for joy and togetherness. The prank involved deception, leading to the sister's emotional distress. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which indicates that the prank went beyond what's acceptable in their eyes.\n\nAlso, the sister was already sensitive because the author had a history of targeting her. The prank wasn't just a joke; it caused her to cry and run off, which is a strong emotional reaction. The author might not see it as harmful, but the impact on the sister and the family is significant. Even if the author intended it as a joke, causing emotional harm and ruining an important family event is problematic. \n\nThe author's long-standing resentment and the method of pranking during a sensitive time contribute to why it's considered wrong. The family's reaction isn't just \"babying\" the sister; it's about the prank being inappropriate and hurtful. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
