She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister was really upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt neglected and resented her being the favorite. This led to years of picking on her and trying to get back at her. The prank was done in front of the entire family during Christmas, a time meant for joy. \n\nNow, pranks can be okay if they're consensual and not harmful. But here, the prank caused emotional distress. The sister was crying and said \"I hate you\" and \"ruined my Christmas.\" The family reacted with disappointment and scolded the author. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the impact. The author's actions were deliberate, using a fake expensive gift during a sensitive time. Even if the intention was to get back at her, it's not an excuse. The prank wasn't harmless because it hurt someone and ruined a family event. The author's history of trying to get back at her might imply a pattern of behavior, not a one-time joke. \n\nAlso, pranking in front of family can lead to embarrassment and escalate conflicts. The sister's reaction shows it was hurtful. The author might not have considered how the prank would affect her emotionally, especially given their already strained relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author might see it as a joke, the impact was negative. Family reactions also indicate it wasn't well-received. The author's justification about past issues doesn't excuse the current harmful action. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer is A.\n"
