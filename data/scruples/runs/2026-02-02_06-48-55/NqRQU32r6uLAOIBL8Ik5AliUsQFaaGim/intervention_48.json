She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The key points here are the context of their relationship and the nature of the prank.\n\nFirst, the author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast and that their sister was the favorite, which led to resentment. They've had a history of conflict and pranks. The prank in question involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside during Christmas. The sister was excited, opened it in front of the family, then upset when it was a fake. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nNow, considering the prank's context: it's during a family gathering, a time meant for celebration. The sister's initial excitement suggests she trusted the gift was genuine. The prank caused her emotional distress, leading to her crying and running off. The family's reaction was disappointment, indicating they felt the prank was out of line.\n\nPranks can be harmless, but this one seems to cross a line. The author's history of resentment and wanting revenge might have influenced the prank's severity. The public setting and the sister's emotional response suggest it wasn't harmless. Even if the author intended it as a joke, causing someone to cry and ruin their Christmas is likely too harsh, especially in front of family. The sister's reaction and the family's disapproval point to the prank being inconsiderate and hurtful. So, the answer is A.\n"
