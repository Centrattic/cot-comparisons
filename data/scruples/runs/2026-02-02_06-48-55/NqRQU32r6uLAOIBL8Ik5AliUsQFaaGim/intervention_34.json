She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister. The situation is that the author and sister have a complicated relationship, with the author feeling like they were the outcast and the sister being the favorite. The author pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox filled with a rock, leading to her crying and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension and feeling overlooked. The prank was done in front of the entire family during Christmas, which is a significant and emotional time. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying and saying she hates the author. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the prank was appropriate. Pranks can be okay if they're lighthearted and not hurtful, but this one resulted in emotional distress. The author's intention might have been revenge or to get attention, given the history. However, the method chosen was cruel and public. During a family gathering, especially a holiday, such a prank could be seen as particularly harsh. Even if there's a history of conflict, the prank crossed a line by causing intentional hurt and embarrassment in front of others. The sister's reaction indicates it was hurtful, and the family's disapproval suggests that the prank was not seen as harmless. So, while there's context, the prank's impact and the setting make the author responsible for the hurt caused. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
