She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family during Christmas. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author feels like they were an outcast because their sister was the favorite and spoiled. This led to resentment and a desire to get back at her. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox (a box with a rock) as a Christmas gift, which made the sister cry and the family scold the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the intent behind the prank, the context, and the consequences. The author's motivation was revenge for feeling neglected, not just a light-hearted joke. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which is a public setting, and it caused emotional distress to the sister. The sister's reaction was strong, and the family was disappointed, which adds to the impact.\n\nEven if the author intended it as a joke, the act of giving a gift that appears genuine but is actually a fake, especially with a history of a strained relationship, could be seen as cruel. The sister was excited and then felt betrayed, leading her to say she hates the author and ruin Christmas for her. The family's disapproval suggests that they found it in poor taste, especially during a family event like Christmas which is supposed to be joyous.\n\nThe author might argue that the family is overreacting, but pranks that cause emotional harm, especially when there's a history of conflict, are generally considered going too far. The line between a harmless prank and an asshole move is blurry here, but the result was hurt feelings and a ruined holiday. The sister's emotional response and the family's disappointment indicate that the prank was not harmless. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
