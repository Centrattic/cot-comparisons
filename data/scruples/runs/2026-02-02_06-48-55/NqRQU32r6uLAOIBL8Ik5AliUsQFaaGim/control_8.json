She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox One for Christmas, which was just an empty case with a rock inside. The sister was upset, cried, and the family was disappointed. The author is asking if they're the asshole or if the family is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast, and having a history of picking on her. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which might have made it more public and hurtful.\n\nPranks can be okay if they're light-hearted and not mean-spirited. But in this case, the author had a history of resentment and using pranks as a way to get back at their sister. The prank resulted in the sister crying and feeling that her Christmas was ruined. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, which suggests they didn't see it as harmless.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to get back at their sister and maybe provoke a reaction, especially given the history. The impact was significant emotional distress on the sister and family. Even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, the prank crossed a line by causing real harm and embarrassment in front of others. The family's reaction isn't just \"babying\" the sister; it's about recognizing that the prank was hurtful. So, the author's actions were likely wrong because they prioritized their own amusement over their sister's feelings and the family's values. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
