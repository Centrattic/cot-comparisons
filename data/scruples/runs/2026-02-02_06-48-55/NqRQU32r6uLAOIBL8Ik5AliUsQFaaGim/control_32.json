She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a prank he played on his sister during Christmas. He gave her a fake Xbox with a rock inside, pretending it was an apology gift. The sister was excited, opened it, got upset, and the family was disappointed.\n\nFirst, pranks can be tricky. They can be seen as funny or mean depending on context and how they're received. The author mentions a complicated relationship with his sister, feeling like he was an outcast, and that she was the favorite. He's been trying to get back at her for years. This prank is part of that ongoing dynamic.\n\nThe key points here are intent, impact, and the setting. The prank was done in front of the entire family during Christmas, which is a time for joy and togetherness. The sister was genuinely excited, leading to her emotional reaction. The author's motivation includes past resentment, which might have influenced the prank's harshness.\n\nPranks are usually meant to be light-hearted, but when they cause emotional harm, especially in a sensitive environment like a family gathering, they can be seen as crossing a line. The family's reaction of disappointment suggests that the prank was inconsiderate of the sister's feelings and the occasion. The sister's response\u2014crying and saying it ruined her Christmas\u2014shows the negative impact.\n\nEven if the author intended it as a joke, the method and timing were problematic. Using a fake gift that looks real, given the history of their relationship, might not be a harmless prank. The fact that the family scolded him indicates that the prank was not well-received and was likely hurtful.\n\nSo, considering the context, the emotional impact on the sister, and the family's disapproval, it seems the author did cross a line. The prank wasn't just a joke but was rooted in long-standing issues, making it hurtful rather than harmless.\n"
