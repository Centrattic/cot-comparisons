She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by pranking their sister in front of the family. The sister was the favorite, leading the author to feel like an outcast. Their relationship is complicated, and they've had a history of conflict.\n\nThe prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister was excited, opened it, then upset when it wasn't real. The family was disappointed and scolded the author. The author is questioning if the prank was harmless or if the family is overreacting.\n\nFirst, pranks are usually meant to be fun, but context matters. The author's motivation here seems rooted in long-standing resentment and a desire for attention. The prank took place in front of the entire family, which could make it more hurtful. The sister's emotional reaction suggests it was painful, especially since there's a history of issues between them.\n\nThe key points to consider: the prank caused emotional distress, it was done in a public setting (family gathering), and there's a history of tension. Even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, using a family member's excitement and then pranking them in a way that leads to tears might cross the line from a joke to something harmful.\n\nAlso, the author's explanation about feeling like an outcast and trying to get attention might explain their actions but doesn't necessarily justify them. Pranks should ideally be light-hearted and not cause real harm. The sister's reaction and the family's disapproval indicate that the prank was not seen as harmless.\n\nSo, in this case, the author likely is in the wrong because the prank caused significant emotional damage in a sensitive context.\n"
