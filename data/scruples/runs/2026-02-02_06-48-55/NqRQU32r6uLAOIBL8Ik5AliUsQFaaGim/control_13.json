She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family. They have a complicated relationship where the sister was the favorite, leading the author to feel like an outcast. They mention a history of conflict and wanting to get back at her.\n\nThe prank involved giving a fake Xbox, which made the sister cry. The family was disappointed and scolded them. The author is wondering if the prank was okay or if the family is just being too soft on the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the prank was malicious. The author admits they have a long-standing resentment towards their sister. The prank caused emotional distress, leading to the sister crying and feeling her Christmas was ruined. Even if it's a prank, causing someone to cry, especially in front of family, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe context of their relationship matters. If there's a history of conflict and the prank is meant as revenge or to get attention, that adds a layer of intent. The family's reaction suggests they found it inappropriate. Pranks are usually meant to be funny, but if they cause harm, that's an issue. \n\nAlso, the public nature of the prank in front of the entire family might be worse. It's not just a private joke that both parties can handle; it's in front of others, which can humiliate or embarrass someone. The sister's reaction indicates it hurt her feelings significantly. \n\nEven if the author sees it as harmless, the impact on the sister is real. The family's disapproval implies that the prank was not well-received, which could mean the author did something wrong. Intentions might be part of it, but the outcome is important too. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the prank likely went too far, especially given the emotional response and the family's reaction. The author might be in the wrong because pranks should ideally be light-hearted and not cause genuine harm or distress.\n"
