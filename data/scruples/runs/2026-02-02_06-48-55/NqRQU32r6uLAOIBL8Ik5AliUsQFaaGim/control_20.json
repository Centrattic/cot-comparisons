She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is the asshole (AITA) for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author explains their complicated relationship, feeling like they were the outcast and the sister was the favorite. They pranked her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to her emotional reaction and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the prank was appropriate. The key points are the context of their relationship and the nature of the prank. The author mentions a history of conflict where they felt they had to act out to be noticed. However, the prank here was in front of the entire family, which might have been more hurtful because of the public nature.\n\nThe sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, saying she hates the author and that it ruined Christmas. The family scolded the author, indicating they didn't find it funny. Even if there's a history of rivalry, this prank seems to cross a line. It's not just a harmless joke because it caused real emotional distress. Also, giving a fake gift as an apology might be seen as mocking, especially if the sister was genuinely looking forward to it. The author might be projecting their own feelings of being overlooked, but using a prank that harms someone else's holiday experience is questionable. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank wasn't considered harmless. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
