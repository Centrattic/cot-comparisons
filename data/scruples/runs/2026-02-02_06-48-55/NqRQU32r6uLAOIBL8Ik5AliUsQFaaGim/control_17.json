She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has a complicated relationship with their sister. They felt like an outcast and the sister was the favorite. The author has a history of trying to get back at her. The prank involves giving a fake Xbox with a rock, leading to the sister being upset and the family reacting negatively.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's motivation seems rooted in past resentment and a desire for revenge, not just a light-hearted joke. Pranks are usually meant to be harmless fun, but this one caused emotional distress. The sister ended up crying and feeling her Christmas was ruined. The family was disappointed, which suggests that the prank crossed a social boundary.\n\nAlso, doing it in front of the entire family adds pressure and humiliation. Even if the author saw it as harmless, the negative reaction from both the sister and family indicates it wasn't appropriate. The author's history of conflict might explain their actions, but it doesn't justify the prank's impact. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
