She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for pranking their sister. The story involves a complicated sibling relationship where the sister was the favorite, leading to feelings of being an outcast. The author pranked the sister by giving her a fake Xbox filled with a rock instead of a real one, leading to her emotional reaction and the family scolding the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author mentions a history of tension with their sister, where they feel they had to act out to be noticed. However, the prank itself seems to have caused significant emotional harm. The sister cried, felt her Christmas was ruined, and the family was disappointed. \n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. While the author might have intended it as a harmless prank, the result was emotional distress for the sister. Even with a complicated relationship, pranks that cause such strong negative reactions can be harmful. The author's justification of past grievances doesn't mitigate the immediate harm caused. Additionally, doing this in front of the entire family adds public humiliation, which is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nThe family's reaction indicates that the prank crossed a line. They scolded the author, suggesting that the prank wasn't seen as acceptable. The sister's emotional response (\"I hate you\", ran crying) shows the prank had a real negative impact. Even if the author feels the family is \"babying\" the sister, the fact remains that the prank caused harm. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because the prank was cruel and caused unnecessary emotional pain, despite the underlying issues. The intent might be rooted in a history of conflict, but the action itself was inappropriate and hurtful.\n"
