She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of family. The story is that the author and sister have a complicated history, with the sister being the favorite and the author feeling like an outcast. The author has a history of trying to get back at her. This time, during Christmas, the author gave a fake Xbox as a prank, which led to the sister crying and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the prank was inappropriate. Pranks can be tricky. If the intention is to cause harm or humiliation, that's a red flag. The author's motivation here seems to be rooted in past grievances and a desire to get back at the sister. The prank was done in front of the entire family, which adds a public humiliation aspect. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, saying she hates the author, and feeling her Christmas was ruined. The family's response was disappointment and scolding, which suggests they found the prank hurtful.\n\nThe author frames the prank as a joke, but the sister's emotional response indicates it wasn't harmless. The context of their relationship complicates things. Past actions matter here. If the sister was the favorite and the author has a history of pranks or retaliation, this might be part of a pattern. The prank's public nature could be especially damaging, as it's in front of the whole family, which might have been intended to embarrass the sister further.\n\nThe key elements here are the intent, the effect on the sister, and the public setting. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the outcome was harmful. Pranks should consider the other person's feelings and the context of the relationship. The fact that the family was disappointed adds another layer, showing that the prank violated social norms or family expectations about holidays and respect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the prank caused significant emotional harm, was done in a public setting during a family event, and was rooted in past resentment rather than a benign joke. The sister's reaction and the family's disapproval indicate it crossed a line.\n"
