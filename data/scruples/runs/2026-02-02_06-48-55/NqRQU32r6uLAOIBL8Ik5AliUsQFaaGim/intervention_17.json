She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank where the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a rock inside, pretending it was a real Xbox. The sister was upset, and the family scolded the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast, and a history of conflict. The prank was done in front of the entire family during Christmas, which is a sensitive time. The sister was genuinely excited, opened the gift, and then discovered it was a prank, leading to her emotional reaction.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. Pranks can be a gray area, but there are some key factors here. The prank caused emotional distress to the sister, and the family was disappointed. The author's intent might have been to get back at their sister, given the history. However, the method\u2014during a family event where the sister was looking forward to a genuine gift\u2014seems to cross into harmful territory. \n\nEven if the author intended it as a joke, the impact was negative. The sister's reaction of crying and stating she hates them indicates it was hurtful. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank was inappropriate, especially in a public setting during a celebration. The author's justification that it's just a prank might not take into account the emotional impact on the sister and the family dynamics. \n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions, while possibly rooted in a history of conflict, still resulted in hurting their sister and straining family relations. It's important to acknowledge the harm caused, regardless of past issues. So, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
