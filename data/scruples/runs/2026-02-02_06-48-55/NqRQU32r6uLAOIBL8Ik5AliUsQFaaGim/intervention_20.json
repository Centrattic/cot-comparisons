She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by pranking their sister in front of the family. The author explains their complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast, and using pranks to get attention. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister being upset and the family scolding the author.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's intention was to get back at their sister for feeling neglected. They took a prank that turned out to be mean, causing emotional harm. The sister was genuinely excited and then hurt, which the author might not have considered. The family's reaction was disappointment, which the author dismisses as \"babying\" her. \n\nIs the prank harmless? Well, the sister ended up crying and running to her room. The author didn't consider her feelings in the moment. Even if the relationship is contentious, this prank went too far, especially in front of the family. The family's disappointment suggests that the prank wasn't appropriate. The author's justification about their past might explain their actions but doesn't necessarily excuse them. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The prank was hurtful, and the consequences were significant for the sister. The author's actions disrupted a family event and caused emotional distress. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
