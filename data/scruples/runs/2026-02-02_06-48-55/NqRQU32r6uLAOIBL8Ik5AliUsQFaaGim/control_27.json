She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The story involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author feels neglected and resents their sister for being the favorite. The prank was giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside as an apology gift, which led to the sister crying and the family being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the prank. The author mentions a history of tension and that this prank was a form of retaliation. However, even if there's a history of conflict, a prank that causes emotional harm, especially in front of family, might cross a line. The sister was genuinely upset and felt her Christmas was ruined. The family's reaction was disappointment, indicating they saw it as harmful.\n\nNext, the context of the prank. It was during a family event (Christmas), which is supposed to be a time for joy and togetherness. Pranking someone in such a setting, especially when it leads to public embarrassment and emotional distress, could be seen as inappropriate. The author's justification is that it was a harmless prank, but the sister's reaction shows it wasn't. The prank involved deception that led to her crying, which is a strong indicator of it being hurtful.\n\nThe author's relationship with their sister is tense, but that doesn't excuse actions that cause pain. The prank might have been intended as a joke, but the outcome was negative. The family's disapproval suggests they believe the prank was inconsiderate. Even if there's a history of conflict, this incident might be seen as taking it too far, especially considering the public nature and the emotional impact.\n\nAlso, the author used a gift as a means of apology but then turned it into a prank. This could be seen as mocking their sister's hope for a genuine apology, adding insult to injury. The sister's reaction of \"I hate you\" and running off shows a significant emotional impact. The family's scolding reflects that they view this as a serious issue, not just a minor joke.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while pranks can be light-hearted, they should avoid causing harm. The line between a prank and bullying or emotional abuse can be thin. Given the sister's vulnerability and the context of their relationship, the prank might be considered a harmful act rather than a harmless joke.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions caused emotional distress in a sensitive setting, leading to family disappointment. Even with their complicated history, the prank's impact justifies the family's reaction. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
