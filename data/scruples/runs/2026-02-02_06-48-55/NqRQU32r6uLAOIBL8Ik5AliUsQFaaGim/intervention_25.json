She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author feels they were neglected and the sister was the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister being upset and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension, feeling like they had to get attention by pranking the sister. The prank was done in front of the entire family during Christmas, which is a significant event. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, running away, saying she hates the author. The family was also disappointed and scolded the author. \n\nThe key points to evaluate are: Was the prank harmless or cruel? Did the author consider the sister's feelings? Is the prank appropriate for the setting (family gathering)? The sister's emotional response suggests it hurt her, and the family's reaction indicates they saw it as inconsiderate. The author's justification is that it was a prank, but the context of their relationship and the public setting might make it more harmful than intended.\n\nHarmless pranks usually don't cause emotional distress. Since the sister was already sensitive due to their complicated history, the prank likely crossed a line. The public humiliation aspect during a family event adds to the severity. The author's intent might have been to get attention or retaliate, but the method caused significant emotional harm. The family's disapproval supports that the prank was inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because the prank caused emotional harm and was done in a context where it could damage family relationships further. The answer would be A.\n"
