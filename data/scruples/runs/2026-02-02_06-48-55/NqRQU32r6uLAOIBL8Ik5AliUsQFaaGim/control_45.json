She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author describes their complicated relationship with their sister. They mention feeling like an outcast and that their sister was the favorite, leading to resentment and a history of pranks. The specific prank here was giving an empty Xbox box with a rock instead of an actual console during Christmas. The sister was excited, opened it, then upset when it was a fake. The family was disappointed and scolded the author.\n\nNow, I need to consider if this is a reasonable prank or if it went too far. Pranks can be okay if they're lighthearted and not harmful. However, this was in front of the whole family during a significant holiday. The sister was genuinely excited, expecting a real Xbox, which is an expensive item. The author's intention might have been to get back at her for past grievances, but the context is important. \n\nGiving a fake Xbox as a Christmas gift could be seen as cruel because it's a time when people expect joy and generosity. The sister's reaction\u2014crying and saying it ruined her Christmas\u2014suggests emotional harm. The family's disapproval also indicates that the prank was not perceived as harmless. The author's history of wanting to get back at their sister adds a layer of malice, making it less about a joke and more about revenge. \n\nEven if the author intended it as a prank, the method and timing might have been inconsiderate. The sister's feelings of being the favorite and the author's feelings of being an outcast create a dynamic where such a prank could be particularly hurtful. The fact that the family reacted negatively supports the idea that the prank crossed a line, especially during a family gathering where maintaining harmony is important. \n\nSo, considering the context, the emotional impact on the sister, and the family's reaction, the author likely is in the wrong here. The prank wasn't harmless, especially given the underlying tensions and the setting.\n"
