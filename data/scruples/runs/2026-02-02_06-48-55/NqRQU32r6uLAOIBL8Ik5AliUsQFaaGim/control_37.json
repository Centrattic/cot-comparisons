She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who pranked their sister is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a complicated relationship with their sister, who was the favorite and they felt like an outcast. They decided to prank her by giving a fake Xbox at Christmas, leading to her emotional reaction and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a history of tension and past issues with their sister. Pranks can be a gray area, especially when there's already a strained relationship. The key points here are the intent, the nature of the prank, and the consequences.\n\nThe prank involved a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The sister was excited, then upset upon realizing it was a prank. She reacted emotionally, saying \"I hate you\" and that it ruined her Christmas. The family scolded the author, which suggests they found the prank inappropriate.\n\nI should think about whether the prank crossed a line. Pranks that cause emotional harm or take advantage of someone's feelings might be problematic. Since the author already has a complicated relationship, this prank could be seen as exploiting past hurt or adding to existing resentment. Also, pranking during a family event like Christmas, which is supposed to be a joyful time, might be more offensive. The sister's reaction indicates it hurt her feelings, and the family's disappointment suggests they felt it was not a good joke.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue it was a harmless prank meant to get back at their sister. But given the emotional response and the family's reaction, it seems like it went too far. The author's history of trying to get attention by pranking might also contribute to the family thinking it's not appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the prank likely caused more harm than intended, especially in a sensitive family setting. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the prank led to emotional distress and the family's disapproval, indicating it was not harmless.\n"
