She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author feels like they were an outcast and the sister was the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and the family's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the key factors here are the nature of the prank, the intent, the impact, and the context. The prank was meant to be humorous, but it resulted in the sister crying and feeling ruined Christmas. The family didn't find it funny and scolded the author. \n\nThe author's motivation is important. They mention wanting to get back at the sister for childhood issues. This could mean the prank was more about revenge than just a lighthearted joke. Pranks that target someone's emotions, especially when there's existing tension, can cross the line into cruelty.\n\nThe prank's execution: giving a fake expensive gift in front of the family. Even if it's a prank, expecting someone to be excited about a gift that turns out to be a fake might be too much. The sister's reaction was strong, indicating it hurt her feelings. The family's disappointment suggests they found it inappropriate.\n\nThe author's defense is that they think the family is just being overly protective of the sister. However, the sister's emotional response and the family's reaction imply that the prank was not considered harmless. The line between a prank and bullying can be thin, especially when there's a history of conflict.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, pranks are usually supposed to be consensual and not cause lasting harm. This prank caused immediate distress and ruined the sister's Christmas experience. The public nature of the prank in front of the family adds to the humiliation, which might not be seen as funny by others.\n\nSo, considering the context, intent, and consequences, the author likely crossed the line into being harmful rather than humorous. The sister's strong negative reaction and the family's disapproval support the idea that the author is in the wrong.\n"
