She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by pranking their sister in front of the family. The situation is complicated because of their history. The sister was the favorite, and the author felt like an outcast. They pranked her by giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions they don't like each other and have a history of conflict. Pranks can be harmless, but when there's a tense history, they can escalate things. The prank happened in front of the entire family, which might have been embarrassing for the sister. The sister's reaction was strong\u2014crying, running away, and saying the author ruined Christmas. The family's disappointment and scolding suggest they saw it as inappropriate.\n\nEven if the author intended it as a joke, the impact on the sister and the family matters. The prank might have crossed a line by causing emotional harm, especially with their existing issues. The author's history of trying to get attention through pranks might indicate a pattern of behavior that's hurtful. So, even if the prank wasn't meant to be malicious, the effect was negative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the prank caused harm and upset the family.\n"
