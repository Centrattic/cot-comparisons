She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The story is that the sister was the favorite, leading to the author feeling like an outcast. He's had a complicated relationship with her, even blaming her for ruining his childhood. For Christmas, he gave her a fake Xbox filled with a rock as a prank. The sister was upset, and the family scolded him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivations are rooted in feeling neglected and seeking revenge for feeling mistreated. But the prank itself involved deception and causing emotional harm. Pranks are usually meant to be light-hearted, but this seems more like a vindictive act. The sister was excited and then disappointed, leading to her emotional reaction. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank crossed a line, especially in front of others. Even if the author saw it as harmless, the impact on his sister and the family's reaction indicate it was hurtful. The key points are intent, the method of deception, and the emotional consequences. The author's history of conflict with his sister might contribute to the prank's severity. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because the prank was malicious and caused significant distress, not a harmless joke.\n"
