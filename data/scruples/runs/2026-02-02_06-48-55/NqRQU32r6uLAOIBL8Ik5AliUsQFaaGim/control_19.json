She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of family. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to their sister being upset and the family being disappointed.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has a complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like they were overshadowed and that the sister was spoiled. They have a history of conflict, so the prank might not be out of the blue. But even with that, pranks can cross lines, especially in family settings.\n\nThe prank was done in front of the whole family. Public humiliation can be hurtful, especially when it's a vulnerable moment like Christmas. The sister was excited, thinking it was a real gift, then disappointed and humiliated. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, indicating they felt it was inappropriate.\n\nThe author might argue it's just a prank, but the impact matters. The sister reacted strongly, crying and saying hate. Even if there's a history of conflict, the public nature and the emotional response suggest it went too far. The family's disapproval points to the prank being hurtful, not harmless. So, the author likely is in the wrong.\n"
