She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank on their sister during Christmas. The author explains their complicated relationship, feeling like they were an outcast, and their sister being the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivations are rooted in past feelings of neglect and resentment. But pranks can be tricky, especially when there's a history of conflict. The prank happened in front of the entire family, which might have escalated the situation. The sister was happy initially, then upset when the prank was revealed. The family reacted with disappointment, suggesting the prank was hurtful.\n\nThe key points to consider: was the prank harmless? Did it cross a line? Intentions matter, but the impact is also crucial. Even if the author intended a joke, causing someone to cry and say they hate you might be seen as going too far. The family's disapproval adds weight. Also, using a situation meant to be joyous (Christmas) for such a prank could be seen as inconsiderate. The sister's reaction indicates it wasn't harmless. The author's history of conflict might not justify the prank either. So, the author's actions likely caused intentional harm under the guise of a joke, which is probably wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
