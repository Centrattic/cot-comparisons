She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship, with the author feeling like they were the outcast and the sister being the favorite. The prank involved giving a fake Xbox with a rock inside, leading to the sister's emotional reaction and family disapproval.\n\nFirst, the author's intent is key. They mention they have a history of getting back at their sister because she \"ruined my life and stole my childhood.\" That sets up some context, but the prank itself involved deception and causing emotional harm. The sister's reaction was crying and feeling her Christmas was ruined, which shows the prank had a negative impact.\n\nEven though the author might see it as a harmless prank, the consequences matter. The sister was expecting an actual gift as an apology, which adds emotional weight. The family's reaction was disappointment and scolding, indicating they saw it as harmful. Pranks that humiliate or hurt someone, especially in front of others, are generally considered in poor taste. The fact that the author targeted their sister's hopes and then laughed about it in front of family members makes it more hurtful. Siblings with a strained relationship might not benefit from such pranks, and it's important to consider the recipient's feelings. So, the author's actions, while maybe intended as a joke, caused real pain and were inappropriate given the context.\n"
