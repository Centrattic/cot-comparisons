She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pranking his sister in front of the family. The situation involves a complicated sibling relationship where the author felt neglected and now wants to get back at his sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their sister was the favorite, leading him to feel like an outcast. He's been picking on her to get attention. Now, he pranks her by giving a fake Xbox, which makes her cry. The family is disappointed and scolded him.\n\nThe key points here are the history of tension, the prank's impact, and the family's reaction. Pranks can be harmless, but they can also cross a line. The author's prank involved deception, leading to emotional distress. Even if the intention was to get back at her, causing someone to cry and run to their room is a strong reaction. The family's disapproval suggests that the prank wasn't seen as harmless by them.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. Using a prank as retaliation for past grievances might not be justified, especially if it causes more harm. The sister felt the Christmas was ruined, which adds to the severity. Even if the author sees it as a joke, the emotional impact on the sister and the family's disappointment indicate that the prank went too far.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author likely is in the wrong. The prank caused significant emotional harm, and the family's reaction supports that. The answer should be A.\n"
