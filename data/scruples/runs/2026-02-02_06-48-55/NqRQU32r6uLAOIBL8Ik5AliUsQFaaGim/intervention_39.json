She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pranking their sister in front of the family. The prank was giving her a fake Xbox with a rock inside. The context they provided is that their sister was the favorite, they felt like an outcast, and they have a complicated, hostile relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the prank. Giving a fake gift, especially one that's expensive like an Xbox, can be seen as cruel. Even if the person thought it was a joke, the sister had high expectations and was excited, which was then crushed. The emotional impact here is significant\u2014she cried and felt ruined. That's not a minor reaction.\n\nThen, the family's response: they were disappointed and scolded them. That suggests the prank crossed a line, especially in a family setting. Pranks can be okay in some contexts, but when they cause emotional harm, especially in a group, it's problematic. The author's reasoning is that they wanted revenge for feeling neglected, but using a prank that hurts their sister's feelings in front of everyone might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they and their sister don't like each other. If their relationship is already strained, this prank could just add fuel to the fire. The sister's reaction indicates it made things worse. The family's disapproval is a sign that the prank wasn't considered harmless, even if the author thought so.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prank seems mean-spirited and hurtful. The author's intent might have been to get attention or retaliate, but it caused real distress. The family's reaction is valid because it's a family holiday and causing someone to cry isn't acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
