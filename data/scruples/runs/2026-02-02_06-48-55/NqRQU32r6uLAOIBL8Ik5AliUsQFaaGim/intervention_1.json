She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pranking their sister in front of the family. The author explains their complicated relationship with their sister, feeling like an outcast and that the sister was the favorite, leading to resentment. They pulled a prank by giving a fake Xbox One with a rock inside, which upset the sister and the family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author mentions a history of conflict, feeling neglected, and using pranks as a way to get attention. The prank in question was public, during a family event (Christmas), and the sister was emotionally affected. The family reacted negatively, scolding the author, but he's unsure if it's justified.\n\nNow, considering the prank itself. Hiding a rock in a fake Xbox case is a physical, potentially expensive item. Even if it's a prank, the sister was excited, opened it in front of everyone, and then felt deceived. The author's intention might have been to get back at her due to past grievances, but the method involved public humiliation and causing emotional distress during a family celebration.\n\nThe key points here are the public nature of the prank, the sister's emotional reaction (crying, running away), and the family's disapproval. The author's justification is rooted in their personal feelings of neglect, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. Pranks can be harmless, but they cross into harm when they cause emotional pain, especially in vulnerable moments like a family gathering. Also, the sister's reaction suggests the prank was hurtful, even if the author saw it as a joke.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. Typically, if a prank causes someone to feel humiliated or deeply upset, especially in a public setting, it's considered in poor taste and potentially hurtful. The family's reaction indicates they saw it as inappropriate, which aligns with societal norms where family events should be positive and inclusive, not used for personal vendettas.\n\nAdditionally, the author's history of resentment might contribute to the prank being more about seeking revenge than a light-hearted joke. The sister's emotional response (\"I hate you\") shows that the prank had a significant negative impact. Even if the prank wasn't meant to be malicious, the outcome was harmful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's prank was inconsiderate, public, and caused emotional harm. While there's context of a strained relationship, the action itself is still in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
