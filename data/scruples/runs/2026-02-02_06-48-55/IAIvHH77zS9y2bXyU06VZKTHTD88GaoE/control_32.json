Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the author has known Will since primary school, so they're close. But Will was raised in a racist environment and has shown racist behavior over time. The examples given are escalating from minor things like using racial slurs behind someone's back to aggressive confrontations with black people, even using a racial slur and swearing. The author tried to distance themselves before, but Will's mental health situation (depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, being their only friend) probably made them hesitate. \n\nThen the final incident in the group chat with a black person led the author to block Will and avoid him. The question is if this decision makes them the \"asshole\" or not. \n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. Will's behavior is harmful and offensive. The author is protecting their own values and maybe safety by distancing. On the other, Will has significant mental health struggles and the author is his only friend. But the author might have tried to address the issue before, and maybe this was the culmination of ongoing problems. \n\nIt's important to consider that the author tried to handle it before but couldn't reconcile Will's racism with their friendship. The final incident was a trigger. While cutting off someone isn't easy, especially when they're vulnerable, the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship. They might have tried to support Will in other ways, but if the racism is unaddressed and harmful, walking away could be the right choice. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because standing up against racism is justified, and they're also protecting their own well-being. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health issues, and Will needs to seek help for his own problems, not expect the author to enable harmful behavior.\n"
