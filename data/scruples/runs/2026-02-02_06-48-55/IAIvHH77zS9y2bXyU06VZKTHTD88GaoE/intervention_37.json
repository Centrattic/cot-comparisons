Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Will has a history of racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. That's pretty serious, especially when he was physically confrontational and used the n-word. The author tried to distance themselves before, but this recent incident pushed them to cut off completely. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The author might feel conflicted because they care about his mental health but can't condone his racism. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, supporting racism is harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. The author has every right to protect themselves and others from Will's behavior. However, cutting off completely without trying to help might be seen as abandoning him when he's vulnerable. But given that Will's actions are actively hurtful and the author has tried to distance before, maybe this is a necessary step for their own well-being and safety. \n\nAlso, mental health doesn't excuse harmful behavior. While Will's issues are severe, the author isn't responsible for his actions. They can't be expected to stay in a toxic friendship just because he's struggling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They're prioritizing their boundaries and the well-being of others, which is important. However, they might have been a bit abrupt in their actions without trying to address the issue first. But given the severity of Will's behavior, maybe the right choice was to cut off. \n\nHmm, but the user initially thought the author was wrong. Maybe they feel that the author should have tried to help more. But I think the key here is that Will's behavior is unacceptable regardless of his mental health. The author isn't responsible for fixing his issues. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
