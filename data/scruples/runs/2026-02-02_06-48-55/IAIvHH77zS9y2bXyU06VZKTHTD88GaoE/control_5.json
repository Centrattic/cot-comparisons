Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will was raised in a racist household and developed beliefs about racial superiority. As a child, the author didn't notice this, but during their teenage years, Will started using racial slurs and being aggressive towards minorities. At 16, he even told two black people in the park to leave using swear words and slurs, specifically mentioning that their faces made him angry. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is really depressed, anorexic, anxious, and the author is his only friend. After a recent incident in a group chat where Will attacked a black person for no reason, the author blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school, not speaking to him anymore. Now the author is questioning if they are in the wrong (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here: Will's racism, the author's friendship with Will, Will's mental health issues (depression, anorexia, self-harm), and the author's decision to cut him off. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for abandoning a friend with depression due to his racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. It's harmful and discriminatory, and it affects others negatively. The author has witnessed Will's behavior over the years, starting from minor slurs to more aggressive actions. The recent incident in the group chat was the final straw. The author is probably feeling that Will's racism is unacceptable and that they can't continue the friendship while enabling such harmful behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health challenges. The author is his only friend, so cutting him off might leave him even more isolated, which could worsen his depression. The author is struggling with the guilt of abandoning him when he's in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut the author's responsibility here isn't necessarily to be a savior. They can't be held responsible for Will's mental health issues when Will's actions are harmful. The author is justified in protecting themselves and others from Will's racism. While it's important to consider mental health, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that is toxic and perpetuates racism. Will's upbringing might have contributed to his beliefs, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. The author's decision to distance themselves is a form of self-respect and standing up against racism.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have tried to address the racism more directly before cutting off. But given the progression of Will's behavior and the recent incident, it's clear that he hasn't changed and is still harmful. So the author's final decision to block him is understandable. They might be in the right because they are prioritizing their ethics and the well-being of others over the guilt of losing a friend. Also, it's important to note that the author is not ignoring Will's mental health but is instead setting a boundary that they can't support Will's harmful actions. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
