Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has known Will since primary school, which is a long time. Will was raised in a racist household and became a racist adult. The racism started small, like using racial slurs behind people's backs, but escalated to aggressive behavior, including attacking minorities in public with swear words and slurs. The author mentions a specific incident where Will told two Black people to leave, using the n-word, and then justified it by saying their faces made him angry. That's pretty shocking and clearly harmful.\n\nThen there's the other side: Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The author feels conflicted because Will is their closest friend and is in a bad mental state. But after another incident in a group chat where Will targeted a Black person again, the author blocked him and stopped talking to him. They're wondering if they're in the wrong because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for cutting off a friend who's racist but also has mental health problems?\n\nI need to consider a few points here. First, the harm caused by Will's racism. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is protecting themselves and others from someone who spreads hate and aggression. Will's actions are not just offensive but actively harmful to others. The author is standing up against that, which is a valid choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels guilty because Will is struggling with mental health. But should that guilt override the need to protect themselves and others from Will's behavior? Also, is the author responsible for being Will's only source of support? That's a big burden. Maybe Will needs professional help, but the author isn't obligated to be his sole support system, especially when he's toxic.\n\nThe author's decision to distance themselves is a form of self-care and setting boundaries. They can't be responsible for someone else's mental health issues, especially when that person is actively harmful. It's possible that Will's mental health issues contributed to his racism, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The author is choosing their own well-being and safety, which is understandable.\n\nI should also think about whether the author gave Will a chance to change. The author mentions trying to distance before the final incident. However, after multiple instances, it's clear that Will hasn't changed. The author's final action was after another incident, so they've tried to give him chances but ultimately found it too much to handle.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility to help someone in need. But helping someone with mental health and racism isn't just about being a friend; it requires professional intervention. The author isn't a therapist and can't be expected to fix Will's issues alone. Cutting off is a way to take a step back when the friend is causing harm.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior. While Will's mental health is a factor, it doesn't justify his racism. The author's actions are a boundary to preserve their own mental health and safety. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
