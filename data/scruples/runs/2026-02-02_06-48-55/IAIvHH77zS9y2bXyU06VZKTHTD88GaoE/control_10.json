Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for abandoning their friend because he's a racist. The friend, Will, has a history of racism and mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The author is dealing with a friend who has racist behavior, which is harmful and unacceptable. On the other hand, the friend is also dealing with significant mental health issues. The author is conflicted between cutting ties to avoid enabling racism and feeling guilty about abandoning someone in need.\n\nThe key points to analyze are: 1) The severity of Will's racist actions, such as using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. 2) The author's responsibility to their friend's well-being versus their own. 3) Whether the author's action of blocking them was the right choice given the circumstances.\n\nRacism is a serious issue that can cause real harm. The author might feel justified in distancing themselves to protect others and themselves from Will's behavior. However, cutting off someone who is already struggling with mental health could leave them without support. But the author isn't necessarily responsible for fixing Will's mental health issues, especially if the friend is making harmful choices.\n\nThe author tried to distance themselves earlier but perhaps felt conflicted. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, leading to the decision to block. It's important to consider that the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and safety when dealing with someone's harmful behavior, even if that person is a friend with mental health issues.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. Here, the author's action seems justified because they're addressing a friend's harmful behavior, even if it's due to mental health struggles. The author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's toxic or harmful to others. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
