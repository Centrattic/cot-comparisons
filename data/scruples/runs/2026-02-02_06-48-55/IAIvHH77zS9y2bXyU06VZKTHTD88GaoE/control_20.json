Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend who is racist but also struggling with depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend, Will, has a history of racism, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before but now completely cut off contact after another incident. However, Will also has mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm, and the author is his only friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the friend's behavior is harmful and unacceptable. The author has a right to protect themselves from toxic behavior and not enable racism. On the other hand, the friend is in a vulnerable state, and cutting off completely might leave him without support.\n\nBut the author mentions that they tried to distance before but couldn't fully cut off. Now, after another incident, they decided to block him. The author is conflicted because of Will's mental health struggles. However, enabling harmful behavior isn't the solution. The author isn't obligated to stay friends with someone who is racist, especially if they're not getting through to him. It's possible to feel conflicted but still make the right choice by prioritizing their own well-being and not supporting harmful actions.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and protect themselves from someone who is being racist, even if that person has their own issues. It's important to not condone or support racism, regardless of personal circumstances.\n"
