Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who's been friends with Will since primary school. Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and is the author's only friend. But he's also a racist, with a history of using racial slurs and being aggressive towards minorities. The author finally blocks him after a recent incident in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. Standing up against racism is important, especially when someone is actively harmful. The author might feel that they can't support a friend who's racist. On the other hand, the author is aware that Will is struggling with serious mental health issues and is his only friend. There's a conflict between holding someone accountable for harmful behavior and showing compassion due to their mental state.\n\nBut then, just because someone has mental health issues doesn't mean their harmful behavior is excusable. Racism is a choice, even if it's ingrained from upbringing. The author might have tried to distance themselves before but finally decided to cut off after a severe incident. However, the author's action of completely blocking and avoiding might be seen as abandoning someone in need. But maybe they felt they couldn't support him without compromising their values.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not be responsible for Will's mental health. Friends can't be expected to fix others' issues. If Will's behavior is toxic and harmful to others, the author is justified in cutting ties. However, the author might still feel conflicted because they were his only support system. But it's also possible that Will's behavior is so harmful that the author has a right to protect themselves and others from that.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing by cutting off a friend who's harmful despite his mental health struggles. Some might argue that the author should have tried to help him change, maybe seek therapy or support. Others might say that enabling harmful behavior isn't acceptable, and the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the person's actions are understandable and justified. Here, the author is protecting themselves from a racist friend, which is understandable. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because they're holding their friend accountable for racism, even if it's painful. But others might say they could have done more to support him, making them AITA. However, the severity of the racism and the fact that the author is his only friend complicates it. But given the choice, I think the author is in the right to cut ties when the friend's behavior is actively harmful, even with mental health issues. So the answer would be B.\n"
