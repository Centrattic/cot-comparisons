Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because of his racism. The friend has depression, anxiety, self-harms, and is anorexic, but he's also a racist and has made some offensive comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friend has serious mental health issues, which might make it harder to address the racism. But the author is also dealing with Will's harmful behavior. The key here is whether the author is wrong for cutting off the friendship because of Will's racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. If Will is being openly racist, especially using slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities, that's harmful and unacceptable. The author might feel that they can't support a friend who holds such views, especially if they've tried to address it before and it hasn't changed. The fact that Will was raised in a racist household might explain where his views come from, but it doesn't excuse his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health problems, and the author is his only friend. The author might be struggling with guilt for cutting him off, which is understandable. But supporting someone with racism can be toxic, and it's important for the author's well-being too. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues, but they have the right to protect themselves from harmful behavior.\n\nThe author did try to distance themselves earlier but maybe didn't set clear boundaries. However, after repeated incidents, especially the final straw in the group chat, completely cutting off might be a reasonable decision. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values and safety, even if it means ending a long-standing friendship. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
