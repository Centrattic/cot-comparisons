Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will who has depression but is also a racist. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, Will has been friends with the author since primary school. He was raised in a racist household and has shown racist behavior over the years, escalating from using slurs behind people's backs to aggressive outbursts. The final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person without reason, leading the author to cut all contact. But Will also has serious mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing by cutting off Will. On one hand, Will's racist behavior is harmful and the author shouldn't have to tolerate that. It's important to not enable or support someone's harmful actions. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health, and the author feels guilty about leaving him isolated.\n\nBut the author has a right to their own well-being. They've tried to distance themselves before, but Will's behavior continued. The final incident was a clear breaking point. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they can't be forced to stay in a toxic friendship. However, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like setting boundaries or encouraging Will to seek help, but given the severity of the racism and the fact that it's ongoing, cutting contact might be justified. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own safety and values over a friendship that's harmful.\n"
