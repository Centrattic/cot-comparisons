Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their childhood friend, Will, who has depression and is a racist. The writer cut off Will after several incidents of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The writer was exposed to Will's racist behavior over the years, from minor slurs to aggressive outbursts. They tried to distance themselves but felt compelled to end the friendship after a final incident. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm, and the writer is his only friend.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's behavior versus the writer's moral responsibility. The writer might feel conflicted because they care about Will's well-being but can't condone racism. The question is whether cutting off a friend is justified when the friend has significant mental health issues.\n\nI should consider if the writer had other options, like trying to help Will seek treatment or setting boundaries. But given Will's aggression and the final incident in the group chat, the writer might have felt that staying in the friendship would enable the racism. Also, the writer's own need to protect themselves from harmful behavior is valid.\n\nMental health doesn't excuse harmful actions, but it's a factor in why Will behaves that way. However, the writer isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they can't force him to change. Ending a friendship is a personal choice, especially when one's own mental health is at stake. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their values and safety, even if it means losing a friend. The complexities of mental health are acknowledged, but that doesn't justify the racist behavior. The writer's decision to cut off contact after repeated harmful actions is understandable.\n"
