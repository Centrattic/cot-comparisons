Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's friend Will has been their close friend since primary school. He was raised in a racist environment and started showing racist behavior as they grew up. The examples include using racial slurs behind people's backs and even confronting two black people with aggression and slurs. Then, when they were 16, Will called someone the n-word and said their faces made him angry. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is their only friend.\n\nNow, the final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person again, leading the author to block him and avoid him. They\u2019re questioning if they're in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes or B for no.\n\nSo, the key points here are Will's racist behavior and his mental health. The author is dealing with conflicting feelings: cutting off a friend who's unkind vs. knowing he's struggling. But Will's actions are clearly harmful and racist. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but couldn't fully cut ties until the final incident. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and supporting someone's harmful behavior isn't right, even if they have mental health issues. The author is protecting themselves and others by ending the friendship. However, they might feel guilty because of Will's mental health. But the responsibility for his behavior lies with Will, not the author. The author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to set boundaries, especially when someone is being racist and harmful. Supporting someone's mental health doesn't mean condoning their racism. The author acted appropriately in protecting themselves and others.\n"
