Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has a history of racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before but now took a firm action after a recent incident. Will's mental health issues include depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and being their only friend.\n\nThe question is whether cutting off a toxic friend is wrong, especially when that friend has mental health struggles. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who harms others is problematic. On the other hand, the author was a support system for Will, and cutting off might exacerbate his mental health issues.\n\nI should think about the responsibility towards others affected by Will's racism versus the responsibility towards him. The author might be protecting themselves and others from harmful behavior, but abandoning a friend in crisis could lead to more harm. However, enabling harmful behavior isn't the solution either.\n\nThe line between standing up against racism and abandoning someone in need is thin. The author might be doing the right thing by removing themselves from a toxic situation, but they might also feel guilt for not continuing support. It's a tough balance between accountability and compassion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might stem from valid concerns about Will's harmful behavior, completely cutting off without some form of support (like encouraging professional help) could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. However, given the circumstances, it's a complex situation where both perspectives have merit.\n"
