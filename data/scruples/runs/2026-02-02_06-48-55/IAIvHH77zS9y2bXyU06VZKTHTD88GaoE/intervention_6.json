Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist. The friend has depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, self-harms, and the writer feels conflicted about cutting him off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will's racism includes using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making hurtful remarks. The writer tried to distance themselves before but finally blocked him after a recent incident. However, Will also has significant mental health issues and the writer is his only friend.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. The writer has a right to protect themselves from harmful behavior. Standing up against racism is important, and Will's actions are clearly offensive and hurtful. The writer might be prioritizing their own well-being and values here.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is concerned about Will's mental health. Will has multiple issues, and the writer is his only friend. Cutting off might leave him without support. The writer might feel guilty for abandoning him, even though his behavior is unacceptable.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing their right to distance from harmful behavior versus the responsibility to support a friend in need. However, it's important to note that while the writer might not be wrong for cutting off, they could still have a responsibility to encourage Will to seek help, perhaps through other means if direct support isn't possible. But in the scenario, it's stated that the writer blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school. That seems like a complete cut-off without any effort to connect him to resources. Maybe the right approach would be to set boundaries while encouraging professional help, but the writer hasn't done that here.\n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes, in the wrong), it would be because they didn't support their friend despite his issues. If it's B (not in the wrong), it's because they can't be expected to tolerate racism. I need to decide which is more valid.\n\nRacism is a choice, even if rooted in upbringing. The writer is not responsible for Will's behavior. Protecting oneself from racism is justified. However, cutting off completely without any effort to help might be seen as neglecting a friend in need. But the writer might not have the capacity to support him anymore given the toxicity. Alternatively, they could have tried to encourage therapy or other interventions before cutting off. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The writer might have felt that continued association would compromise their values and well-being. So, in that case, they are not in the wrong for distancing themselves from harmful behavior, even if it means losing a friend. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But perhaps there's a middle ground. However, given the options are A or B, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n"
