Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist and has depression. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author has known Will since primary school, so it's a long-term friendship. Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is the author's only friend. But he's also a racist, with examples given from teenagers to 16 years old. The racist behavior escalated, including using racial slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. The final straw was a recent incident in a group chat where he targeted a black person without reason, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for ending this friendship. On one hand, Will has serious mental health issues and is vulnerable, which might make it hard to walk away. On the other hand, the author is being subjected to Will's racist behavior, which is harmful and offensive. The author's decision to distance themselves could be seen as self-respect and protecting their values, but they feel guilty because of Will's depression.\n\nI should consider the ethics of the situation. Racism is a serious issue, and enabling racist behavior, especially when someone is in a toxic or harmful mindset, can be problematic. The author tried to be a friend but eventually decided to end the relationship due to Will's harmful actions. Mental health is important, but it doesn't excuse racism. The author's actions might be justified if they tried to help and it didn't work. However, the sudden blocking without communication might appear harsh, but given the severity of the incidents, like using the n-word and targeting others, it's understandable.\n\nAlso, the fact that Will's racist views are harmful and the author is standing up against them by cutting ties could be seen as a moral choice. However, the author might have considered if there's a way to support Will's mental health while addressing his racism. But since the examples show Will's aggression and the last incident was unprovoked, it's possible the author couldn't continue the friendship without compromising their own values and potentially causing more harm to others.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the author has a right to distance themselves from toxic and harmful behavior, even if the person is struggling with mental health, the answer would be B (No). But I need to make sure that the author's actions are not neglecting responsibility. However, in cases where a friend is both in need and harmful, the line is blurred. The key here is that the author tried to be there for Will but finally had enough after seeing that his behavior was unacceptable. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
