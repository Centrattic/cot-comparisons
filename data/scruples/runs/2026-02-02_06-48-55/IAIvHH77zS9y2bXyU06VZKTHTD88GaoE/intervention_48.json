Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Will has been a close friend since primary school, but he's a racist, which the author started noticing more as they grew older. There are specific examples of Will's racist behavior, like using racial slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before, but this time they completely cut off Will after a recent incident in a group chat. \n\nNow, on one hand, racism is a serious issue. It's not okay to tolerate hatred or harmful behavior towards others based on their race. The author might feel that they can't support Will's racist actions, especially since it's harmful and offensive. They might believe that standing up against racism is necessary, even if it means losing a friend.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles: depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The author is his only friend, which adds a layer of complexity. The author might be struggling with the decision because they care about Will's well-being but can't condone his harmful behavior. It's possible they feel conflicted about cutting him off, as it might not help Will's mental health.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's responsibility. While mental health is important, it doesn't justify racist behavior. However, the author might be criticized for not trying to help Will address his racism and mental health issues together, rather than cutting him off entirely. But given the examples provided, Will's actions are clearly hurtful and the author might feel they can't continue the friendship while Will remains racist.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had previous attempts to address the issue. The story mentions the author wanted to distance themselves before but didn't act. Now, they took action after a final incident. Maybe they thought they gave Will chances, and this was the last straw. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a tough call. The author isn't responsible for Will's actions, but they do have a choice in how they respond. By cutting off contact, the author might be protecting others from Will's behavior and also setting boundaries for themselves. However, completely abandoning someone in such a vulnerable state could be seen as harsh, especially if Will is already struggling. \n\nBut considering the repeated harmful actions and the author's own well-being, it's possible the author made a difficult but necessary decision. They might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their values against racism, even if it means the friendship ends. Mental health is crucial, but it shouldn't be an excuse for bigotry. The author isn't obligated to remain friends with someone who is actively harmful, regardless of their personal struggles.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a choice to stop enabling or supporting harmful behavior, which is a valid stance. However, the author might be encouraged to seek a middle ground, like encouraging Will to get help for both his racism and mental health, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The examples given show that the author tried to distance before but now took a firm stand after multiple incidents. So, the answer is B.\n"
