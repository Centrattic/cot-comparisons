Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism and offensive behavior, despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The writer had a close friend since childhood, Will, who was raised in a racist environment. As they grew older, Will's racism became more apparent and aggressive, including using racial slurs and targeting minorities. The writer felt uncomfortable but stayed friends because Will had depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and was their only friend. However, after a recent incident in a group chat, the writer blocked Will and avoids him. Now, they're questioning if they're at fault for ending the friendship.\n\nThe main question is whether distancing oneself from someone with harmful behavior is justified, even if that person is dealing with mental health issues. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that affects others and the writer has a right to protect themselves and others from Will's behavior. Mental health struggles don't excuse harmful actions. On the other hand, Will's mental health is dire, and the writer might feel conflicted about cutting ties, especially since they were his only support system.\n\nBut the key here is that the writer is not being asked to enable Will's harmful behavior. Ending a toxic relationship where someone is causing harm is a valid choice. The writer's mental health and safety are also important. They can't be expected to stay in a friendship that's negative and harmful, even if the friend is struggling. Additionally, it's possible that Will might need professional help rather than relying on the writer to manage his issues.\n\nI should also consider the perspective that the writer might have tried to support Will given his mental health but reached a breaking point. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, which is understandable. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set boundaries and protect others from Will's racism, even if he has mental health challenges. The writer isn't responsible for Will's actions, and prioritizing their own well-being and that of others is justified.\n"
