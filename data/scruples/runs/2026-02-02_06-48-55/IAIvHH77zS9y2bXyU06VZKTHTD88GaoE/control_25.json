Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user's best friend, Will, has depression and several mental health issues, including anorexia, anxiety, and self-harming. But he's also a racist, with a history of using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off Will after a recent incident in a group chat where Will targeted someone black.\n\nFirst, I should consider the severity of Will's actions. Racism is a serious issue, and the examples given\u2014like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior\u2014show that Will has a pattern of harmful behavior. The user mentions that Will was brought up in a racist household, which might explain some of his behavior, but that doesn't excuse it. People are responsible for their actions, regardless of upbringing.\n\nThen there's the mental health aspect. Will is struggling with depression and other issues, and the user is his only friend. The user might feel conflicted because they care about Will but can't tolerate his racism. The key question here is whether the user is justified in distancing themselves from Will given the harmful behavior. \n\nOn one hand, supporting someone with mental health issues is important, but that doesn't mean one has to tolerate bigotry. On the other hand, cutting off someone who is already isolated could exacerbate their mental health problems. However, the user might feel that their own well-being is at stake if they continue to associate with someone who spreads hate. \n\nThe user did try to distance themselves gradually, as mentioned in the escalation from subtle racism to more aggressive acts. The final incident in the group chat seems to be the breaking point. It's possible that the user is trying to protect not only themselves but also others in the group chat from Will's harmful behavior. \n\nBut the user is also concerned about Will's mental health. However, Will's actions are a choice that affects others negatively. Mental health does not excuse bigotry. The user has a right to set boundaries to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user is not in the wrong for cutting off Will. They're standing up against racism, which is a moral stance, even if it's difficult given their past friendship. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
