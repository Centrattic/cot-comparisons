Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and is a racist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will was raised in a racist environment and exhibits racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves but continued the friendship because Will was struggling with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. However, after a particularly offensive incident in a group chat, the author cut off contact entirely.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. The user initially thought the author was wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nOn one hand, Will's behavior is clearly harmful and unacceptable. Racism is a serious issue, and the author has a right to distance themselves from it. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues, and the author was his only support system. The author might feel conflicted about cutting off someone in need, but enabling harmful behavior isn't the solution either.\n\nThe author tried to handle it by distancing before finally cutting off after repeated incidents. This could be seen as a necessary step to protect their own well-being and stand against racism. However, completely cutting off someone with severe mental health issues might have negative consequences for Will. But the author isn't responsible for Will's actions; they did their best and have the right to set boundaries against racism. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on repeated harmful behavior despite mental health struggles. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
