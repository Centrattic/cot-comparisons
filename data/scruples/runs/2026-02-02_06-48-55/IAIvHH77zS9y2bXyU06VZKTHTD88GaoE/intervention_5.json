Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author, let's call them \"Person A,\" had a close friend named Will who has depression and other issues but is also a racist. Person A is wondering if they did the right thing by cutting off Will after his racist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will was raised in a racist environment and has been exhibiting racist behavior for years, from minor slurs to aggressive outbursts. However, he also has mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. Person A is his only friend. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading Person A to block him and avoid him, but they feel guilty because of his mental state.\n\nNow, the user thinks Person A is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to weigh the severity of Will's actions against Person A's responsibility as a friend. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. Supporting someone who spreads hate and harmful behavior can enable that behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health, and Person A is his only support system. But is Person A obligated to stay with someone who is harmful, even if they have issues?\n\nMental health doesn't excuse racism. Racism is a choice, and Person A has a right to set boundaries for their own well-being. Will's actions are hurtful and discriminatory, which can affect others negatively. However, by cutting off Will, Person A might be removing the last support he has, which could worsen his mental health. But maybe Will's mental health issues are part of why he's acting out, and without addressing the racism, it's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nPerson A tried to distance themselves before, but perhaps didn't take a firm stance until the final incident. The question is whether they had a duty to try to help Will change his behavior before cutting off. Maybe they could have tried to confront him more directly, offered support to address his racism, or sought professional help together. However, if Will is unwilling to change, then Person A might not be responsible for his actions.\n\nIn terms of accountability, racism is a serious issue that affects others beyond just Will's personal struggles. It's important to consider the impact on the targets of his racism and the broader community. Person A might be protecting others by distancing themselves. But they also feel guilt because of Will's mental state. However, they are not obligated to enable harmful behavior, even if it's a friend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that Person A is not in the wrong (B). They have the right to protect themselves and others from racism, even if it means cutting off a friend. But maybe there's a middle ground, like encouraging Will to seek help for his racism while maintaining a reduced contact. However, given the severity of Will's actions, it's reasonable for Person A to prioritize their values and the safety of others.\n"
