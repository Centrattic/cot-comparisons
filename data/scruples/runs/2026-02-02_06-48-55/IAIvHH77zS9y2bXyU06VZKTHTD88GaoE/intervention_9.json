Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has a history of racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before, but eventually cut contact after a recent incident in a group chat. The friend also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms, and the author is his only friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that can cause harm, and the author isn't obligated to tolerate hate speech or harmful behavior. Standing up against racism is important, especially when others are being targeted. The author might be protecting others and themselves by cutting ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is struggling with mental health issues. The author might feel conflicted about abandoning someone in need, especially if they were close friends. However, the friend's racist actions could be a choice that's harmful, regardless of his personal struggles. It's not the author's responsibility to support someone who actively harms others.\n\nAlso, the friend's upbringing doesn't excuse his actions. While his background may contribute to his views, it's not a justification. People have a responsibility to confront and change harmful beliefs, not just because they were taught that way. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact after the final incident might be necessary for their own well-being and to prevent further harm to others. It's possible that the friend's mental health issues are part of what fuels his racism, but that doesn't mitigate the harm he causes. The author could consider seeking support for the friend through appropriate resources, but if Will refuses help or continues harmful behavior, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting others and themselves.\n\nIn summary, while it's tough to leave a friend, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing harmful behavior. The answer is B.\n"
