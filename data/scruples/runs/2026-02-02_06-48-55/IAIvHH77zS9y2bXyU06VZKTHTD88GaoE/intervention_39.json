Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend named Will who's a racist and has mental health issues. The author is distancing themselves from Will because of his racism but feels guilty since Will is depressed and has other problems like anorexia and self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. The key points here are the friend's racist behavior versus the author's decision to cut off contact. The author mentions that Will was taught racism at home and that his behavior became more aggressive over time, even using racial slurs and targeting minorities. The final straw was an incident in a group chat where Will attacked a black person. The author then blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school, but feels conflicted because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is right to distance themselves from someone who spreads hate. However, the author is also aware of Will's depression and other mental health struggles. The question is whether cutting off a close friend is justified here. The author might be doing the right thing by not supporting harmful behavior, but maybe could have tried to address the issue first, like confronting Will about his racism or seeking help for him instead of abruptly cutting ties. But given the severity of the actions described, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior, it's understandable that the author felt it was necessary to distance themselves for their own peace of mind and to not support such behavior. \n\nMental health is important, but it doesn't excuse racism. The author is not responsible for treating Will's mental health issues, especially if Will hasn't taken steps to address his racism. The author's action is a personal choice to protect themselves from being associated with someone who spreads hate, which is a valid decision. However, the author might feel they could have done more, but given the circumstances, cutting off contact isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a difficult choice to distance from a toxic friend, even though they feel guilty. The key here is that supporting racism is harmful, and the author is not obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic or harmful. Their mental health and values are also important, so cutting ties is a reasonable response.\n"
