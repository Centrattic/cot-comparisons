Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, the author has known Will since primary school and was close. Will's racism starts small but escalates, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. A specific incident in the park where Will uses a racial slur and aggressive language towards two black people is mentioned. The author then distanced themselves, but Will has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend.\n\nThe key points are: the author is cutting off someone with serious mental health problems due to racist behavior. The question is whether that makes them at fault (AITA). \n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author is justified in distancing themselves from someone who engages in harmful and offensive behavior. Will's actions are not just personal; they're about targeting others based on race, which is a major red flag. The author might feel they are protecting themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health challenges. The author might feel conflicted because they were a close friend and are his only support system. However, staying in a friendship with someone who expresses racism could enable harmful behavior and might not be healthy for the author either. The author's decision to cut off contact might be for their own well-being and to not perpetuate Will's harmful behavior.\n\nBut is there a responsibility to try to help someone with mental health issues instead of cutting them off? Maybe the author could have tried to address Will's racism through education or encouraging professional help, but given the severity and persistence of Will's actions, it might have been too late for that. The author might not be equipped to handle such a complex situation, especially if Will is resistant to change.\n\nAlso, the author's own mental health and safety are important. Being around someone who expresses racism and aggression could be harmful. It's a tough situation, but the author's actions could be seen as self-preservation and standing up against racism.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to protect themselves and not tolerate harmful behavior, even if the person has their own struggles. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
