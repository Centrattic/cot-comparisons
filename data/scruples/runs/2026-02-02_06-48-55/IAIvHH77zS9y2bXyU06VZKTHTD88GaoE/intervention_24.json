Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: Will has been a close friend since childhood. He's been taught racism by his family, and over time, his behavior escalated from minor slurs to open aggression. There's a specific incident where he used racial slurs and aggression towards black people. Additionally, Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend.\n\nThe author blocked him and avoids him now. The question is whether they're at fault. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to hear my opinion.\n\nI need to balance two things: the severity of Will's racist behavior and the author's responsibility towards a friend with mental health issues. On one hand, racism is a serious issue and can cause harm. The author might feel justified in distancing themselves to protect their own well-being and to not support harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health problems and might need support.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author mentions that Will was their only friend and had significant mental health issues. However, the author didn't try to help him change his behavior\u2014like confronting him, seeking professional help, or supporting him while setting boundaries. Instead, they cut off completely, which might leave Will without support, potentially worsening his mental health.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In ethical terms, while it's important to support friends, one isn't obligated to enable harmful behavior. However, the abrupt cutoff without any support might be problematic. The author could have tried to help Will change his behavior while addressing their own mental health.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. If the author feels they can't handle the friend's toxic behavior anymore, it's understandable to step back. However, given the friend's vulnerable state, maybe there's a middle ground, like encouraging therapy or involving others to support him. But the author didn't do that, so maybe they're justified in removing themselves to protect their own well-being.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, everyone has the right to distance themselves from harmful behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and standing against racism. The answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, it's important to consider if there's a way to support without enabling, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author's action is a personal choice and not unethical.\n"
