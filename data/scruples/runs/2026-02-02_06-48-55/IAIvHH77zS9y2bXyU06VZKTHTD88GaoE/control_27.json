Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will who's a racist but also has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author was friends with Will since primary school, so they had a long relationship. Will's racism started showing up in the teenage years, starting with minor slurs and escalating to aggressive behavior towards minorities. The final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted someone again, leading the author to block him.\n\nWill has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and he's the author's only friend. The author is conflicted because they want to distance from Will's racism but feel guilty about leaving him in a vulnerable state.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author has the right to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. Will's actions are not just offensive but also threatening, especially using racial slurs and aggression. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as self-preservation and standing against racism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about Will's mental health. But it's important to note that Will's racism is part of his harmful behavior, and supporting someone with mental health issues doesn't mean enabling or tolerating hate speech. The author isn't responsible for Will's well-being; they can't be expected to fix his issues or stay friends with him if he's harmful.\n\nIt's a tough situation. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own safety and values. They tried to be a friend but couldn't condone Will's actions. Cutting off someone who is a threat to others and to the relationship is understandable. The guilt might be valid, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's detrimental to their own mental health and others'.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made a difficult but reasonable choice given Will's behavior.\n"
