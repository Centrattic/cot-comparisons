Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their best friend, Will, has depression and other mental health issues but is also a racist. The author has a history with Will from primary school, and over time, Will's racism has escalated from minor slurs to aggressive behavior targeting minorities. The final incident was in a group chat where Will attacked a black person, leading the author to cut off all contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is dealing with a close friend who has significant mental health challenges but also harmful behavior. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that affects others and can cause real harm. The author's decision to distance themselves might be seen as necessary to protect their own values and to not support harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with depression and other issues, and the author might feel a moral obligation to support him, especially since he's their only friend.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the severity of Will's racism and its impact on others, 2) the author's responsibility to support a friend with mental health issues, and 3) whether cutting off contact is an appropriate response. \n\nRacism is not just a personal issue; it affects the community and can cause lasting harm. The author might be standing up for their own values by leaving the friendship. However, completely cutting off someone in crisis could leave them without support, potentially worsening their mental health. But the author is also within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and to not enable harmful behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role in the friendship. If Will's racism is part of his identity and behavior, continuing the friendship could be complicit in that behavior. The author isn't responsible for Will's choices, but they have a right to set boundaries. The decision to block and avoid might be necessary for the author's mental health, even if it's hard.\n\nHowever, the author could have tried to address the issue earlier, perhaps seeking help or trying to support Will in a way that addresses his racism. But given the escalation over time and the final incident, maybe the author felt it was the only option left.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is not in the wrong for choosing to end a toxic relationship where the friend's actions are harmful. They can't be held responsible for Will's depression if they've already tried to help and the behavior continues. The author's actions are about self-respect and stopping complicity in racism.\n"
