Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for cutting off their oldest friend, Will, who is a racist but also has depression and other mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friend, Will, is a racist. His racism started when he was young, and over time, it escalated from subtle slurs to aggressive behavior, like using racial slurs and telling people to leave because of their race. The author was friends with him since childhood, but Will's behavior became more harmful as they got older. \n\nHowever, Will also has significant mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The author feels conflicted because they are his only friend, and they're worried about cutting him off. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for ending the friendship? On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author has the right to protect themselves from toxic behavior. Will's actions are hurtful and harmful, and the author might feel that they can't support a friend who expresses such hate. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health, and the author might feel guilty for abandoning him, especially since he's their only friend.\n\nBut here's the thing: while mental health is important, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. People can seek help for mental health issues, but racism is a choice, even if it's rooted in upbringing. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they're not a therapist. The author also has the right to set boundaries. Ending the friendship because of Will's actions is a personal choice, and the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing up against racism. \n\nHowever, the author might want to consider if there's a way to express their concerns to Will, maybe encouraging him to seek help, but they're not obligated to do so. The final decision to cut off the friendship is their own, and they're not wrong for it.\n"
