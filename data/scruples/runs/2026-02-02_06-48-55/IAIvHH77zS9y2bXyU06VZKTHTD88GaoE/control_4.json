Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for abandoning their friend who has depression because he's a racist. So the scenario is that the author, let's call them Person A, has been friends with Will since primary school. Will has a history of racism, which started with small things like using racial slurs behind people's backs and escalated to more aggressive behavior, like confronting black people in a park with swear words and slurs. Will also has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend. The final straw was when Will attacked a black person in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him at school. Now, the author is questioning if they're in the wrong for cutting off a friend, even though the friend is harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the friend's harmful behavior (racism, aggression) versus his mental health struggles. The author had a history of trying to distance themselves but couldn't because Will was isolated and dependent on them. The final incident was a clear act of racism and aggression. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, supporting someone's harmful behavior is generally not acceptable, especially when it's directed at others. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing up against racism. However, the situation is complicated by Will's mental health issues. The author might feel guilty for cutting off a friend in need, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and enabling someone's racist behavior can be harmful. The author might have tried to help Will in the past but reached a point where they can't continue supporting someone who perpetuates hate. It's important to consider if there were other options, like seeking professional help for Will, but the author might not have the resources or influence to do that. \n\nOn the other hand, abandoning someone who is struggling could be seen as neglectful, but in this case, the author is protecting themselves and others from harm. The key is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to Will's persistent and harmful behavior. Since Will's actions are directed at others and are part of a long-standing pattern, the author's decision to distance themselves is justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful actions, even though they feel conflicted about his mental health issues.\n"
