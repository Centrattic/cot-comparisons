Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will who has depression but is also a racist. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user has known Will since primary school and they were close. Over time, Will's racist behavior escalated from small slurs to aggressive incidents. The user tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is depressed, anorexic, and self-harms, with the user being his only friend. The final incident in a group chat led the user to block Will and avoid him, hence the question if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe main points to consider here are the ethical implications of cutting off a friend who has mental health issues despite their harmful behavior. On one hand, Will's racism is clearly harmful and unacceptable. Racism causes real harm to others, and the user is right to be disturbed by his actions, especially when it involves aggression and slurs. The user's decision to distance themselves could be seen as standing up against racism, which is a moral stance.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is struggling with depression, an eating disorder, and self-harm. The user feels guilty because they were his only support system. This raises questions about responsibility and the balance between personal boundaries and supporting someone in need. However, it's important to note that while mental health is a significant factor, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior like racism. People can and should seek help for their mental health without perpetuating discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the user's actions on Will. By cutting off contact completely, they remove a potential support system. But if the friendship was enabling Will's behavior or the user couldn't handle the emotional toll anymore, it might be necessary for their own well-being. The user might need to consider alternative ways to support Will without condoning his racism, like encouraging him to seek professional help or involving others who can provide support.\n\nHowever, the user's actions are a personal decision. They aren't obligated to maintain a friendship that is harmful to them or others. The final incident seems to be the culmination of ongoing issues, so the user's choice to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The key here is that while the user's guilt is understandable, they aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their own values and the well-being of others over maintaining a toxic friendship.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
