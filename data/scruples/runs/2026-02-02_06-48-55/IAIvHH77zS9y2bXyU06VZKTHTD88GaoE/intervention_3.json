Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The friend's behavior described here is pretty egregious: using racial slurs, aggressive actions towards minorities, and making offensive remarks. The author tried to distance themselves before completely cutting off contact, which makes sense given the severity of Will's actions.\n\nBut then there's the mental health aspect. Will is dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is isolated. The author is his only friend. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nCutting off someone who's vulnerable can be harmful. However, the author might be protecting themselves from toxic behavior. The final straw was a public racial attack in a group chat, which could be a legitimate reason to end the friendship. But the author's guilt about Will's mental state is also valid. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they might have done the right thing by setting boundaries against racism. But maybe there's a middle ground, like trying to have a serious conversation or encouraging Will to seek help. However, given Will's past behavior, it's possible the author felt it was too risky to continue the friendship. \n\nI think the key here is that prioritizing one's own well-being and safety isn't wrong, especially when dealing with someone whose harmful behavior doesn't show signs of changing. While it's sad for Will's mental health, the author isn't responsible for his issues. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to be careful because sometimes people think cutting off without trying to help is wrong, but in this case, the racism is a major red flag. The author's decision to leave could be the right choice for self-respect and safety.\n"
