Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression but is also a racist.\n\nFirst, the friend Will has a history of racism, from small slurs to aggressive outbursts. The author tried to distance themselves but eventually cut off contact after a final incident in a group chat. However, Will also has mental health issues like anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and depression. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about not supporting him despite his behavior.\n\nNow, considering the principles of right and wrong here. Will's racism is a serious issue that affects others, especially minorities. The author's decision to leave might be justified to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. But there's also the aspect of Will's mental health. The author was his only friend, so cutting off might have left him without support. \n\nBut wait, should the author be responsible for supporting someone who harms others? Even if Will is struggling, his actions are hurtful and the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic relationship. The author's mental health and safety matter too. Will needs professional help, not just the author's support. The author isn't the one causing the racism; they're the one trying to protect others.\n\nHowever, the author might feel guilty for not helping. But in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing up against racism. It's important to set boundaries, especially when someone's behavior is harmful. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they took a stand against racism and it's reasonable to distance oneself from someone who is actively harmful, even if they have mental health issues.\n"
