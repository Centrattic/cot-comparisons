Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and is the author's only friend. However, Will is also a racist, engaging in hurtful behavior, using racial slurs, and targeting minorities. The author cut off contact after a final incident.\n\nNow, the ethical part. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author is not responsible for Will's upbringing or his mental health issues, but they have a right to set boundaries. Supporting a friend who is harmful to others can enable that behavior. The author might feel conflicted because they care about Will's well-being but can't condone his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles. The author might feel guilty for cutting ties, especially since Will relies on them. But enabling harmful behavior isn't helpful. The author is making a choice to protect themselves and not be complicit in Will's racism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're distancing themselves from someone who is actively engaging in racism. It's a personal choice, and while it's tough given Will's mental state, it's not unethical. They're not obligated to stay in a friendship that's harmful. So the answer is B, No.\n"
