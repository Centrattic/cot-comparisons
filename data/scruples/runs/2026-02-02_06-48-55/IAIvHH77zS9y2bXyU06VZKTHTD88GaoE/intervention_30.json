Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will who is racist but also has depression and mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend, Will, has a history of racist behavior, which is definitely harmful and offensive. The author tried to distance themselves when the racism became more aggressive. Then, the final straw was when Will targeted someone in a group chat. The author blocked him and avoids him now.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health challenges: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about abandoning him despite his racism.\n\nSo, the question is whether cutting off a friend over racist behavior is wrong. Racist actions are hurtful and can't be justified. The author's decision to distance themselves is about protecting others from Will's harmful actions and also their own mental well-being. However, the author is worried about Will's mental health, which shows empathy. But it's not their responsibility to be the only support system for someone who harms others. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to prioritize safety and well-being of others. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship, especially since they tried to distance before. They can't be forced to remain friends with someone who behaves that way. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about right or wrong, not what they should do next. So, the decision to leave is justified given the circumstances.\n"
