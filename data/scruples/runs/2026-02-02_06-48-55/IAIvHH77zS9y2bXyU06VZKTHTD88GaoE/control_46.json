Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is at fault for cutting off their best friend who has depression and racism issues. So, the friend, Will, has a history of racism, including using slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is depressed and isolated. Then, after another incident in a group chat, the author blocked him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is dealing with a friend who has significant mental health issues but also harmful behavior. The key points are the severity of Will's racism and the author's actions. \n\nWill's racism is pretty clear. He uses racial slurs and targets minorities, which is a serious issue. The author has tried to distance themselves before, but now after another incident, they've cut off contact. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so despite Will's depression.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting themselves and others from harmful behavior. Racism is a choice that affects others negatively, and the author has a right to set boundaries. On the other hand, Will is struggling with depression and lacks support, which might make the author feel guilty for abandoning him.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's action is to cut off someone who is being racist and harmful, which is a valid reason. While they feel conflicted about Will's mental health, the author isn't responsible for his well-being if he's making harmful choices. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own safety and standing against racism.\n"
