Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Will have been friends since primary school. Will's racism starts small, like using racial slurs behind others' backs, but escalates to aggressive behavior. At 16, he confronts two Black people in a park, uses a racial slur, and tells them to leave. The author is shocked and wants to distance themselves. Now, after another incident in a group chat, the author blocks Will and avoids him at school. They\u2019re conflicted because Will is also struggling with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that can't be ignored. The author is protecting themselves and others from harmful behavior. Cutting off a toxic friendship is a valid choice. On the other hand, Will has mental health challenges, and the author might feel guilty for leaving him when he's vulnerable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are that the author is standing up against racism, which is right. Will's behavior is harmful and needs to be addressed. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's mental health; they can't be expected to stay in a toxic relationship that harms others. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the well-being of others by distancing themselves. While it's understandable to feel conflicted, the action taken isn't wrong. The author isn't obligated to enable harmful behavior, even if the person has mental health issues. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
