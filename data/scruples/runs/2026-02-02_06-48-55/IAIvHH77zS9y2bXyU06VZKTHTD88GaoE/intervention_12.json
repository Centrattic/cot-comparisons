Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author has known Will since primary school, so it's a long-term friendship. Will's racist behavior escalated over time, from minor slurs to aggressive outbursts. The example given where he called someone the n-word and used racial slurs is pretty severe. The author tried to distance themselves before, but Will's depression and other mental health issues made it hard to leave.\n\nNow, the author blocked Will and avoids him now. They feel conflicted because of Will's mental health struggles. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author is protecting themselves and others from harm. They can't be expected to tolerate or enable harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues, and cutting off completely might leave him without support. But the author is not obligated to be his only friend or support system, especially if Will's behavior is toxic.\n\nI think the key here is that the author made a choice to protect their own well-being and others, which is valid. They didn't engage in conflict but chose to remove themselves from a harmful situation. Even though Will needs help, the author isn't responsible for his actions or his mental health. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
