Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for cutting off his friend Will, who has depression and is a racist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, let's call him Alex, has known Will since primary school. They were close friends. Will was raised in a racist household and grew up with racist beliefs. As they got older, Will's racism became more overt\u2014using slurs, aggressiveness towards minorities, even an incident where he confronted two Black people with racial slurs and swore at them. This behavior escalated to the point where Alex had enough when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading Alex to cut off contact. However, Will also has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is socially isolated with Alex as his only friend.\n\nThe key points here are the harmful behavior from Will and Alex's decision to distance himself. On one hand, Will's racism is clearly problematic and harmful. Racism is a serious issue that affects others' well-being, and supporting or being around someone who spreads hate can enable that behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health issues and has no other friends. Alex feels conflicted because he cares about Will's well-being but can't tolerate his racism anymore.\n\nNow, considering whether Alex is in the wrong. In many cases, people have the right to set boundaries, especially when someone's behavior is hurtful and toxic. Will's actions are not just offensive but actively harmful. By continuing to associate with Will, Alex might inadvertently be supporting his racist views or enabling his harmful behavior. However, Alex is also concerned about Will's mental health, which complicates things. But mental health struggles don't excuse racism; they might explain part of it but not justify it.\n\nSome might argue that Alex should have tried to help Will instead of cutting him off. But given that Will's racism is so ingrained and that he's in denial (as shown by his justification about the Black people's faces), it's possible that Will isn't open to changing his views. In such cases, distancing might be necessary for Alex's own well-being and to not be complicit in Will's harmful actions.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Will. Without friends, his mental health could deteriorate further. However, Will's behavior is a choice\u2014he's the one making decisions to act on his racism. If he truly wanted to change, he might seek help, but the narrative suggests he hasn't. So, Alex's decision might be a responsible choice to protect himself and others from Will's toxic behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, people are not obligated to remain friends with someone who is harmful. While empathy is important, it's also about self-preservation and preventing harm. Alex is not the one causing the racism; he's reacting to it. Therefore, his decision to end the friendship isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that he could have handled it differently, like trying to address the issue first, but given the severity and persistence of Will's actions, cutting off might be justified.\n"
