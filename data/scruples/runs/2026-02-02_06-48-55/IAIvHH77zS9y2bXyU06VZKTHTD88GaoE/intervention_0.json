Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Will was a close friend since childhood, but over time, he's shown racist behavior escalating from subtle slurs to aggressive outbursts. The author tried to distance themselves before, but finally cut off contact after a recent incident in a group chat. The author is conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's decision to cut him off. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that affects others and can't be ignored. The author is protecting their own well-being and possibly others by distancing themselves. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues, and the author might feel guilty for abandoning him when he needs support.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't being asked to enable harmful behavior. Ending a friendship, especially when someone is being harmful, isn't inherently wrong. The author is standing by their values and setting boundaries. However, the author might have considered other options before completely cutting off contact, like having a serious conversation about the racism or encouraging Will to seek help for both his racism and mental health issues. But in the scenario, the author mentions they had tried to distance themselves before, and the final incident was the last straw. \n\nIt's possible that the author is in the right because they're not responsible for Will's actions or his mental health struggles. They can't be expected to be his sole support system, especially when he's harmful. However, some might argue that the author could have done more to help, but given the circumstances, it's a personal choice. The answer would depend on whether cutting off contact is the right decision in this context. Since the author is protecting themselves and others from racism, which is a significant issue, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
