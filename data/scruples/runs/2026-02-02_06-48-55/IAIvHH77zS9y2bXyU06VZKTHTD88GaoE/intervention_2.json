Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their close friend Will because he's a racist. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend Will has been racist since they were kids. The author mentions specific incidents, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. That's pretty clear racial discrimination. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but maybe didn't cut off completely until the recent incident where Will targeted someone in a group chat.\n\nBut there's another layer: Will has depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, self-harm, and the author is his only friend. The author is conflicted because while Will's racism is harmful, they feel guilty for abandoning someone who's struggling mentally.\n\nSo, on one hand, Will's actions are clearly harmful and racist. The author has a right to protect themselves from someone who spreads hate and makes them uncomfortable. On the other hand, the author is his only friend, and cutting off suddenly might leave Will without support.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Is it wrong to cut off a racist friend, even if they have mental health issues? The author tried to distance earlier but finally did leave when the racism kept escalating. The author's guilt is understandable, but is it their fault? Maybe not. They can't be held responsible for Will's choices. However, maybe they could have tried to help him change instead of cutting off, but that's not always possible, especially if the friend isn't open to changing.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions are about self-preservation and standing up against racism, which is a valid reason. While the guilt exists, they aren't the ones spreading hate. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Like, did the author give Will a chance to improve? The author tried to distance earlier but the racism kept getting worse. The final incident was the breaking point. So it's reasonable to leave. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
