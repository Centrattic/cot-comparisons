Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. The friend, Will, grew up in a racist household and has shown aggressive racist behavior, even using slurs and targeting minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before but now decided to cut off completely after another incident. The author is concerned about Will's mental health but feels justified due to Will's racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds such harmful views can be problematic. However, the author's friend has underlying mental health issues, which complicates things. The author is his only friend, so cutting off might leave Will without support, which could worsen his mental health.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against racism, which is important. On the other hand, they might be abandoning someone in need. The key points are whether the author's actions were justified given the severity of Will's racism versus their mental health. \n\nSome might argue that supporting someone's harmful behavior isn't the right approach, and that the author is protecting themselves and others. Others might say that the author should have tried to help Will address his racism instead of cutting off entirely. However, considering Will's aggressive behavior and the author's own safety and well-being, it's understandable they took a stand.\n\nThe question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the answer hinges on the idea that everyone deserves support, even if they have flaws, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the answer emphasizes the importance of not enabling racism and protecting oneself from toxic behavior, then the author is not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that Will's upbringing contributed to his racism, but he's an adult responsible for his actions. The author isn't obligated to stay friends with someone who's harmful. The final decision would balance these factors. Given that the author tried to distance before, and the final incident was a straw, it's more about self-respect and safety. So likely, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
