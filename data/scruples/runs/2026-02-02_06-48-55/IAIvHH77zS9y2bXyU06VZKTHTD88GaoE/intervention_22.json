Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend, Will, who is racist but also has depression and other issues like anorexia and self-harm. The author has been close friends with Will since childhood but can't handle his racism anymore and cut him off after a final incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's actions: they've been friends with Will for a long time, but his racism has been escalating. The author tried to distance themselves before, but eventually blocked him and avoids him now. The question is if the author is in the wrong for doing that, given Will's mental health issues.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author has to deal with Will's harmful behavior, which includes using racial slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. Standing up against racism is generally seen as the right thing to do. The author might feel that they can't support a friend who holds such harmful views, even if the friend is struggling with mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, Will is dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. He's isolated, and the author was his only friend. Cutting off contact might leave him without any support system, which could potentially worsen his mental health. The author is conflicted because they care about Will's well-being but can't tolerate his racism.\n\nSo the dilemma is between supporting someone's mental health and refusing to condone racism. The author chose to cut ties, which is understandable, but maybe they could have sought help for Will instead of just leaving. However, the author might not be in the position to provide that help, especially if they're a peer. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they can't be expected to enable harmful behavior. However, there's also a responsibility to ensure that someone in crisis isn't left without support. The author might have done both by distancing from Will's racism while still encouraging him to seek professional help. But since they didn't mention trying that, maybe they are partially at fault for not exhausting other options before cutting off completely.\n\nAlternatively, if the author felt that continuing the friendship would compromise their own values or put others at risk, then their decision is justified. The final incident in the group chat being the last straw suggests that Will's behavior is persistent and harmful, so the author's action is a response to ongoing issues.\n\nIn summary, while the author's decision to end the friendship over racism is understandable and morally sound, their inaction in helping Will with his mental health could be a point against them. However, the primary issue is the racism, which is a significant reason to end the friendship. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
