Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend because of his racism and other issues. The author, let's call them Alex, had a friend named Will since primary school. Will has depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, self-harms, and is a racist. Alex is conflicted between cutting him off due to Will's harmful behavior but feeling guilty because of his mental health struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Will's racism is a serious issue. The examples given include using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making someone feel unwelcome. These are clear instances of hate speech and discrimination, which are unacceptable. Even if someone has mental health issues, that doesn't justify their harmful actions. \n\nHowever, Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. He's isolated, with Alex being his only friend. The user's friend feels guilty about abandoning him. So, the question is whether cutting off a friend who has mental health issues is wrong, especially when they're harmful.\n\nI have to consider if Alex had other options. Maybe they could have tried to help Will address his racism while maintaining boundaries. For example, confronting him about his behavior, suggesting therapy, or seeking support for themselves. But if Will's behavior continued despite these efforts, then it's reasonable to distance oneself for personal safety and well-being.\n\nThe key points are the severity of Will's actions (racism is a serious issue) versus the mental health aspect. Mental illness doesn't excuse harmful behavior. However, the act of cutting off a friend without trying to help them might leave the person in a worse situation. But in this case, Alex tried to distance earlier but couldn't due to Will's mental state. The final incident in the group chat was the breaking point.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. If Alex is protecting themselves from a friend who is both mentally unwell and actively harmful, then maybe it's not wrong. But if they could have done more to support Will, perhaps they are at fault. However, given that Will's racist behavior is ongoing and harmful, and Alex has already made attempts to distance, the decision to cut off might be justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
