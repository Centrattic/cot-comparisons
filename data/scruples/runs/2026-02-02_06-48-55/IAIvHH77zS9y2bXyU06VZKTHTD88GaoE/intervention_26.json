Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their best friend, Will, due to his racism, despite his mental health issues. \n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's been using racial slurs, targeting minorities, and made a derogatory comment about someone's face. Those are serious issues that can't be justified. Racism is a social harm and can be hurtful not just to individuals but to communities. The user tried to address this before, but it escalated.\n\nNow, Will's mental health is a factor. He's depressed, anorexic, anxious, self-harms, and the user is his only friend. That's a lot. But the question is whether the user is wrong to distance themselves. Supporting someone's mental health is important, but that doesn't mean condoning harmful behavior. It's a balance between accountability and compassion.\n\nThe user did try to manage the friendship earlier, but when Will's actions became more aggressive and hurtful, the user had to make a choice. Staying in a toxic friendship where racism is normalized isn't healthy. The user might have a duty to protect others from Will's behavior, but they also feel conflicted about abandoning a friend in need.\n\nHowever, ending a friendship isn't always a bad thing, especially if one person's actions are harmful. It's possible to be right in choosing not to support toxic behavior, even if the person has their own struggles. The user might not be entirely at fault. \n\nBut maybe they could have tried more to help Will seek help for his racism and mental health. However, if Will wasn't receptive, the user's hands might be tied. The final straw was in a group chat, which is a public or semi-public setting where the racism was directed at someone else. That's a clear boundary crosser. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They're not responsible for fixing someone else's issues, especially when those issues are harmful to others. The answer is B.\n"
