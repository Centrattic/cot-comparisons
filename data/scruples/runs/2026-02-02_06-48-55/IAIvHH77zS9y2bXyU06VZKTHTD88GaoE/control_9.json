Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the writer has known Will since primary school, making it a long-term friendship. Will was raised in a racist environment, which might explain some of his behavior. The writer mentions specific instances where Will's racism escalated over time, from using racial slurs behind others' backs to aggressive outbursts and even using a racial slur directly at someone. That seems pretty serious.\n\nThe writer also acknowledges Will's mental health struggles: depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. They feel conflicted because Will is their only support system, but his actions are unacceptable. The final incident in the group chat was the breaking point, leading the writer to cut off contact entirely.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the writer is at fault. On one hand, racism is a serious issue and the writer has the right to distance themselves from someone whose actions are harmful and discriminatory. On the other hand, Will's mental health is clearly in a bad place, and he might truly be suffering. The writer might feel guilty for abandoning a friend who needs support, but they might also feel they can't condone racists behavior.\n\nIt's important to consider that while mental health issues can contribute to someone's behavior, they don't excuse harmful actions like racism. The writer is prioritizing their own boundaries and safety, which is valid. However, completely cutting off someone without trying to address the issue or offer help could be seen as harsh, especially if Will is genuinely struggling. Maybe the writer could have tried to have a difficult conversation, set clear boundaries, or encouraged Will to seek professional help before deciding to end the friendship.\n\nBut given the severity of Will's actions, especially the direct racial slur and aggression, it's understandable that the writer felt it was necessary to end the friendship for their own well-being. The writer isn't obligated to stay in a toxic relationship, even if the person has mental health issues. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they are protecting themselves from harmful behavior.\n"
