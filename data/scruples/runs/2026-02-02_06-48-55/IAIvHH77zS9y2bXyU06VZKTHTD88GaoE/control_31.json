Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, who is a racist despite having depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend, Will, has been displaying racist behavior over time. From small things like using racial slurs behind others' backs to more aggressive incidents like yelling at Black individuals with racial slurs. The worst part was when he called someone the n-word and said it made him angry. The user tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, self-harm, and is their only friend. The final incident was in a group chat where he targeted a Black person again, leading the user to block him and avoid him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. It's harmful and unjust. Standing up against racism is important, not just for the victims but for society. The user's decision to cut off a friend who consistently uses racist slurs and targets minorities could be seen as the right choice, especially since they've tried to distance before. The user isn't just being cruel but is responding to ongoing harmful behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health issues. The user is his only friend, which adds complexity. The user might feel guilty for abandoning him when he's struggling. However, enabling harmful behavior, even if someone is suffering, isn't necessarily the right approach. People can have both mental health issues and engage in harmful behavior that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe user's actions were a response to repeated racist behavior, which is a valid reason to end a friendship. They might also be protecting themselves from being harmed by Will's actions. It's important to prioritize one's own safety and well-being. The user isn't ignoring the fact that Will is struggling, but they're choosing not to support behavior that's racist.\n\nBut there's a balance. If the user could provide support to Will to address his racism without enabling it, that might be better. However, the user might not be equipped to handle it, especially if Will isn't open to changing. In this case, the user took a stand against racism, which is a positive action. They are not in the wrong for protecting themselves and not supporting racism, even if it means losing a friend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
