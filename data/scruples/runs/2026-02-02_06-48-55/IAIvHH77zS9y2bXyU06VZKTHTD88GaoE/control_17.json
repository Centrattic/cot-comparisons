Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by cutting off their friend Will due to his racist behavior and harmful actions, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Will has a history of racism, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before, but after an incident in a group chat, they completely cut off contact. The author is torn because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The key question is whether the author's decision to abandon their friend was justified given Will's harmful actions.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author was subjected to Will's racist remarks and actions, which are not acceptable. Standing up against racism is important, and the author might be protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. It's understandable that after several incidents, the author felt the need to distance themselves, especially since Will's behavior escalated over time.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health struggles, and the author feels guilt about cutting him off. However, it's important to note that while mental health is a factor, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author isn't abandoning Will because of his mental health but because of his actions. It's also possible that by removing themselves from a toxic environment, the author is prioritizing their own well-being and safety.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might still feel responsible for Will's well-being. However, the responsibility for Will's behavior lies with him. The author isn't obligated to remain in a friendship that is causing them harm. It's a balance between empathy for Will's struggles and the need to protect oneself from racism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to cut off a friend who exhibits racist behavior, especially after multiple incidents, seems justified. Mental health shouldn't be used as an excuse for harmful actions. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values and safety.\n"
