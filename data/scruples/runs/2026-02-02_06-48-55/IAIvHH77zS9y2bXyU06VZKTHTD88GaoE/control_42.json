Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known Will since primary school, so they're close. Will grew up in a racist environment and has developed racist behaviors over time. The author mentions instances where Will uses racial slurs, targets minorities, and even made a derogatory comment using the n-word. But Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The final straw was a recent incident in a group chat with a black person where Will attacked them. The author blocked him and avoids him now, but feels guilty because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the severity of Will's racism and the author's decision to distance themselves. Racism is a serious issue, and enabling harmful behavior can have negative consequences. However, the author is concerned about Will's mental health, which complicates things.\n\nI should consider the responsibility of the author. They tried to be friends and tolerated Will's behavior up to a point. But when Will's actions became aggressive and racist, the author felt they had to cut ties. The author might be right to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. On the other hand, cutting off someone who is struggling with mental health could be seen as abandoning them when they need support. But there's a balance between supporting someone and enabling harmful actions.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they've reached their limit after repeated harmful actions. However, maybe they could have tried to help Will seek professional help first. But if Will isn't open to changing his behavior, the author isn't responsible for fixing his issues. The author's mental health and the need to protect others from Will's racism are also valid concerns.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision to distance themselves is understandable to protect others and themselves. While it's a tough choice, especially given Will's mental health, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their boundaries and safety.\n"
