Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, let's call them Alex, having a best friend named Will who's been their friend since primary school. Will has depression and other issues like anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, but he's also a racist. The question is whether Alex did the right thing by cutting off Will after a final incident in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will's racism is a major issue here. The examples given are that he uses racial slurs, targets minorities, and even uses the n-word. Those are serious acts of racism and hate speech. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health problems, which might make the situation more complex. He's described as being in a bad place, with self-harm and being an only friend for Alex. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is to determine if that's the case. The user is seeking an opinion. The main factors here are the severity of Will's actions versus the author's decision to distance themselves. \n\nRacism is a serious offense, and protecting oneself from harmful behavior is important. The author might have felt that they couldn't continue the friendship given Will's harmful actions. However, the author also acknowledges Will's mental health struggles, which adds a layer of complexity. But does that justify the harmful behavior? Probably not. People with mental health issues can still be held accountable for their actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as abandoning someone in need. But if the friendship is toxic and harmful, maybe the author is protecting themselves. The line between cutting off someone who's harmful versus supporting them despite their issues is tricky. The author might have a right to prioritize their own well-being and values, especially when faced with racism, which is a significant issue. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have tried to address the racism in the friendship first, like confronting Will and trying to support him in changing his behavior. But given that Will's behavior escalated over time and included aggressive and hurtful acts, maybe the author felt it was necessary to cut off to protect not just themselves but others from Will's actions. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves when the friendship became harmful. The key is whether the author is taking responsibility for their own boundaries and not enabling harmful behavior. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, perhaps thinking that they should have stayed and supported Will, but considering the severity of the racism, the author's decision could be justified. \n\nSo, weighing the facts: the author is not in the wrong for cutting off a friend who is openly racist and harmful, despite the friend's mental health issues. The author's actions are about self-preservation and not condoning racism. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
