Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friend is clearly racist and has made several harmful comments and actions, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves but eventually cut off contact after a final incident. On the other hand, Will has depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, self-harms, and is socially isolated with the author being his only friend.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own boundaries against racism over supporting a friend with mental health issues. The argument against the author might be that they didn't try harder to help Will seek professional help or that cutting off contact abruptly didn't allow for any intervention. However, the author might argue that Will's behavior is harmful and that they cannot be responsible for someone else's mental health, especially when the friend's actions are so toxic and harmful to others.\n\nRacism is a serious issue that affects others, and the author has a right to protect themselves from being associated with such behavior. At the same time, the author might feel guilty because Will's mental health is fragile. But it's important to recognize that the author isn't responsible for Will's actions or his mental health treatment. The decision to end the friendship could be seen as necessary for their own well-being and to not condone Will's harmful behavior.\n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to distance themselves from someone who is racist, especially when the person's behavior is harmful. While it's sad for Will's mental health, the author isn't obligated to be his sole support system, especially when the friendship is one-sided and harmful.\n"
