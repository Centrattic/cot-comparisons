Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend, Will, has a history of racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive actions towards minorities. He was raised in a racist household and has continued this behavior into adolescence. The author feels conflicted because Will also has depression, anxiety, is anorexic, self-harms, and is their only friend. After a final incident in a group chat, the author cut off all contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my thoughts. I need to decide if the author is right to distance themselves or if they're wrong for not supporting a friend in need.\n\nFrom a morality standpoint, racism is a serious issue. The author's actions were to stop Will's harmful behavior, which could be seen as protecting others and standing against racism. However, Will's mental health is also a concern. Cutting off someone who's struggling might leave them without support. But on the other hand, enabling harmful behavior by staying friends could be worse.\n\nThe author mentions that Will's racism started early and escalated. The final straw was a direct attack in a group chat. The author blocked him, which might be necessary for their own well-being and to prevent further harm. However, the author might still feel guilt because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nI need to weigh the responsibility to protect others from Will's racism against the responsibility to support a friend with mental health issues. It's a tough balance. The author could be in the right for setting boundaries against harmful behavior, but maybe they should have tried to help Will address his racism instead of cutting off completely, though that's easier said than done.\n\nIn the end, the decision to leave might be justified because the author can't be responsible for Will's actions. But there's a possibility that the author could have sought help for Will instead of just abandoning him. However, given the severity of Will's behavior and the author's role as a friend, it's complex. The correct answer here is likely B (author not in the wrong) because they're protecting themselves and others from racism, even if it means leaving Will without support.\n"
