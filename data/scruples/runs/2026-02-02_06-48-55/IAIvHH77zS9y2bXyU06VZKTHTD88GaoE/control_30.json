Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong, right? Let's see. The situation is about their best friend, Will, who is racist but also has depression and other mental health issues. The author is asking if they did the wrong thing by cutting off Will because of his racism.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. Will was raised in a racist household and started showing racist behavior from a young age. The author noticed this when they were teenagers. At 16, Will was aggressive towards minorities, using racial slurs and making others feel targeted. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is also depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harms. The final incident was in a group chat where Will attacked another black person, leading the author to block him and avoid him entirely.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Will. On one hand, Will's racism is clearly harmful and offensive. Racism is a serious issue that affects others negatively, and the author might be trying to protect themselves and others from Will's behavior. Also, the author mentions that they tried to distance themselves earlier but couldn't because of Will's mental health struggles and the fact that the author was his only friend.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting someone off completely might have consequences for Will's mental health. He's already struggling with depression and other issues, and losing his only friend could make it worse. But the author might feel that they can't support someone with such harmful beliefs, especially when it's hurting others.\n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author tried to talk to Will about his behavior, encouraged him to seek help, or tried to support him while setting boundaries. However, from the description, it seems like Will's behavior escalated over time and didn't improve. The final incident was the breaking point. \n\nAlso, mental illness doesn't excuse racist behavior. While it's important to support someone with mental health issues, it's equally important to not condone harmful actions. The author might be making a decision to protect themselves and others from Will's actions, even if it means losing a friend.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had other responsibilities. Since Will is the author's only friend and relies on them, maybe the author felt they couldn't leave. But the author might also feel that staying in the friendship was enabling Will's harmful behavior. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to set boundaries for their own well-being. If someone's behavior is toxic and harmful, leaving might be the right choice, even if the person is struggling with mental health issues. However, it's possible that the author could have done more to help Will, like suggesting therapy or support groups, but given Will's resistance (since he was aggressive and didn't change his behavior), maybe it was unavoidable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision to cut off Will after repeated harmful actions might be justified. They are protecting themselves and others from racism, which is a significant issue. While it's sad that Will is struggling, the author isn't responsible for his mental health, especially when he contributed to a toxic environment. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
