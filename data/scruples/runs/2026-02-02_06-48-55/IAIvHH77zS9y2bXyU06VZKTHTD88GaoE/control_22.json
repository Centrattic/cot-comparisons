Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite his depression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will was raised in a racist household and has shown racist behavior over the years, escalating from minor slurs to aggressive acts. The author mentions that Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, self-harm, and anxiety. The final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person, leading the author to block him. Now they feel guilty because Will is struggling mentally.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's mental health issues. The author is torn between cutting off a toxic friend and feeling responsible for his well-being. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. The examples given, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities, are harmful and unacceptable. The author's decision to distance themselves could be seen as protecting others from Will's harmful behavior and also protecting their own mental health. However, Will's mental health struggles add complexity.\n\nBut in evaluating if the author is in the wrong, it's important to consider that while mental health issues are valid, they don't excuse harmful behavior. The author isn't responsible for Will's actions or his mental health; they can't be expected to enable someone who is racist. The final straw was the group chat incident, which might have been the last in a series of harmful actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel guilty because they were Will's only friend. But friends have a right to set boundaries, especially when someone's behavior is harmful. It's possible that Will's racism is part of a deeper issue, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's toxic or dangerous, especially if Will isn't seeking help for his racism.\n\nSo, considering the harm caused by Will's actions and the author's right to self-preservation, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted to protect themselves and others, and while it's compassionate to feel guilt, they aren't responsible for Will's choices or his mental health beyond a certain point.\n"
