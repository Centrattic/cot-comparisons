Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, who is a racist but also has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since primary school, so there's a long history. Will's racism starts small, like using racial slurs behind others' backs when annoyed. Then escalates to aggressive behavior, including targeting minorities with racial slurs. The example given where he tells two black people to leave using the n-word and swears at them is pretty severe. \n\nThe author tried to distance themselves before, but because Will is their only friend and has significant mental health issues\u2014depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm\u2014they felt conflicted. The final incident happened in a group chat where Will attacked someone again, leading the author to block him and avoid him. Now they're questioning if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. Standing up against racism is important, especially when it's aggressive and directed at others. The author might be protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. Also, cutting off a toxic friend who's harmful could be necessary for their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health struggles, and the author is his only friend. They might feel guilty for leaving him, especially since he's in a bad place. The question is whether the author is being inconsiderate by not supporting him despite his flaws. However, supporting someone's harmful behavior isn't healthy either. The author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship, especially when there's no effort from Will to change his racist views.\n\nThe challenge here is balancing empathy for Will's mental health with the need to address his racism. The author isn't responsible for Will's upbringing, so they can't be blamed for not fixing his issues. The final incident was the last straw, and the author took a stand, which is a valid decision. They aren't in the wrong because they prioritized their values and safety over the friendship, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
