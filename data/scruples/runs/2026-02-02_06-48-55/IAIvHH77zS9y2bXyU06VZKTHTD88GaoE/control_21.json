Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who's a racist but also has depression and other issues. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nWill was raised in a racist household and has shown racist behavior over the years, escalating from subtle slurs to aggressive outbursts with racial slurs. The author tried to distance themselves before but finally cut off contact after a recent incident in a group chat. However, Will has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend. The author is conflicted because they feel bad about abandoning him even though his behavior is unacceptable.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's decision to end the friendship. Racism is a serious issue that affects others and can cause harm. The author has a right to set boundaries to protect themselves from being associated with Will's behavior. However, the author is also concerned about Will's mental health and being his only friend. \n\nBut, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, ending a toxic friendship is a personal choice, especially when the friend's actions are harmful. On the other hand, the author might feel responsible because of their close history and Will's mental state. However, Will's racism is a choice that he's made, even if it's influenced by his upbringing. The author can't be held responsible for Will's actions. The author is justified in protecting their own well-being and distancing from someone who spreads hate, even if that person is in need of support. The author isn't obligated to be the sole support system for someone whose behavior is harmful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to end the friendship to protect themselves and others from Will's racism. The mental health aspect is important, but it doesn't obligate the author to stay in a harmful relationship.\n"
