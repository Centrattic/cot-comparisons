Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, because of his racism. The friend has a history of racist behavior that escalated over time, including using racial slurs and being aggressive towards minorities. However, Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is the author's only friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who spreads hate can be harmful. The author tried to distance themselves before but now took a firm stand by blocking Will. On the other hand, Will has mental health struggles, and the author feels guilty about abandoning him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is justified in cutting off a toxic friend who engages in harmful behavior, even if that friend is vulnerable. The author might have a responsibility to not enable Will's racism, even if it means losing a friendship. However, completely cutting off someone with severe mental health issues without support could be seen as harsh. But the key here is that Will's behavior is actively harmful and the author tried to be a friend before. The line was crossed when Will targeted a black person in a group chat, leading to the author's decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their values and others from harm, even though it's difficult. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
