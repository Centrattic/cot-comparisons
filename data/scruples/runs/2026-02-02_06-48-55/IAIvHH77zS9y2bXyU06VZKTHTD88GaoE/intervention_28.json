Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to his racism and mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the friendship started in primary school, so it's long-term. Will has a history of racism, starting with minor slurs and escalating to aggressive behavior. The key incident was when Will used a racial slur and told two Black people to leave the park. The author tried to distance themselves but stayed because Will is depressed, anorexic, anxious, self-harms, and has no other friends. Then, after another racist outburst in a group chat with a Black person, the author blocked Will on all platforms.\n\nThe author's dilemma is whether they're at fault for cutting off a friend who has serious mental health issues but also harmful behavior. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the answer. \n\nI need to consider the balance between standing up against racism and the empathy for a friend's mental health. Racism is a serious issue that can cause harm, and enabling such behavior can be problematic. However, the author might feel conflicted about cutting off someone in need. \n\nBut the author tried to distance before, and the final straw was another racist incident. The decision to cut off might be a way to protect others from Will's harmful actions and also to avoid enabling his toxic behavior. While Will's mental health is a factor, the author isn't responsible for his actions or his well-being beyond a certain point. The author's safety and ethical stance against racism are valid reasons to end the friendship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
