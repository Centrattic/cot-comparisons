Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other issues. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they're at fault for distancing themselves from Will after years of dealing with his racism. The key points here are Will's racist behavior and his mental health issues. The author was friends with Will since childhood but found his racism increasingly disturbing over time. There were specific incidents, like using racial slurs and aggressive outbursts towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before, but given Will's depression, anorexia, self-harm, and being his only friend, they felt conflicted. The final incident in a group chat pushed the author to cut off contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. They're also concerned about their own well-being, as being around a racist person can be toxic. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles, and the author might feel guilty for leaving him when he's vulnerable. But, Will's actions are not excusable just because of his mental health. He's responsible for his behavior, and the author has the right to set boundaries to protect themselves.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as justified because they're prioritizing their own mental health and standing against racism. However, there's a part of them that's worried about Will's well-being. But maybe the author isn't at fault here. They can't be expected to be friends with someone who's harmful, regardless of that person's issues. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't wrong for choosing to leave.\n"
