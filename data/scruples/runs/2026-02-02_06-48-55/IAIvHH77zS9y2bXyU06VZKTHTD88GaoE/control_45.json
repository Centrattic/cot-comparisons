Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend named Will who is racist but also has depression, mental health issues, and self-harms. The author cut off Will after a racist incident in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will has been a friend since primary school, but his racism became more apparent as they grew older. There were specific instances like using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and the incident in the park. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but didn't cut off completely until the recent group chat incident. Now, they're avoiding Will, and they're wondering if they're in the wrong because of his mental health issues.\n\nOn one hand, Will's racism is a serious issue. The author has been a victim of his behavior, and it's their right to protect their own well-being by cutting ties. Racism is harmful and shouldn't be tolerated, especially when it's directed at others. The author's decision to leave might be justified as they have the right to surround themselves with people who respect everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is struggling with depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harm. The author feels guilty because he's their only friend. There's a moral dilemma here between standing up for one's values and not abandoning someone in need. But it's important to remember that the author isn't obligated to be Will's only support system. They can't be responsible for his mental health issues, especially if his actions are harmful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author faced racist behavior from Will, which is a serious issue, and their decision to cut ties is a personal choice to protect themselves and others, it's likely that they aren't in the wrong. However, some might argue they could have tried to help Will instead of cutting off completely. But given the severity of Will's actions and the fact that the author was the only friend, it's a complex situation. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they have the right to set boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
