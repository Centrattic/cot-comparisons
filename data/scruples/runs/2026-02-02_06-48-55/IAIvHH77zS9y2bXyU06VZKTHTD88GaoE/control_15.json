Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the friend has been making offensive comments and acting out in a racist way. The author did try to distance themselves earlier but now took a stronger step after a final incident. Racism is a serious issue, and standing up against it is important. The author might feel justified in protecting their own values and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, and self-harms. He's vulnerable and the author is his only friend. The author might be struggling with guilt for abandoning him, even though his behavior was harmful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and values over maintaining a toxic friendship.\n\nI should think about the impact of the author's actions. Cutting off contact could hurt Will, but allowing the friendship to continue might enable harmful behavior. The author might have a responsibility to themselves to not tolerate racism, even if the person is suffering. However, there's also a part of them that feels responsible for Will's mental health.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is not obligated to stay in a friendship that harms them. They can't be expected to enable or condone Will's racism. While it's sad that Will is struggling, the author's mental health and values are also important. The author might have a duty to themselves to remove themselves from a toxic situation.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a difficult but justified decision to protect themselves from a friend's harmful behavior, even though they care about Will's well-being.\n"
