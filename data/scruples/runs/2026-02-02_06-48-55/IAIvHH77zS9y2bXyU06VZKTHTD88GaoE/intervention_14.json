Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, who's a racist but also has depression. The author is conflicted because they don't want to support racism, but they also feel bad about Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will's racism is a big problem. He's been using racial slurs, being aggressive towards minorities, even using the n-word. That's clearly harmful and unacceptable. The author tried to distance themselves before but now took a firm stance by blocking him. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has depression, is anorexic, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The author is struggling with guilt because they abandoned him during a vulnerable time. \n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. Is the author in the wrong for cutting off a racist friend? Well, supporting harmful behavior isn't right. Just because someone is struggling with mental health doesn't mean they can't be held accountable for their actions. The author tried to be a friend but maybe realized they can't enable racism. However, completely cutting off might not be the best approach, but maybe they felt it was necessary for their own well-being and to not support racism. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a form of self-protection and standing up against racism. While it's important to support friends in need, that support shouldn't come at the cost of condoning racism. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. Maybe they could have tried to help Will in another way, but given the severity of his actions and the author's own well-being, cutting off might be justified. \n\nBut there's a balance. Sometimes, even if someone is problematic, you can try to help them seek professional help. However, the author might feel they can't do that anymore, especially if Will's racism is deeply ingrained and harmful. Also, the author's mental health and safety are important. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves from a racist friend, even if that friend is struggling with mental health. Setting boundaries is important. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
