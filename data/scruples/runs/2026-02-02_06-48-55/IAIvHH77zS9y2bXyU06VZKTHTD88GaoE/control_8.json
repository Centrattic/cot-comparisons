Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because of his racism, despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the key points: Will has a history of racist behavior, from minor slurs to aggressive outbursts. The author tried to distance themselves before but now decided to cut off after another incident. Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and the author is his only friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that's harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. Cutting off a friend who's a bigot might be justified because supporting such behavior is problematic. The author's actions could be seen as standing up against racism, which is a moral stance.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles. The author might feel conflicted because they care about him. But the author isn't responsible for Will's well-being, and enabling his behavior by staying friends could be harmful. The author might need to set boundaries for their own mental health too.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether supporting a racist friend is acceptable, especially when the friend's mental health is not the author's responsibility. The author made a tough choice but it's about protecting themselves from toxic behavior. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
