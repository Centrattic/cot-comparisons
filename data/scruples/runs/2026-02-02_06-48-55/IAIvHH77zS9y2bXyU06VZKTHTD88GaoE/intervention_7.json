Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to his racism and other issues. The author and Will have been friends since primary school, which is a long time, but Will's racism becomes a problem. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. Will's behavior includes using racial slurs, aggressive actions towards minorities, and making derogatory comments. That's clearly harmful and wrong. The author was aware of this for a long time but only took action after an incident in a group chat. \n\nThen there's the aspect of Will being depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harming. The author feels conflicted because they're his only friend. The question is whether it's wrong to cut off someone with mental health issues due to their racism.\n\nThe author's actions are a response to Will's harmful behavior. They tried to be understanding before, but the final incident pushed them to end contact. The key here is balancing personal boundaries with compassion. Even though Will has mental health issues, the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship. However, the abrupt cut-off without any attempt at support or intervention might be seen as harsh.\n\nBut the core issue is that Will's racism is unacceptable. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their own well-being and safety. The fact that Will has mental health issues doesn't excuse his racism, but the author's responsibility to support him is weighed against his harmful actions. The author might have a point in feeling conflicted, but they aren't necessarily wrong for ending the friendship given the severity of Will's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries against racism, even if it means ending a friendship. However, they could be encouraged to seek professional help for Will if possible, but that's beyond their responsibility.\n"
