Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for abandoning their best friend Will because he's a racist. The friend has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. The writer is torn because Will is their closest friend but behaves in a harmful and racist way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Will's racism is clearly a big issue. The writer has tried to distance themselves but was also concerned about Will's mental health. The key points are the severity of Will's actions and the writer's responsibility. \n\nThe writer mentions specific incidents where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities. That's not minor; that's hurtful and harmful behavior. The writer was friends with someone who was being victimized, so they were on his side, but Will still acted out. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is wrong to cut off contact. On one hand, supporting a friend with depression is important, but enabling harmful behavior isn't. If Will's racism is part of his toxic behavior, the writer might be doing the right thing by prioritizing their own values and the well-being of others over a friendship that's causing harm. \n\nBut then, the writer is feeling guilty because Will is in a bad place mentally. However, the writer isn't responsible for fixing his issues. They've already tried to address the behavior, and when it continued, stepping back could be necessary. \n\nThe choice between A and B depends on whether the author's actions were justified. Since Will's behavior was actively harmful and the writer couldn't tolerate it anymore, it's likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
