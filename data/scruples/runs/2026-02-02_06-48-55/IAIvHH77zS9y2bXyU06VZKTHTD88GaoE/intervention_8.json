Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Will, who's a racist but also has depression and other mental health issues. The author is asking if they're at fault for cutting off Will after his racist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Will's racism is a major issue. The author describes Will using racial slurs, being aggressive towards minorities, and making racist comments. That's clearly harmful and wrong. The author tried to distance themselves earlier, but eventually decided to cut off contact after another incident. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health struggles. He's anorexic, self-harms, anxious, and is the author's only friend. The author is conflicted because they care about him but can't tolerate his racism. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. From an ethical standpoint, racism is a serious problem, and supporting or enabling racist behavior is not acceptable. The author isn't wrong for not condoning Will's actions. However, cutting off someone who's in a vulnerable state might be seen as harsh. But the author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they've already tried to be a friend. \n\nSome might argue that the author could have sought help or tried to support Will in a different way, but given the severity of the racism, it's also important to protect others and not enable harmful behavior. The author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship, especially if they're not making progress in helping Will. \n\nIn conclusion, the author prioritized their own boundaries and the well-being of others, which is understandable. While it's a tough situation, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship when it's clear that Will's actions are harmful and unchangeable.\n"
