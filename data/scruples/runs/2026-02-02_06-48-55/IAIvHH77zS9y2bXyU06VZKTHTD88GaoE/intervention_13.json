Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend named Will, who has depression and is a racist. The author blocked and avoided Will after he made racist remarks again. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since childhood, so the friendship is significant. Will's racism is a serious issue, especially his use of racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. However, Will also has mental health issues: anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and depression. The author is his only friend.\n\nThe author's action was to cut off contact after a final incident. The question is whether this action was wrong. On one hand, racism is a major problem, and the author might be protecting others and themselves from Will's harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with depression and mental health, which the author feels conflicted about. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to continue the friendship despite Will's harmful actions? Or is it reasonable to set boundaries when someone's behavior is harmful? The author might be in the right because they can't be expected to support someone's harmful behavior, even if they have mental health issues. But then again, maybe they could have tried to address the racism first, like confronting him or seeking help together. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that they had already tried to distance themselves before, but the situation escalated. The final incident was a breaking point. It's possible that the author's decision was necessary for their own well-being and to not support Will's toxic actions. Mental health is important, but so is standing against racism. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people with mental health issues engage in harmful behaviors as a result of their condition. But that doesn't excuse the racism. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues; they can choose their own boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel conflicted, their decision to cut off contact could be justified given Will's harmful actions. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
