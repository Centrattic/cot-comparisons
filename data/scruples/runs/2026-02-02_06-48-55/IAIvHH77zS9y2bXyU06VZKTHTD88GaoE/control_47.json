Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who cut off their friend Will is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nWill is a long-time friend who has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is a racist. The friend, the author, is struggling because Will's racism is really problematic, but they also feel bad because Will is dealing with mental health issues and they're his only friend.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's behavior. The racism starts with slurs and progresses to aggressive actions, like targeting minorities in a park and using racial slurs. The author tried to distance themselves before, but after a particularly bad incident in a group chat, they cut him off completely.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. On one hand, Will has mental health issues, which makes it more complicated. The author might feel guilty for leaving him. But on the other hand, Will's actions are harmful and harmful behavior shouldn't be tolerated. The author's decision to cut him off could be seen as self-preservation and standing against racism, which is a serious issue.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being the only friend. The author might be worried about Will's well-being. However, enabling harmful behavior by staying a friend could be worse. The friend's mental health is their own responsibility, and the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic relationship.\n\nI think the author is justified in cutting off Will because they can't be responsible for his actions. It's important to support mental health, but not at the expense of condoning racism. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
