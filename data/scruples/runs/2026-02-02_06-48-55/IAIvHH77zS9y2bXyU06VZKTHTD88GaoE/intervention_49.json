Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person left their friend because Will was using racial slurs and being aggressive towards minorities. The writer mentions that Will's racist behavior escalated over time, leading to a breaking point where they blocked him. On the other hand, Will is struggling with depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harm, and the writer is his only friend. \n\nSo, the key points are: the writer is distancing themselves from a racist friend, but they're also concerned about his mental health. The question is whether they are in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom one perspective, racism is a serious issue, and it's important to stand against it. If the writer was complicit by not confronting it earlier, then cutting off the friend could be justified. However, the writer did try to distance themselves over time but maybe didn't take stronger action earlier. \n\nOn the other side, leaving someone who's in a vulnerable mental state without support might exacerbate their issues. Will's mental health problems are severe, so abandoning him could lead to more harm. But at the same time, the writer isn't responsible for fixing all of Will's problems. They have the right to protect themselves from toxic behavior and racism.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the details. The writer's actions were in response to ongoing racist behavior, which is a significant red flag. However, leaving a friend who's struggling with mental health might leave them without support. \n\nBut is the writer responsible for Will's mental health? Or is it about their own moral stance against racism? The writer isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's harmful to them, especially if Will's behavior is unacceptable. However, maybe they could have tried to help Will get the support he needed instead of cutting him off entirely. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and whether there were alternatives. The writer's intent was to stop being complicit in racism, which is valid. But perhaps they could have done more to support Will's mental health while addressing the racism. \n\nBut given the severity of Will's actions (using racial slurs, aggressive behavior), the writer's decision to cut him off might be justified. They might not be in the wrong, especially if they tried to help but couldn't tolerate the racism anymore. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to protect themselves from racism and toxic behavior, even if their friend is struggling with mental health issues. While it's important to support friends in need, it's not the writer's responsibility to be the sole support, especially when the friend's actions are harmful.\n"
