Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has known Will since childhood and was his closest friend. Will's racism escalated over time, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author mentions a specific incident where Will targeted black people with racism and a slur. The author tried to distance themselves but continued the friendship because Will was struggling with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and was their only friend. However, after another racist outburst in a group chat, the author cut off all contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author had every right to protect themselves from Will's harmful behavior. Supporting someone's harmful behavior, even if they have mental health issues, isn't always the right approach. On the other hand, the author might feel conflicted because Will has mental health struggles and they were close friends.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author made a decision to end the friendship after repeated harmful actions. They tried to distance themselves before but couldn't fully cut ties until the final incident. Ending a toxic relationship to protect oneself isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author might be criticized for not trying to support Will's mental health while also holding him accountable for his racism. \n\nWait, but the author did try to support Will, being his only friend. But Will's racism is a choice that directly harms others. Mental health doesn't excuse racism. The author's decision to leave is about self-preservation and not enabling harmful behavior. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong. They had to prioritize their values and safety.\n"
