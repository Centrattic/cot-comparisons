Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for abandoning their friend because he's a racist despite being depressed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer, let's call them Person A, has a close friend named Will. They've been friends since primary school. Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. However, he's also a racist, with behaviors escalating from minor slurs to aggressive confrontations involving racial slurs. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading Person A to cut off all contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nSo, what factors determine if Person A is in the wrong? Well, the main points are:\n\n1. Will's racism is harmful and offensive. The examples given include using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. This is clearly wrong and harmful, regardless of his mental health issues.\n\n2. Person A's decision to cut contact is a form of disengagement to protect themselves and others. They might feel that Will's behavior is unacceptable and that they can't tolerate it anymore, even with his mental health struggles.\n\n3. However, Will has significant mental health issues and is socially isolated. Person A is his only friend, which adds a layer of concern. Cutting contact might leave him without support, potentially worsening his mental state.\n\nThe question is whether Person A's action is justified. On one hand, they are standing against racism and not enabling harmful behavior. On the other, they might be abandoning someone in need. But is it the author's responsibility to continue the friendship?\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, it's important to set boundaries against harmful behavior. While being supportive is good, enabling or remaining in a relationship where someone's actions are racist could be seen as complicit. At the same time, there's a moral consideration for those with mental health issues.\n\nBut Person A did try to distance themselves earlier, and this was the final incident. The decision to block and avoid is a personal choice for self-respect and safety. However, there's a responsibility to ensure that Will gets help, but they might not have that obligation if they've already tried to support him and he refused to change.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, considering that Will's behavior is harmful and the author made a decision to protect themselves, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are not responsible for how Will handles his mental health, especially if he's unwilling to address his racism. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle where they are at fault. Maybe if they could help him without enabling racism, but cutting contact is a valid choice.\n"
