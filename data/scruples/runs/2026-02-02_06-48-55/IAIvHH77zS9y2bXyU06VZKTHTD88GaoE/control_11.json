Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they're at fault for cutting off their best friend, Will, because he's a racist despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author has known Will since primary school, so they've been friends a long time. Will was raised in a racist environment and started showing racist behavior as they grew up. The examples given include using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and even making derogatory comments in front of others. The author tried to distance themselves over time, but Will has serious mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and he's their only friend.\n\nThe key issue here is the conflict between friendship, mental health, and Will's harmful behavior. The author finally blocks him after he targeted someone in a group chat. They're torn because they feel bad for cutting off someone who's struggling but can't deal with his racism anymore.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Setting boundaries is important, especially when someone's actions are harmful. Racism is a serious issue, and while Will's mental health is a factor, it doesn't justify his behavior. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues or staying in a toxic situation. They have the right to protect their own well-being and choose who they associate with. However, some might argue that they could have tried to help him more before cutting off, but given the repeated and escalating behavior, it seems like they tried to distance themselves before finally deciding to end the friendship. \n\nSo, the author's actions are about self-respect and safety, not abandoning someone. They can't be blamed for prioritizing their values and mental health over a toxic friendship. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
