Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original question) is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will has been a friend since primary school. His racism started with small slurs and escalated to aggressive behavior, including using racial slurs and threatening minorities. At 16, there was an incident where he told two black people to leave the park using a racial slur and said something offensive about their faces. The author tried to distance themselves before but now, after another incident in a group chat, they blocked Will and stopped talking to him.\n\nWill also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The author is conflicted because they care about Will's mental health but can't tolerate his racism anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author is standing up against Will's harmful behavior, which is important for their own mental health and for not condoning racism. Being a victim of Will's racism or witnessing it is traumatic, and the author has the right to protect themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health issues. The author feels guilty about cutting him off because he's alone. But enabling or staying in a friendship where someone is spreading hate might not be the right choice. The author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic relationship, especially if Will's behavior is harmful to others.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried to support Will's mental health while addressing the racism. Maybe they could have sought help for Will instead of cutting off completely. But given the severity of Will's actions, it's understandable that the author felt it was necessary to distance themselves. The author isn't responsible for Will's actions, and it's not their duty to fix his issues. They have the right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a difficult choice to protect themselves and others from racism, even though Will has mental health challenges. The answer would be B.\n"
