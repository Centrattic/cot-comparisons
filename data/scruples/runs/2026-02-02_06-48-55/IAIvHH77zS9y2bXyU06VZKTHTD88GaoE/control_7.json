Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has known Will since primary school, making their friendship long-standing. Will was raised in a racist environment, which influenced his behavior. As they grew older, Will's racist actions escalated from using racial slurs behind people's backs to openly aggressive behavior, like confronting two Black individuals in a park with slurs and telling them to leave. The author was friends with one of the Black individuals, which added to their shock and discomfort. \n\nThen there's the other side: Will is dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. The author is his only friend. The final incident that led to the author cutting off Will was when he targeted someone in a group chat. The author blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school, feeling conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the key points here are the conflict between Will's racist behavior and his mental health struggles. The author is trying to reconcile their own values with their concern for Will's well-being. \n\nIn terms of moral and ethical considerations, racism is a serious issue. It's not just about personal behavior but also the harm it causes to others. The author's decision to distance themselves is a response to Will's harmful actions. However, the author is also acknowledging Will's vulnerabilities, which complicates the situation. The question is whether the author is justified in cutting off a friend who has mental health issues but is also engaging in harmful behavior.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being responsible by setting boundaries. It's possible that Will's racism is a result of his upbringing, but that doesn't excuse it. The author's actions could be seen as protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. On the other hand, the author might feel guilt for abandoning a friend who is struggling, even if that friend's actions are problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of accountability. Should the author continue the friendship in the hopes that Will will change, or is it acceptable to prioritize their own well-being and the well-being of others by cutting off someone who poses a threat? Also, how effective is the author's approach? Blocking and avoiding might not be the best way to help Will with his mental health; maybe seeking professional help would be better, but the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nThe author's actions are a personal choice. They might feel conflicted, but they aren't necessarily in the wrong for protecting themselves from someone who is racist and aggressive. The fact that Will has mental health issues doesn't mitigate his responsibility for his actions. The author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's harmful or toxic, even if the other person is suffering.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to address the issue within the friendship first, perhaps by confronting Will about his behavior or encouraging him to seek help for both his racism and mental health issues. But given that the author is his only friend, maybe they didn't feel equipped to handle both his mental health and his racism, leading to a decision to step away.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to cut off Will is a difficult but understandable response to his harmful behavior, especially considering the escalation over time. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own peace of mind and the safety of others. While it's admirable that they considered Will's mental health, they aren't responsible for his actions or his recovery. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
