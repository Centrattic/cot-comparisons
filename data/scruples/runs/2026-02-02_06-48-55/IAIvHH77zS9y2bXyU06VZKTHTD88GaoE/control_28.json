Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known Will since primary school, so they're close. Will was raised in a racist environment and has exhibited racist behavior over the years, escalating from whispers to public outbursts with slurs. The final straw was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person again. The author then blocked him and avoids him, but feels guilty because Will is depressed, anorexic, self-harms, and the author is his only friend.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The key factors here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's mental health concerns. On one hand, racism is a serious issue; it's harmful and can't be tolerated. The author is protecting themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles, which might make it harder for him to seek help without his friend's support.\n\nBut, just because someone has mental health issues doesn't mean they can't be held accountable for harmful actions. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal boundary to protect their own well-being and others from Will's racism. It's important to note that the author isn't saying Will should be ignored entirely but that they can't continue the friendship as it is. They might still need to consider if there's a way to approach Will about his behavior, but cutting off completely could be justified given the severity of the racism.\n\nAlso, the author isn't responsible for fixing Will's mental health issues. They can't be expected to carry the burden of being the sole support system when Will's actions are harmful. However, the guilt they feel shows they care about Will's well-being, but it's okay to prioritize one's own safety and values.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries against racism. While Will's mental health is a factor, the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship that endangers others. So the answer is B, No.\n"
