Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism. So first, let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person, let's call them the author, has known Will since primary school. Will has been taught racism at home and started showing it as they grew up. By high school, Will's racist behavior became more aggressive, like using racial slurs and targeting minorities. There's a specific incident where Will aggressively told two black people to leave a park, using the n-word and swearing. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and the author is his only friend. The final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person again, leading the author to block him and avoid him. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author made a mistake by cutting off Will. The key factors here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's mental health struggles. The author is in a tough spot because they care about Will's well-being but can't tolerate his behavior anymore.\n\nFirst, let's consider the impact of Will's actions. Using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities is harmful and crosses into hate speech. That's a serious issue. The author might feel that they can't support someone who behaves that way, especially if it's affecting others negatively. But Will has his own issues like depression and self-harm, which makes the situation more complex.\n\nHowever, the author's decision to cut off Will completely after multiple incidents, especially after being his close friend for years, might be seen as a necessary step to protect their own mental health and stand against racism. On the other hand, some might argue that the author could have tried to help Will address his racism instead of cutting him off, given his mental health struggles. But given that Will's behavior is so severe and persistent, the author might not feel responsible for his well-being anymore, especially if they tried to distance themselves before and couldn't handle it anymore.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being inconsiderate by not trying to help Will. But considering the safety and comfort of others, the author has a right to set boundaries. Plus, Will's racism is a choice and a harmful behavior, while his mental health issues are personal struggles. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues, especially if he's an adult making those choices. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions seem justified. They confronted a friend's harmful behavior, tried to distance themselves before, and finally decided to cut ties after a final incident. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing against racism. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
