Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist. The person is concerned because Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and is their only friend. The author blocked Will after he made racist comments in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue. Will's behavior includes using racial slurs, targeting minorities, making offensive remarks, and even aggressive actions. The author tried to handle it by distancing earlier, but after the latest incident, they cut off completely. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health issues. The author feels conflicted because they don't want to abandon him when he's struggling. But standing by a friend who's actively spreading hate and engaging in harmful behavior can be problematic. The author's decision to cut off might be self-preservation or a way to stop enabling harmful behavior, but they're worried about Will's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Choosing between A (yes) or B (no). If the answer is A, it's because maybe the author should have tried to help Will instead of cutting him off. But B would be if cutting off was necessary for their own safety and standing up against racism.\n\nI think the key points are that Will's racism is a choice, and the author is not responsible for fixing his issues. The author has a right to protect themselves and not tolerate hate speech. While Will's mental health is a factor, the author isn't obligated to support harmful behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves to protect their own well-being and values.\n"
