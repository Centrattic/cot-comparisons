Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, considering Will's mental health issues like depression, anorexia, self-harm, and being anxious. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friend has been showing racist behavior that escalated over time, including using racial slurs and aggression towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but decided to cut off contact after a recent incident in a group chat. However, the author is conflicted because Will is struggling mentally and they're his only friend.\n\nSo, the core issue is balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against the potential harm of losing the author's support. On one hand, supporting someone's harmful behavior is problematic, especially when it's racist, which can hurt others. On the other hand, cutting off someone in need of mental health support could leave them isolated.\n\nI should think about whether the author's action was justified. The author tried to distance before but couldn't tolerate it anymore. They might be prioritizing their own boundaries and the well-being of others over their friend's mental health. However, the author's guilt suggests they're internalizing the conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. The author isn't obligated to stay friends with someone who's harmful. However, maybe the author could have found a way to address the racism while still supporting Will's mental health, like confronting him or getting professional help. But the author might not be equipped to handle both issues alone, especially if their friend isn't receptive to change.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to protect themselves and others from racism. The mental health aspect is important, but it doesn't justify harmful behavior. The author might need to find another way to support Will, but cutting off contact isn't necessarily wrong here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
