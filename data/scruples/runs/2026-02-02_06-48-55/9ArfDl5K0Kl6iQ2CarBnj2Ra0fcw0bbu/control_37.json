However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, based on the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. Annie's daughter was in a program that the coworker found concerning. The daughter was underweight and showed signs of being unhealthy after the program. The author called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie boasted about the weight loss, the author made a comment implying that Annie should start the same program, pointing out her own weight. The author feels conflicted about this action.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's comment was justified or if they overstepped. To determine this, I should look at the ethical considerations. The author's motivation was concern for Annie's daughter, which is understandable. However, the method used to address the issue was a direct and public comment about Annie's weight, which could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the actual problem. \n\nWeight-related comments can be sensitive and are often considered a personal matter unless there's a health issue affecting others. The author's comment might have been intended as a form of accountability, but it's possible that it crossed a boundary by targeting Annie's appearance rather than addressing the actions (forcing the daughter into a harmful program). \n\nAlso, the author's action of calling CPS was appropriate. However, the follow-up comment to Annie might not have been the best approach. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, can be counterproductive and unethical. The author might have assumed that Annie needed to lose weight, but that's a personal choice and not directly related to the daughter's situation. The comment could be seen as hypocritical or judgmental, which might make the author in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's behavior\u2014forcing her daughter to diet while not addressing her own weight. However, the approach taken was confrontational and potentially damaging to their work relationship. The right approach might have been to confront Annie privately about the daughter's welfare, not about her weight. \n\nIn summary, while the author's concern for the daughter was valid, the method of addressing Annie's weight in a public and potentially humiliating way was inappropriate. This makes the author at fault for overstepping professional boundaries and making a personal comment that wasn't directly related to the issue of the daughter's well-being.\n"
