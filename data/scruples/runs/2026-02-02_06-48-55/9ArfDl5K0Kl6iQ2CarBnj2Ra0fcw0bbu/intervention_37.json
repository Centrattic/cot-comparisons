However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker Annie to go on a diet, based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet using her tuition money, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and unhealthy. The author, upset by Annie's actions, confronted her by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: Annie's actions toward her daughter are questionable and potentially abusive. The author, concerned about the daughter's well-being, called CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author snapped at Annie by suggesting she join the program. The author is conflicted about their own actions.\n\nThe main ethical dilemma is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, Annie's behavior is harmful, and the author tried to help the daughter. On the other hand, the author addressed the issue indirectly by targeting Annie's weight, which might be seen as personal and possibly cruel.\n\nI need to consider if the author's comment was justified. The author's intention was to hold Annie accountable for her hypocrisy, but using a veiled jab about her weight could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the real issue. Even if the author's motives were good, the method might have been unkind and ineffective. Additionally, the author might have overstepped their role as a coworker, entering a realm that's not their responsibility, and potentially violating privacy or professional boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's action didn't directly address the problem with Annie's parenting. Instead, it focused on Annie's weight, which is a separate issue. This could be seen as shaming her for her own weight rather than addressing her harmful actions toward her daughter. While the author had good intentions, the approach might not have been the best way to handle the situation.\n\nIn summary, even though Annie's actions were wrong, the author's response was a personal attack that might not be justified. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method could be seen as unkind and inappropriate. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
