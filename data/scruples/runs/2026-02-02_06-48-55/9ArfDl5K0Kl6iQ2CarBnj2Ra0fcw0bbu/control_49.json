However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, which led the daughter to become underweight and have health issues. The author, who witnessed this and was upset, made a comment implying that Annie should also go on the same diet. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. The main issue here is that Annie's behavior towards her daughter is definitely harmful. The author was concerned for the daughter's well-being and even contacted CPS, which is a responsible action. However, the author's response of making a sarcastic comment to Annie about joining the program themselves might be seen as crossing a line. While the author's intent was likely to point out the hypocrisy in Annie's behavior, using a public or workplace setting to do so could be considered unprofessional or even bullying. \n\nThe author doesn't directly accuse Annie in front of others, but the implication is there. The comment might have been hurtful or inappropriate, especially in a professional environment. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of addressing the issue might not be the right approach. The daughter's welfare is the main concern, and perhaps the author should have continued to involve appropriate authorities rather than making a personal jab. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comment could be seen as a form of retaliation, which isn't productive. Instead of fostering a solution, it might have caused Annie to become defensive or cut off communication. The author's regret after the comment suggests they realize it wasn't the best approach, but the question is whether they're in the wrong now.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions are clearly harmful, and the author was trying to highlight the inconsistency in her behavior. However, the workplace isn't the best place to address such personal issues. The author might have been within their rights to express concern, but the way they did it might not be appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are problematic because they made a personal comment in a public setting, which could be seen as unprofessional and potentially damaging to their coworker's reputation. The correct approach might have been to continue working with authorities or to address it in a more constructive manner. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
