However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet after witnessing Annie force her daughter into an extreme weight loss program.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's coworker forced her daughter to undergo a strict diet that led to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The author felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should do the same program. The author now feels guilty but also frustrated that Annie didn't address her own weight.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1. The author called out Annie's behavior by suggesting she join the same program, which was previously harmful. 2. The author's intent was to point out the hypocrisy, but the method involved a veiled insult. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. From an ethical standpoint, even if the author had good intentions, they may have crossed a line by making a comment that's personal. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a passive-aggressive remark about someone's body can be seen as bullying. However, the author was reacting to a harmful situation, which complicates things.\n\nBut legally and socially, the act of commenting on someone's weight, especially in a professional setting, is generally not acceptable. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the approach taken by the author could be considered disrespectful. The author should have perhaps reported the situation to the appropriate authorities instead of confronting Annie directly in a manner that could be seen as mocking.\n\nMoreover, the author's comment might not have been effective in addressing the real issue, which was the harm done to the daughter. The author's personal frustration about Annie's weight isn't the same as the daughter's health crisis. So, while Annie's actions were wrong, the author's response might have been unprofessional and potentially harmful in itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
