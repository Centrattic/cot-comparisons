However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program, and the author, upset about this, made a veiled comment suggesting Annie should do the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. By forcing her daughter into a restrictive diet that led to health issues and financial loss, Annie is clearly overstepping. The author, upon witnessing this, felt compelled to take action. But the method they chose\u2014using a subtle jab about Annie's own weight\u2014might be problematic.\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy, but the approach involved body-shaming, even if indirectly. Even without directly calling Annie out on her weight, the implication is there. This could be seen as a form of bullying or public shaming, which isn't an appropriate way to address someone's behavior, especially when it's related to a sensitive issue like health and family dynamics.\n\nHowever, the situation with Annie's daughter is serious. The author did report to CPS, which was a responsible step. The comment was made after that, perhaps out of frustration. The question is whether the author's comment crossed a line. While the intention might have been to encourage Annie to reflect on her actions, using her own weight as a weapon could be seen as attacking the person rather than addressing the behavior. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing the harm done to the daughter, would have been better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had a direct way to confront Annie about her daughter without overstepping their role. But making a comment that implies Annie should also diet, given her own weight, even if it's a reaction to her harmful actions, still targets Annie's body and could be seen as discriminatory. Weight-based comments can be hurtful and might not lead to the desired change in behavior. It's possible that the author's action, while driven by concern, was not the most effective or ethical way to handle the situation.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they resorted to body-shaming despite the serious issue. However, there's nuance because the underlying issue with Annie's treatment of her daughter is a valid concern. But the method used by the author is problematic. Therefore, the author's action is in the wrong.\n"
