However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who made the comment) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, especially after witnessing Annie force her daughter into an extreme diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Annie's actions toward her daughter are concerning. She used her daughter's college funds for a weight loss program, which resulted in the daughter becoming severely underweight. The author reported this to CPS, which is a responsible action. However, the author then confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight herself, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's comment was justified. On one hand, the author was concerned about the daughter's well-being and tried to help by reporting the situation. On the other hand, the author's comment about Annie's weight could be seen as a personal attack, even if it was meant to call out hypocrisy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's intentions might have been to address Annie's harmful behavior, using a backhanded comment about her weight might not be the most appropriate response. It could be considered cruel or offensive, especially since weight is a sensitive topic. The author did report the issue formally, which is the right step, but the personal comment could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation was based on anger and frustration, which might have led to an impulsive reaction rather than a constructive conversation. The question is whether the author's comment was a valid response to Annie's actions. Even if the author felt it was justified, the method of addressing it by targeting Annie's weight without direct evidence of her needing to lose it (other than implied hypocrisy) might be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's comment was likely an overreaction and not the appropriate way to address the situation. The right approach would have been to continue focusing on the daughter's well-being through proper channels rather than making a personal remark about Annie's weight. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the comment was mean-spirited and not the best approach, even if motivated by concern.\n"
