However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation where the coworker forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, made her daughter participate in a program that involved significant weight loss, using her college funds. The daughter became underweight and was harmed. The author, upon learning this, confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program, leading to Annie's silence and the daughter's absence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful program but didn't do the same for herself. The author was concerned about the daughter's well-being and tried to address the issue by calling out Annie's actions indirectly.\n\n2. However, the method used was indirect and could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author made a comment implying that Annie should follow the same program, which might be considered a personal attack on her weight rather than addressing the real issue of the daughter's treatment.\n\n3. The daughter's situation is a serious matter. The author did take action by contacting CPS, which is appropriate. But after that, the author resorted to a comment that could be seen as shaming Annie, which might not be the most effective way to address the problem and could have worsened the situation.\n\n4. The author expresses regret, indicating they might see the issue with their approach. However, the intent was to correct Annie's behavior, but the method was a personal jab rather than a direct confrontation of the harmful actions towards the daughter.\n\nIn ethical terms, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, the way they addressed it by focusing on Annie's weight might be seen as inappropriate. Addressing the parent's own health might not be the right approach when the main issue is the harm done to the child. The author could have instead focused on the daughter's well-being without using a personal attack. Thus, the author's method was flawed, making them at least partially at fault. However, the underlying concern is valid. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the specific action of making the comment. Given that the comment was a passive-aggressive jab rather than a direct, respectful confrontation, and considering that it might have been a way to highlight hypocrisy but in a harmful manner, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong). However, if the context of the author trying to address a serious issue is considered, some might argue it's not the author's fault. But given the personal nature of the comment and the potential harm in shaming someone, A might be the correct answer.\n"
