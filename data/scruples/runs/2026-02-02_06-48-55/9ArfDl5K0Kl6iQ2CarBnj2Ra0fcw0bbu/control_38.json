However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo a strict weight loss program, which led the daughter to become underweight and unhealthy. The author, feeling angry about this, made a comment implying that Annie should try the same program herself, which was a veiled jab at her weight. Now the author is questioning whether they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning and potentially harmful. The author felt compelled to act after reporting to CPS didn't result in any action. On the other hand, the author's comment was a direct jab at Annie's weight without addressing the actual issue through proper channels. \n\nI should consider the ethical implications. While the author is upset about Annie's treatment of her daughter, making a personal comment about Annie's weight might not be the right approach. The author could have tried to support the daughter more directly or involve other authorities if CPS didn't act. Using a public comment to shame Annie could be seen as a harsh response, even if motivated by concern. \n\nAdditionally, the comment might be considered bullying or retaliatory. The author's action, while perhaps intended to call out hypocrisy, might not be the most constructive way to address the situation. It's possible that the author's comment could have done more harm, damaging workplace relationships or not addressing the root problem effectively.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the author was trying to address a harmful situation they observed. Their intentions might be to encourage Annie to reflect on her actions, but the method used was indirect and potentially hurtful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was a personal attack, even if it was in response to something worse. The appropriate approach would have been to support the daughter further, perhaps through counseling or other resources, rather than making a snide remark about the mother's weight. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their method of response, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
