However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker's harmful actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on an extreme diet that led to the daughter being underweight and injured. The author, who witnessed this, called Child Protective Services when concerned. Later, when Annie boasted about the results, the author responded sarcastically, implying Annie should do the same diet. Annie then stopped talking to the author, and the author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's intent was to confront Annie's harmful behavior, 2) The method used was a sarcastic comment that didn't directly accuse but implied a jab, 3) The author had prior concerns and took action by contacting CPS, and 4) Annie didn't change her behavior, and the daughter's condition worsened.\n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace conduct, the author's comment, while not directly confrontational, could be seen as unprofessional or crossing into personal matters. However, the author's motivation was rooted in concern for the daughter's well-being. The comment might be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than an effective intervention. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions were clearly harmful, but the author's response might not be the most appropriate way to address it, especially in a professional setting. The author might have been better off discussing the issue with management or HR, or continuing to support the daughter without targeting Annie's weight publicly.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is in a morally complex position. While the coworker's actions were wrong, the author's method of response might not be the most appropriate, especially in a workplace context. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not handling it more professionally.\n"
