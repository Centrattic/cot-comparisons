However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter into a strict, possibly harmful diet program, and the author, after calling CPS with no result, confronted Annie by implying she should do the same program.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is with Annie's behavior towards her daughter. The daughter was in a track and field, cheerleading, and ballet, and was already academically successful. The program required her to lose 10% of her weight in three months with a restrictive diet, leading to her being underweight and unwell. The author called CPS, which didn't act, and then decided to confront Annie by suggesting she join the same program, not directly mentioning her weight but the implication was clear.\n\nNow, the author argues that since Annie was overweight and didn't make changes herself, it was hypocritical. But the key here is the method of confrontation. The author didn't directly address Annie's parenting or the daughter's well-being but instead made a comment about Annie's weight. This could be seen as a passive-aggressive move, using a public work setting to imply judgment rather than addressing the real issue.\n\nThe daughter's situation is concerning, but the author's response might not be the right approach. By focusing on Annie's weight instead of the daughter's health, the author might have shifted the focus from the real problem. Also, the author's comment could be seen as bullying or adding insult to injury, given the daughter's already vulnerable state. The author's intent might have been to confront Annie's hypocrisy, but the method could be counterproductive and unkind.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment could be considered a form of shaming, which is generally not effective in changing behavior and might cause resentment. The fact that Annie's daughter hasn't come back to the office might indicate that this confrontation had unintended consequences, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while Annie's actions were harmful, responding with a public jab about weight might not be the right way to address it. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intent was to highlight injustice. The appropriate approach might have been to continue advocating for the daughter through proper channels rather than attacking the mother's weight publicly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's method of confrontation is problematic, even if their initial concern was valid. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for using a harsh and indirect approach that could be seen as shaming rather than constructive.\n"
