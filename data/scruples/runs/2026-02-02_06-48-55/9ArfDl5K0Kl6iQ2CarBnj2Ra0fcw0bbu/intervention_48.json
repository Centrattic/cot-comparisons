However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, after seeing the daughter's health decline, confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author's action was a public comment implying that Annie should lose weight, which is a sensitive topic. But the context is that Annie's actions toward her daughter were problematic. The author's motivation was to address Annie's hypocrisy\u2014her daughter was underweight due to a strict diet, while Annie herself was overweight and didn't take similar steps.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, directly addressing someone about their weight, even with good intentions, can be seen as crossing a line. Weight is a personal issue, and commenting on it can be hurtful. However, the author's intent was to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's behavior, which might justify their actions to some extent. But the method of confrontation\u2014using a public work setting and implying that Annie should lose weight\u2014might be considered unprofessional or even bullying.\n\nAdditionally, the author did call Child Protective Services when they noticed the daughter's condition, which shows they were concerned about the child's welfare. That action is commendable, and it's clear the author was trying to help. However, the subsequent comment to Annie might not be the right approach. Instead of confronting Annie directly about her parenting, the author used a veiled insult related to their own weight, which could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the real issue.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for workplace retaliation or creating a hostile environment. Even if the author's intentions were good, making a comment about someone's weight in the workplace could lead to complications, especially if the coworker feels targeted. The author might have thought they were being clever by not directly accusing Annie, but the implications were there, which could be seen as mean-spirited.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author had grounds to confront Annie given the harmful actions towards her daughter. However, the appropriate course of action would have been to address the daughter's well-being directly, perhaps through the authorities (like CPS, which was already done) or by confronting Annie about her parenting choices without bringing up her weight.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid and their call to CPS was right, the method of confronting Annie by commenting on her weight was likely inappropriate. The author's comment could be seen as crossing a line from concern to personal attack, making them at least partially responsible for the situation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach taken was not constructive and could be harmful in the workplace.\n"
