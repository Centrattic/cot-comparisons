However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker Annie to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter going through a strict diet program under her mother's direction, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and having health issues. The author, upset about this, confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program, which they regret but also feel justified because Annie didn't follow her own advice.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The author's coworker, Annie, is making her daughter go through a harmful diet, which is a serious issue. The author is concerned about the daughter's health and even contacted CPS, which might have been a responsible step. However, the author then decided to confront Annie in a public setting (the office) by making a sarcastic comment suggesting Annie should also do the program. \n\nThe key points here are: \n\n1. The author's intention was to call out Annie for hypocrisy (her daughter dieting while Annie is overweight). \n2. The method used was a passive-aggressive comment that implied a criticism without directly stating it. \n3. The author's action was a response to witnessing a parent's potentially harmful behavior towards their child.\n\nOn one hand, the author is addressing a serious issue where a parent is forcing their child into an unhealthy diet. The author's concern is valid and shows they care about the daughter's well-being. However, the way they chose to address it\u2014publicly and indirectly\u2014might not be the most effective or appropriate method. \n\nPublic shaming or indirect confrontation can lead to defensiveness and might not encourage the desired change in behavior. Annie might not have taken the comment seriously, as she just laughed it off. Moreover, the author is projecting their own frustration onto Annie, which might not be constructive. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about Annie's weight could be seen as personal and potentially hurtful. While the intention was to highlight hypocrisy, it's still a sensitive topic, and making someone the target of a passive-aggressive comment isn't a respectful way to address the issue. \n\nThere's also the aspect of workplace dynamics. Making snide remarks about a coworker's weight, even if motivated by concern about their parenting, can create a hostile work environment. It's important to address issues in ways that are professional and considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the daughter's health is legitimate. If the company's policies allowed for a certain response, like the author calling CPS, then that was appropriate. However, the follow-up action was to make a comment that might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's intent was to correct a harmful action, but the method chosen might not align with ethical communication. Ethical behavior often involves direct, respectful communication aimed at solving the problem, not just highlighting hypocrisy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because their approach was not constructive and involved making a personal comment about someone's weight in a public setting. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the method used was inappropriate.\n"
