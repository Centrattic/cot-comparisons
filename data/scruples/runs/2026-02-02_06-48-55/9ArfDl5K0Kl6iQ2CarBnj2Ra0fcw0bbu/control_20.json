However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their coworker, Annie, about her actions towards her daughter and then implying that Annie should also go on the same diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Annie forced her daughter into a restrictive diet, leading to the daughter losing a significant amount of weight and becoming underweight. The author, concerned, reported this to CPS but was ignored. Then, the author made a comment to Annie suggesting she should also start the diet, using the daughter's situation as an example. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to do so.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Annie's actions are clearly harmful. Coercing a daughter into an extreme diet that leads to health issues is abusive. The author's intent was to expose Annie's hypocrisy and possibly deter her from continuing such behavior. However, the method used was indirect\u2014hinting rather than directly confronting. The author didn't explicitly accuse Annie of being overweight but made the implication through the context of the daughter's program.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author acted out of concern for the daughter's wellbeing. The comment was made to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's actions. However, even with good intentions, publicly implying that someone should lose weight can be seen as body-shaming, which is generally considered rude. The author might have crossed a line by using a sensitive topic to make a point, even if the underlying issue is serious.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's actions were a response to observing harm. The comment was a form of passive-aggressive confrontation, which might not be the most effective, but it was a reaction to a concerning situation. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the severity of Annie's behavior. Since the CPS didn't act, the author felt compelled to take some form of action, albeit not the best one.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is more in the right in trying to address the harmful behavior, even if the method was flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the comment was a form of retaliation and not a direct confrontation, it's a gray area. The main issue is the author's intent versus the action. The action was harsh but stemmed from a place of trying to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author acted from concern over a serious issue, even if the approach was suboptimal. The real wrong here is on Annie's side for the harmful actions towards her daughter.\n"
