However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the story provided. \n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo an extreme dieting program, which led the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, upon learning about this, decided to confront Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight. The author is now asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable and potentially harmful. The author's response was to make a comment that indirectly criticized Annie's weight. The question is whether the author's action was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using the daughter's situation as a reason to target the mother's weight might be seen as hypocritical. The author is addressing an issue they care about (Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter), but their method involved body-shaming the mother. While the intention might be to highlight the inconsistency, the method could be considered cruel or inappropriate. \n\nLegally, there's no clear violation unless the comment was part of harassment. However, ethically, the author's comment could be seen as crossing a line. The daughter's situation was already dealt with by calling CPS, which the author did. The author's frustration is understandable, but attacking the mother's weight in this context might not address the underlying issues and could be seen as hypocritical or bullying.\n\nThe author might have better addressed the situation by discussing it with Annie directly in a non-judgmental way, or reporting to appropriate authorities if CPS wasn't effective. Instead, using a backhanded comment that targets the mother's weight could be seen as in the wrong, as it shifts the focus from the daughter's treatment to the mother's appearance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, was likely in the wrong because it involved body-shaming and didn't constructively address the original issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
