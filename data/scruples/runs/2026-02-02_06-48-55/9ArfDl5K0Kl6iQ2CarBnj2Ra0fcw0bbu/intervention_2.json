However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet that's probably harmful, and the author responded by suggesting Annie join the same program, which implies a criticism about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's main issue is with Annie forcing her daughter into a diet that led to health issues. The author tried to intervene by calling CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's success, the author made a comment implying that Annie should also do the program, which is a passive-aggressive way of pointing out that Annie is overweight.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the author was trying to address the harmful behavior of Annie towards her daughter. The author's intentions might be good, wanting to stop the unhealthy diet. But the method used was a public jab at Annie's weight, which is a personal and sensitive issue. Even though the author didn't explicitly say Annie is fat, the implication is there. This could be seen as cruel or bullying, especially since weight is a touchy subject. The author might have thought it would shame Annie into changing, but instead, it might have made her withdraw or feel attacked.\n\nAlso, the author's comment might not have been effective. Annie didn't respond, and her daughter hasn't come back. Maybe the author's approach created a hostile environment. Even if the author had good intentions, the method used could be considered unprofessional or crossing a line in a workplace setting. The author could have instead tried to approach Annie directly about their concerns for the daughter's health, perhaps with more support or through proper channels, rather than using a backhanded comment in public.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the comment was a personal attack, even if it was intended to highlight a problem. It's possible that a more constructive approach would have been better. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
