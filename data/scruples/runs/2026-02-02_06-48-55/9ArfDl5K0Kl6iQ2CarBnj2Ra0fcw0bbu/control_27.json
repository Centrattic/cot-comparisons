However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter to participate in a dangerous weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author, upset by Annie's actions, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should start the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to confront Annie about her harmful behavior towards her daughter by using a passive-aggressive approach. The comment was indirect but clearly implied criticism. The question is whether this response was justified or if it crosses the line into bullying or harassment.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly concerning. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet with financial stakes and leading to health issues is problematic. However, the author's response was to make a sarcastic suggestion. While the author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy, the method used could be seen as unprofessional or cruel, even if the underlying issue is serious.\n\nIn a workplace setting, addressing such matters should ideally involve proper channels, like HR or contacting authorities if there's suspicion of child abuse. The author did contact CPS, which is appropriate. However, making the sarcastic comment in the workplace might escalate tensions and could be considered unprofessional, especially if it's seen as mocking someone's body. Weight-related comments can be sensitive and often touch on body shaming issues, which are generally discouraged.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's behavior. The comment was a form of passive resistance to draw attention to the problem. While the approach might be unorthodox, the underlying concern is valid. However, the method could be seen as inappropriate, as it's indirect and could be hurtful.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) The severity of Annie's actions, 2) The appropriateness of the author's response in a professional setting, and 3) Whether the author overstepped in addressing the issue. \n\nAnnie's actions are harmful and potentially illegal, so the author had a valid reason to be upset. However, responding with a sarcastic remark in the workplace may not be the best approach. It's possible that this could be seen as unprofessional or even discriminatory, depending on the context. \n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, even if the concern is valid, the method of addressing it should be constructive and within professional boundaries. The author might be in the wrong for not using more appropriate channels or for contributing to a hostile work environment, even if their intent was to help. However, given the serious nature of Annie's actions, some might argue that the author's response, while unprofessional, was a reaction to a serious issue.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because the comment was unprofessional and could be seen as bullying, even though the underlying issue is serious. However, others might argue that the author's intent was to expose harmful behavior, but the method was inappropriate. The balance here tilts towards A because the comment could be considered a form of harassment or unprofessional conduct, regardless of intent.\n"
