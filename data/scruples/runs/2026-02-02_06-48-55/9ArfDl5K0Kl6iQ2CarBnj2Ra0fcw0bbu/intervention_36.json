However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict weight loss program that seems harmful. The author found out about this, called CPS, which didn't result in action, and then decided to confront Annie by suggesting she should also go on the same program. Now the author is wondering if they're the a**hole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They did something that could be seen as confrontational, using a passive-aggressive comment to imply that Annie should lose weight. But why did they do it? Because they were upset about Annie's treatment of her daughter. The author felt compelled to act because they were concerned about the daughter's well-being and wanted to hold Annie accountable. However, instead of addressing the situation directly with Annie or involving more appropriate authorities (like maybe child protective services again or talking to a supervisor if that's relevant), the author chose to make a public comment that could be seen as shaming Annie about her weight.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, Annie's actions towards her daughter are indeed concerning and potentially abusive. The author was trying to highlight the double standard by pointing out that if the program worked for the daughter, it should work for Annie. But the method of doing so\u2014by making a comment that implies judgment about Annie's own weight\u2014might not be the right approach. Weight shaming is generally not an effective or ethical way to address someone's behavior, even if their behavior is harmful. It can lead to defensiveness and might not actually help the daughter's situation.\n\nThe author's intention was to help the daughter by making Annie aware of her own hypocrisy, but the approach could be counterproductive. Instead of addressing the root issue (Annie's harmful actions towards her daughter), the comment focuses on Annie's weight, which is a separate issue. The author might have hoped that by pointing out the inconsistency, Annie would stop pressuring her daughter, but this is speculative. Also, the author's comment could be seen as a personal attack rather than a constructive intervention.\n\nAnother angle is the author's right to intervene. They did take action by calling CPS, which was probably appropriate. But when that didn't result in action, the author decided on their own to make a comment. However, the workplace isn't necessarily the right place to address personal issues like this, and the author's comment could affect their professional relationship with Annie. Additionally, the comment might not have been necessary if the author had instead focused on advocating for the daughter in other ways, like documenting the situation or seeking help from other authorities or support groups.\n\nIn terms of ethics, shaming someone's weight is generally discouraged because it can contribute to negative health outcomes and doesn't address the underlying issues. The author's intent was to help the daughter, but the method was flawed. The comment might have been a knee-jerk reaction driven by anger rather than a well-considered strategy to help the daughter.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because they resorted to weight shaming as a form of intervention, which is not an appropriate or effective way to address the situation. They should have found a more constructive way to support the daughter and hold Annie accountable without attacking her weight. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
