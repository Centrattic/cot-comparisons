However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is at fault for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker's actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and facing financial issues. The author, after witnessing this and reporting to CPS without success, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should join the same program. The author did not directly address Annie's weight but used the situation to point out the hypocrisy.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent and the nature of the comment. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, who is overweight but made her daughter go on an extreme diet. The comment was passive-aggressive but didn't directly insult Annie's weight. However, using someone's health issues as a jab, even if well-intentioned, can be seen as crossing a line, especially in a workplace. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Annie to address her own weight, but it's a sensitive topic and could be viewed as unprofessional or harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions are clearly concerning and possibly abusive. The author acted out of concern for the daughter's welfare. However, the method used\u2014mocking Annie's weight indirectly\u2014might not be the best approach. The author's comment could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive response, even if it was in response to a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the situation involves a serious problem with Annie's parenting, the author's response might not be the most appropriate. Workplace interactions should ideally be professional, and making passive remarks about someone's body weight, even as a form of criticism, can be problematic. The author might have better addressed the issue by supporting the daughter or reporting through proper channels instead of confronting Annie in a public, indirect way.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than a direct intervention. While the underlying issue with Annie is serious, the author's method of addressing it may be unwise, making them at least partially in the wrong. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
