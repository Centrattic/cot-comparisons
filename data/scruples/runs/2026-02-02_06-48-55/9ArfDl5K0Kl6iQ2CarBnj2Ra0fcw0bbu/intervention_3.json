However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on the same diet program Annie made her daughter do. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Annie forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program that led the daughter to become underweight and take out loans. The author, after witnessing this, confronts Annie by implying she should join the same program, using the daughter's success as a reason. The author is frustrated because Annie didn't change her own habits despite being overweight.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method used. The author wanted to address Annie's behavior towards her daughter by holding her accountable. However, the approach was indirect\u2014using a comment that implies criticism without directly accusing Annie of wrongdoing. The author's comment was a passive-aggressive jab, which might not be the best way to handle such a serious issue.\n\nLegally and ethically, the main concern is whether the author overstepped by making a personal comment about Annie's weight. Since the author didn't make a direct accusation or report the situation through proper channels, but instead used a sarcastic remark, it's a public shaming of sorts. However, the situation involves a minor's well-being, so there's a societal expectation to intervene when a child is harmed.\n\nBut the author did take action by contacting CPS, which didn't result in anything. So the author tried to help through official means. However, since CPS didn't act, the author felt compelled to take another approach. The comment was made in a professional setting (work), which could affect workplace dynamics.\n\nThe author's comment didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used the daughter's situation to imply that Annie should also diet. This could be seen as hypocritical if Annie didn't follow the same program, but the author's comment was a form of social pressure rather than a direct confrontation.\n\nThe question is whether the author's method was appropriate. Publicly shaming someone in the workplace about their weight, even if motivated by a desire to address harmful behavior, is generally considered inappropriate. Weight is a sensitive topic, and such comments can be seen as bullying or harassment, especially in a workplace setting. The author might have intended to highlight the hypocrisy but crossed a line into personal criticism.\n\nHowever, the author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter. The comment was a way to bring attention to that issue by using a personal jab. The problem is that the comment was about Annie's appearance rather than addressing the daughter's situation directly. The author might have felt that indirect methods were necessary due to previous inaction by authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter's well-being is valid, the method of confronting Annie through a public, passive-aggressive comment in the workplace is inappropriate and unprofessional. The author should have addressed the issue through other channels rather than making a personal remark about Annie's weight. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
