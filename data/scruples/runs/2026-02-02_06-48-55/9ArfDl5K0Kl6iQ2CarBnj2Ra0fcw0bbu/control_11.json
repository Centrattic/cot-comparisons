However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is upset about their coworker Annie forcing her daughter to go on an extreme diet. The daughter ended up underweight, injured herself, and lost money for college. The author, in response, told Annie she should try the same diet, implying she's overweight. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author saw a family member being harmed and took action by reporting to CPS, which is the right thing. But then, instead of directly confronting Annie about her actions or maybe talking to the girl privately, they made a snide comment in front of others. That's where the problem might lie. The comment implies that Annie is the one who should lose weight, which could be seen as body-shaming. Even if the intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, using such a comment might not be the appropriate way to address it.\n\nAlso, the author is projecting their own judgment onto Annie. Just because Annie is overweight doesn't mean that's the root issue. The main problem here is the mother pushing her daughter into an unhealthy diet, which is a form of neglect. The author's comment doesn't address the underlying issue but instead points to their own bias about weight. It's possible that the author is trying to make a point about hypocrisy, but the method they chose could be seen as unprofessional and harmful, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nMoreover, the author admitted to regretting the comment. That suggests they realize it might have been unwise, even if their anger was justified. The line between standing up for someone and engaging in personal attacks can be thin. In this case, the author might have crossed it by making a jab about Annie's weight instead of focusing on the daughter's well-being through more constructive means.\n\nHowever, another angle is that the author was trying to point out the hypocrisy in a roundabout way. They might not have felt equipped to handle the situation directly or feared backlash for speaking up about a family matter. Still, the impact of their comment could hurt Annie and might not have resolved the daughter's issues. \n\nIn professional settings, discussing someone's weight is generally considered inappropriate and can be discriminatory. The author's comment, even if made in good faith, could create a hostile work environment. It's important to address issues like child neglect through proper channels, not through personal remarks that could be seen as bullying or judgmental.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because their response was inappropriate and unprofessional, even if their initial concern was valid. The right approach would have been to continue supporting the daughter through appropriate means without making personal attacks on Annie's weight.\n"
