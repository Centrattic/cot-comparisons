However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker, Annie, who made her daughter go on an extreme diet. The author found out about this and was upset, so when Annie started talking about her daughter's success, the author made a comment implying that Annie should also do the program. Now the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Annie is an adult, but using her daughter's savings for a diet that sounds harmful is concerning. The daughter is underweight and injured, so that's a red flag. The author called CPS, which is a responsible step, but the system didn't act. Then the author decided to confront Annie by making a backhanded comment.\n\nNow, the author's action: they told Annie to go on the same diet, implying she's overweight. The author says they didn't mention her weight directly, but the implication was there. Is that right? Well, even though Annie's actions were bad, making a passive-aggressive comment might not be the best approach. The author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her hypocrisy, but public shaming or implied criticism could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the daughter is a minor, so Annie's actions could be considered abuse. The author's main issue is that Annie didn't make changes for herself. But the author's method of addressing it by making a comment that's a bit mean might be inappropriate. Even if the message is correct, the delivery matters. The author might have regretted it, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for doing it.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to help by highlighting the hypocrisy. On the other hand, they could have approached it more directly or privately, rather than using a snarky comment. Also, Annie is an adult, so the author's comment about her weight might be seen as personal and unkind, even if the underlying issue is serious.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention was to address a problem, but the method used was possibly unprofessional and hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the situation with Annie's daughter was wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
