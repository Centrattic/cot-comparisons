However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter into a strict dieting program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and potentially harmful. The author, upset about this, made a comment to Annie implying she should do the same diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter. By making a public comment that implies Annie should diet because she's overweight, the author is using a form of passive-aggressive confrontation. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problematic situation where a parent is harming their child. However, the author's approach might not be the best. Directly confronting someone about their weight in a public setting without their consent could be seen as invasive and disrespectful, regardless of the intent. It's possible that the comment was meant to make Annie reflect on her actions, but using another person's weight as leverage for moral judgment is a sensitive issue.\n\nAlso, the author called CPS when they noticed the daughter's condition, which shows they were trying to help. But after that, the approach shifted to a personal comment. The author might have felt that since Annie didn't change her behavior after the CPS intervention, a more direct approach was needed. However, public shaming or implying that someone should diet because of their weight can be harmful and counterproductive. It might not effectively address the root issue, which is Annie's control over her daughter's health.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own justification. They mention regret, indicating that they recognize the comment might have been harsh. The question is whether the comment was an appropriate response. Since the author's primary concern was the daughter's well-being and Annie's actions, the method used might not be the most ethical or effective. The comment could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if well-intentioned.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is not in the wrong solely for making the comment, but the comment itself is problematic. The real issue here is Annie's actions towards her daughter. However, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. The correct approach would have been to continue working through proper channels, like involving authorities again if necessary, rather than making a personal jab.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was inappropriate and likely made things worse. They should have handled the situation through more constructive means. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
