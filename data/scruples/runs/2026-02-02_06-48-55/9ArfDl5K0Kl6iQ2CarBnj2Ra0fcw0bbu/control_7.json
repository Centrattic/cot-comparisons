However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter into a strict weight loss program, which led the daughter to become severely underweight and harm herself. The author, upset by this, made a comment implying that Annie should try the same program, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning; forcing a diet on a teenager, especially one involved in sports and academics, could be abusive. The author's reaction was to call out Annie, using the same program on her. But the comment was indirect, not directly addressing Annie's weight but implying she should do it.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method. The author was motivated by concern for the daughter, which is commendable, but the approach might be problematic. Directly confronting the issue with authority figures or legal channels (like CPS) was done, but the author took a different route by making a snide remark. This could be seen as passive-aggressive rather than constructive. However, considering the coworker relationship, the author might not have the authority to address it directly.\n\nLegally, the author didn't do anything illegal, but ethically, there's a debate. The comment could be considered bullying or passive-aggressive, but it might be a justified reaction to a harmful situation. The author's comment didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used the same program as a suggestion. However, the implications could be hurtful, even if not malicious.\n\nAnnie's behavior is the root issue here. The author's comment might have been a way to express frustration without being overtly confrontational. But in a workplace, such comments can create a hostile environment. The author's action is a form of passive retaliation, which might not be the best approach, but given the context of a harmful situation, it's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's comment was a reaction to witnessing potential abuse. While the method may not be ideal, the underlying concern is valid. However, the right approach would have been to involve proper channels rather than workplace shaming. The author's regret suggests they realize this might not have been the best way to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intent was to address a harmful situation, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue B, not in the wrong, given the context. However, the comment was a personal jab and not a constructive solution, making A the more likely answer.\n"
