However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker Annie to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter, who was already healthy, into an extreme dieting program. The coworker called Child Protective Services because they were concerned about the daughter's health. Then, when Annie bragged about the daughter's weight loss, the coworker implied that Annie should join the same program, leading to a backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coworker saw a parent harming their child and took action by contacting CPS, which is a responsible step. However, the coworker then made a comment implying that Annie should also diet, which is more about body shaming. The question is whether that comment crosses a line.\n\nOn one hand, the coworker was motivated by past actions where Annie forced her daughter into an unhealthy diet. The coworker might feel justified in pointing out the hypocrisy. But on the other hand, commenting on someone's weight without addressing the actual issue (Annie's treatment of her daughter) could be seen as inappropriate. The comment might be a form of shaming rather than addressing the real problem, which was already handled by CPS.\n\nAlso, the coworker's comment could have been unprofessional and potentially contributed to a hostile work environment. Even if the intention was to highlight hypocrisy, the method might not be suitable. The coworker already took the right step by reporting to CPS; the comment might not be necessary and could be seen as crossing a boundary by focusing on the mother's weight instead of the daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, while the coworker's concern for the daughter was valid and their action to call CPS was right, the subsequent comment to Annie about joining the diet program is likely unprofessional and could be seen as body shaming. Therefore, the coworker might be in the wrong for that specific action.\n"
