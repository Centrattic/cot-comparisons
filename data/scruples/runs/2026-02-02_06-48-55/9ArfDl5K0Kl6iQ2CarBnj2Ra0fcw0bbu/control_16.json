However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a harmful weight loss program, leading to the daughter becoming severely underweight. The author, after calling Child Protective Services (CPS) with no action taken, snaps at Annie during a work conversation, implying she should join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. She took her daughter's money, forced her into a restrictive program, and the daughter is now underweight and injured. The author's concern is valid, but their response is a public jab at Annie's weight. The question is whether this response is justified or if it's an overstep.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's intention was to address Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter, 2) The method used was a veiled comment implying the same diet should apply to Annie, 3) The author feels regret but is also angry about Annie's hypocrisy.\n\nLegally, the author called CPS, which is the right step. However, their personal response might be problematic. Publicly shaming someone, even if the person has done wrong, can be seen as inappropriate. The author's comment could be considered a form of harassment or bullying, especially in a workplace setting. The comment might also be discriminatory if it's based on weight, which is a protected category in some places. However, the comment was in response to a parent endangering their child, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the author had a right to be concerned about the child's welfare, but the way they expressed their concern could have been more constructive. The comment was passive-aggressive and could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if motivated by good intentions. The fact that Annie hasn't spoken to the author since might indicate that the comment damaged their relationship unjustly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for being concerned about the child's welfare, but the method of addressing Annie's behavior was inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to continue working through proper channels (like involving authorities again) rather than making a personal jab. The author's action could be seen as adding insult to injury, using Annie's personal appearance as a weapon, which is not a professional or ethical response.\n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the method used to address the issue was improper, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
