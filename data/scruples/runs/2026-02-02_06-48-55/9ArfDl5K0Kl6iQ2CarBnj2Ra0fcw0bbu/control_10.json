However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling their coworker to go on a diet. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a harmful diet using her college funds, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author, after seeing this, confronts Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. Forcing a daughter into a program that causes health issues and uses her college money is concerning. The author felt compelled to act, even though their method might be indirect. The author's comment was meant to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie not changing her own habits despite making her daughter do so.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Direct confrontation might be better, but the author's approach was to use a subtle jab. However, making a comment about someone's weight, even if it's to highlight a problem, can be seen as inappropriate. The author's intention was good (trying to help the daughter), but the method might have been unprofessional and potentially offensive. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author might have overstepped by implying Annie needed to lose weight without addressing the real issue through proper channels. The author's actions could be seen as bullying or harassment, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the intent was to help, the approach was not constructive and might have violated workplace policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to address a harmful situation. However, the solution should have been to report the issue to authorities or management rather than making a personal comment. The author's action might have caused Annie to stop mentioning the program, but it doesn't resolve the underlying problem and could have made Annie defensive.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. The author should have reported the issue to the appropriate authorities instead of making a snide remark. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
