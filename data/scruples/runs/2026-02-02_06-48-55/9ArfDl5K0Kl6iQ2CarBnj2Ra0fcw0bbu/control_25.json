However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves the author confronting their overweight coworker, Annie, about her forcing her daughter into a restrictive diet program. The coworker's daughter ended up underweight, and the author called out Annie by implying she should also start the program. Now, the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the facts. Annie's actions toward her daughter are clearly problematic. She took her daughter's money, forced her into a program that led to weight loss and health issues. The author stepped in by calling Annie out, but in a passive-aggressive way by suggesting she join the program herself. The key points here are the child's well-being and the author's response.\n\nOn one hand, the author was concerned about the daughter's health and took action by contacting CPS, which is appropriate. However, when they decided to confront Annie, they did it by making a veiled comment that implied Annie needed to lose weight. This could be seen as addressing a real issue (Annie's behavior towards her daughter) but in a way that uses a personal attack on Annie's weight. \n\nThe problem here is whether the author had the right to make that comment. While the intent was to call out Annie's hypocrisy (forcing her daughter to diet while not doing so herself), the method involved body-shaming. Body-shaming is generally considered inappropriate because it can be harmful and stigmatizing. Even if the author's intention was to highlight Annie's abusive behavior, using personal weight as a weapon can backfire and may not be the most effective way to address the issue. Additionally, the author might have a responsibility to address the situation through proper channels rather than personal confrontation. \n\nHowever, the author's concern about the daughter's well-being was valid, and they did act (by calling CPS). The comment might have been an emotional reaction rather than a well-thought-out approach. The key is whether the author's action was justified given the circumstances. Since the daughter's health was at risk, the author had a reason to be upset, but the method of confrontation could be seen as crossing a line into personal criticism that's not constructive. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's comment might have been a mistake because it focused on Annie's weight rather than the actual harmful behavior. Instead of directly addressing the issue of the daughter's treatment, the author used a personal jab. So, while the author's concern was valid, the approach was flawed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the underlying issue was serious.\n"
