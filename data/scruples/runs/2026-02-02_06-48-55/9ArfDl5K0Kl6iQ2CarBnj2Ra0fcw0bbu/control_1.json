However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo a strict dieting program that led to the daughter becoming severely underweight. The author, upon witnessing this and contacting CPS (which didn't result in action), confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable, possibly even abusive, as the daughter was forced into a harmful diet. The author tried to help by calling CPS, but that didn't work. Then, the author made a pointed comment to Annie, using her daughter's situation to imply Annie should lose weight too.\n\nNow, the question is about the author's action of making that comment. Is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to address the issue of Annie's harmful behavior. They were concerned for the daughter's well-being and took action by contacting CPS. However, after that didn't work, they decided to confront Annie in a roundabout way by suggesting she join the program. But the comment was indirect, not directly criticizing Annie's weight, but implying she should do what her daughter did. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author's intentions were good, targeting someone's weight can be a sensitive issue. Making a comment that implies someone should lose weight, even if it's in response to their harmful actions towards another, can be seen as crossing a line. Weight is a personal matter and can be a sensitive topic. Even if Annie's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be the most appropriate. It's possible that the author's comment could be seen as a form of retaliation or shaming, which might not be effective in changing Annie's behavior and could be unkind.\n\nMoreover, the author admits they regret the comment but are also angry. This suggests that while they had a valid concern, their method of addressing it might not have been the best approach. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the situation. While Annie's actions are concerning, the author's comment might not address the root issue and could potentially alienate Annie, making her less likely to change her behavior. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comment could be seen as hypocritical if they themselves are not in a position to comment on Annie's weight. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the inconsistency (Annie forcing her daughter to diet while she doesn't do the same), the way it was done might be inappropriate. The author might have been trying to make a point, but using a comment that could be perceived as shaming might not be the right approach in a professional setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to do something about a situation they found harmful. They took steps by contacting CPS, which shows they were concerned. However, when that didn't work, they felt the need to act. Their comment was an attempt to hold Annie accountable for her behavior. But accountability doesn't necessarily mean making a personal attack. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention was to address the problem, but the method they used (implying Annie should lose weight) might not have been the right way. Even if the comment was indirect, it's still a personal remark about someone's body, which can be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but in terms of action, they might have overstepped. However, the main issue here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. Given that the author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive criticism, it could be seen as inconsiderate, even if well-intentioned.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while their concern for the coworker's daughter is valid, the method of addressing it by making a comment about the coworker's weight is inappropriate and could be considered shaming, which is not the right approach. Even if the comment was indirect, the implication is still about Annie's weight, which is a sensitive and personal matter. The author should have found a more appropriate way to address the issue, perhaps through more direct support for the daughter or professional intervention rather than personal criticism.\n"
