However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program, which led the daughter to become underweight and injured. The author, disturbed by this, confronted Annie by implying she should follow the same program, which they think is hypocritical.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions. The author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter. They took action by reporting to CPS, which didn't result in any action. Then, when Annie boasted about the weight loss, the author made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should do the same. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but used the implication through the diet program.\n\nIs it right for the author to confront Annie in that way? Well, the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy. However, using a public work setting to make such a comment could be seen as unprofessional or even bullying, regardless of the intent. The author's personal feelings about Annie's weight might also be a factor here. Even if Annie's actions were harmful, the author's method of responding could have been more constructive or private.\n\nAlso, the author admits to regretting the comment. That shows they acknowledge some wrongdoing. The key point is whether the method used was appropriate. The author's comment might have been a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which isn't effective and could escalate tensions. Instead of addressing the issue through proper channels (like HR or a manager) or supporting the daughter in a better way, the author chose a public jab, which is likely unprofessional.\n\nAnother angle: weight shaming is generally frowned upon. Even if the author was trying to point out a double standard, the approach involved shaming Annie's own weight, which is a sensitive topic. This could make the author complicit in the same kind of harmful behavior they criticized in Annie, just directed differently.\n\nSo, while the author's concern about the daughter's welfare is valid, their method of addressing it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
