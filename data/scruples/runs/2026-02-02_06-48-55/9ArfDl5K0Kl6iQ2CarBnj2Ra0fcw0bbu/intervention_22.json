However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, given the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo a strict weight loss program that seems unhealthy. The author, upset about this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should start the same program. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are:\n\n1. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. She used her daughter's college funds for a weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and harming herself. The author reported this to CPS, which didn't result in action. That part is serious and shows Annie's behavior is harmful.\n\n2. The author made a comment to Annie about starting the same program. The comment was indirect, not directly calling her out for her weight but implying she should do it too. The author regrets it but is also angry at Annie's hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author had a motive: trying to address Annie's harmful behavior by holding her accountable. However, the method used was a sarcastic jab, which might not be the best approach but perhaps was a reaction to frustration.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. In a workplace, directly addressing someone about their personal habits, especially weight, can be sensitive. Even if the intention was to point out hypocrisy, the method might be considered unprofessional or rude.\n\nHowever, considering Annie's harmful actions towards her daughter, the author's comment could be seen as a justified expression of frustration. But the author's approach might have been inappropriate in a professional setting. The author's comment didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used a veiled implication. This might not be the best way to handle it, but is it morally wrong?\n\nAlso, the author's initial concern about the daughter led them to call CPS, which is a responsible action. The comment was after that. The fact that Annie's daughter hasn't come back might be due to the situation being resolved or the daughter avoiding the office.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the author's intent to address Annie's harmful behavior and the appropriateness of their method. While the author had a valid reason for being upset, the way they addressed it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the severity of Annie's actions might make the author's comment a reaction to a more serious issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't directly address the root problem (Annie's treatment of her daughter) but instead focused on Annie's weight in a passive way. Alternatively, the author could argue that they were trying to hold Annie accountable for her hypocrisy.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because the method used was unprofessional and potentially hurtful, even if the intention was to address a larger issue. However, the context of Annie's harmful actions complicates it. Depending on cultural or personal views on body shaming, the answer might vary. But the main issue is that the author's comment was a personal jab rather than a constructive approach.\n"
