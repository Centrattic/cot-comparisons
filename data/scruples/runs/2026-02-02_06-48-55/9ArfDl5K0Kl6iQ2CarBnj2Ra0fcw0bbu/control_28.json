However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author confronting their coworker, Annie, about her forcing her daughter into a potentially harmful weight loss program. The author then jokes about Annie joining the same program, implying she should lose weight too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Annie's actions toward her daughter are questionable. The daughter was underweight, had multiple extracurricular activities, and was using her college funds. The author did contact CPS, but nothing came of it. The author felt compelled to respond when Annie boasted about the daughter's weight loss, so they made a comment implying Annie should do the same. \n\nThe author's comment was indirect; they didn't directly tell Annie she's overweight but suggested the program could work for her. However, the implication was clear. The question is whether this response was appropriate or if it crossed a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie forcing her daughter to diet while not doing anything herself. They were motivated by concern for the daughter's well-being. But on the other hand, making a snide remark about someone's weight, even if it's a form of passive-aggressive criticism, can be hurtful and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. Weight is a sensitive topic, and public shaming, even indirect, might not be the right approach. The author could have chosen to address their concerns through more constructive means, like discussing with the daughter or seeking further help through proper channels instead of making a jab at Annie.\n\nAlso, considering that the author had already contacted CPS, maybe they felt they had exhausted those options. But the comment might have been a knee-jerk reaction born out of frustration. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the situation. While the intention was to call out Annie's behavior, the method used might have been inappropriate, especially in a professional environment. The author regrets the comment, which suggests they see it as a mistake. However, the underlying issue with Annie's treatment of her daughter is a bigger concern, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing in their response.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, the way they addressed it by making a passive-aggressive comment about Annie's weight is likely inconsiderate and unprofessional. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
