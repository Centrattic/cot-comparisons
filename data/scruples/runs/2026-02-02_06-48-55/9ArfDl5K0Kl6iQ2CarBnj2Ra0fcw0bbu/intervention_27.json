However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the given situation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo a strict diet program, taking money from the daughter's college fund. The daughter is now underweight and in poor health. The author, disturbed by this, called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's weight loss, the author sarcastically suggested she try the same program, implying she should lose weight too. Now they're wondering if they were wrong to make that comment.\n\nThe key points here are about the ethics of the author's actions. The author's main justification is that Annie was being hypocritical by not taking the same steps to lose weight herself. However, the author directly targeted Annie's weight, which is a sensitive personal matter, using a public comment. Even though they didn't explicitly say \"you're overweight,\" the implication was clear. \n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, commenting on someone's weight, especially in a sarcastic or mocking way, is generally considered inappropriate and can be seen as bullying or harassment. The author might have thought they were pointing out hypocrisy, but the method used was a personal attack rather than addressing the larger issue of Annie's treatment of her daughter.\n\nAlso, the author had previously taken the correct step by reporting to CPS, which shows concern for the daughter's welfare. However, the follow-up comment to Annie crosses a line into personal criticism, which might not be justified in the workplace. Even if the author had good intentions, the approach could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might have a right to be upset about Annie's actions, but responding with a sarcastic remark isn't the most effective or appropriate way to address it. The author should consider other methods, like discussing the issue with HR or the company's ethics committee if workplace policies are violated, rather than making personal comments.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid and their initial action of calling CPS was right, the sarcastic remark directed at Annie's weight is inappropriate. It's a personal issue that doesn't need to be addressed in the workplace in such a public and personal manner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for that comment.\n"
