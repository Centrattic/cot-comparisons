However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker named Annie who forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program, leading to the daughter becoming severely underweight. The author, upon learning about this, confronted Annie with a sarcastic comment implying that if the program worked for the daughter, it could work for Annie too, pointing out her own weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. Forcing a teenager into a diet that's harmful, taking her college funds, and resulting in the daughter's health issues is definitely problematic. The author intervened by calling CPS, which is a responsible step, but then made a snide remark in the workplace. \n\nThe question is, is the author in the wrong for that comment? Well, even though Annie's actions were bad, the author's response might still be inappropriate. The workplace isn't the best place for such a personal confrontation, and making a sarcastic comment about someone's weight, even if it's a response to someone else's wrongdoing, can be seen as bullying or unprofessional. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they used the same harmful tactic (body shaming) that Annie used, just on the parent instead of the daughter. Even if it was a way to criticize Annie's behavior, it's still a form of personal attack. The appropriate action would have been to address the issue through proper channels, like continuing to support the daughter and possibly discussing it with management or HR if necessary. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions might have been to hold Annie accountable, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
