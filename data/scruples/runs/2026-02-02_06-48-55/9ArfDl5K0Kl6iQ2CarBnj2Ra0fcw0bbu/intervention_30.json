However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, forcing her daughter into an extreme diet program that led to the daughter being underweight and suffering. The author, concerned about the daughter, called CPS but it didn't lead to action. Then, the author confronted Annie by suggesting she start the same program, implying she should lose weight.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author's comment. They didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but implied it. The question is whether that's wrong. \n\nAnnie's actions toward her daughter are clearly harmful. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet that causes health issues is problematic. The author was right to be concerned and call CPS, but maybe that didn't help. Now, the author's response was to use indirect pressure on Annie by suggesting she join the same program. \n\nIs this acceptable? Well, even if the author's intent was to hold Annie accountable, the method of doing so by making a comment about her weight could be seen as bullying or discriminatory. Even if the author's intention was good, using a passive-aggressive approach might not be the right way. The comment could be seen as targeting Annie based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that Annie is the one who needs to lose weight implies a judgment about her body, which can be hurtful regardless of the context. Even if the author believes Annie's behavior toward her daughter was wrong, the way they addressed it might cross a line. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to address the harmful behavior towards a minor. But in doing so, they focused on Annie's weight rather than the actual issue, which was the forced diet on the daughter. That might not be the most effective or ethical approach. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's comment, while perhaps well-intentioned, is still a form of weight-based shaming and could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making that comment.\n"
