However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet after witnessing the coworker force her daughter into a harmful weight loss program.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet that took money away from her college fund. The daughter lost a lot of weight, became underweight, and is now injured and sick. The author called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then the author made a comment to Annie implying she should join the same program, using the daughter's success as a reason.\n\nThe author's main argument is that Annie is being hypocritical by making her daughter lose weight while she remains overweight. The author is upset about the harm done to the daughter and the mother's lack of self-improvement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Intent vs. Action**: The author's intent was to call out Annie's hypocrisy and potentially help her by suggesting a diet. However, the method used was indirect and implied, which might be seen as passive-aggressive or mean.\n\n2. **Impact on Annie**: The comment might have embarrassed Annie or made her defensive. However, Annie's behavior towards her daughter is questionable, so the author is reacting to a harmful situation. \n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Approach**: The author didn't directly confront Annie about her mistreatment of the daughter, which could have been more effective. Instead, they used a backhanded comment, which might not be the best approach but could be seen as a reaction to frustration.\n\n4. **Moral Responsibility**: The author tried to help by reporting to CPS but was ineffective. Their follow-up action was a personal comment. Whether this was the right way to address it is debatable. \n\n5. **Hypocrisy and Accountability**: It's valid to point out hypocrisy if someone is harming others. However, using body shaming as a tool can be counterproductive and harmful, even if the intent is to highlight the issue.\n\n6. **Potential for Harm**: The author's comment might have made Annie feel targeted, but given the severity of Annie's actions towards her daughter, the author's intent is to address a bigger problem. However, the method is questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to address a serious issue, the approach was passive-aggressive and may not have been the most constructive. The author is not entirely in the wrong because they were trying to highlight a harmful situation, but the method used could have been more direct and compassionate. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the direct confrontation might be better, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for the approach taken.\n"
