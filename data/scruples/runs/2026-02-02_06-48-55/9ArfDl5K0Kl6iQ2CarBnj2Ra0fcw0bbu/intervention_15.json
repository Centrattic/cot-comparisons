However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, forcing her daughter into an extreme diet program that led to the daughter becoming severely underweight. The author, after calling Child Protective Services (CPS) which didn't result in action, confronted Annie by implying she should do the same diet program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Annie's actions towards her daughter are clearly harmful. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet that's detrimental to her health is concerning. The author tried to act by contacting CPS, which is a responsible step. However, when that didn't yield results, the author decided to confront Annie in a way that's subtle but could be seen as mocking or shaming.\n\nThe author's comment was a backhanded suggestion that Annie should adopt the same diet, implying that she needs to lose weight. While the author didn't directly address Annie's weight, the implication is there. Now, even though the author's intentions might have been to hold Annie accountable for her double standard, the method used could be problematic. \n\nIs it ethical to publicly imply that someone should lose weight, even if they've harmed their child? Weight-related comments can be highly sensitive and often perpetuate body shaming. Even if the intent was to highlight hypocrisy, the approach might have been unproductive and could have worsened the situation. The author might have crossed a line by using a personal issue as a means of confrontation.\n\nAdditionally, the author regrets the comment, which suggests they recognize it wasn't the best approach. However, the act of shaming someone about their weight, regardless of the context, can be harmful. It's possible that the author's action undermined any potential for a constructive dialogue with Annie about the daughter's well-being. \n\nSo, while Annie's actions as a mother are indefensible, the author's response might not be justified either. The right approach might have been to continue advocating for the daughter through appropriate channels rather than resorting to personal jabs. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for using a potentially hurtful method to address a serious issue.\n"
