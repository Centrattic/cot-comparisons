However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the given story. The situation involves Annie, the coworker, who forced her daughter into an extreme diet program, and the author confronts her by suggesting she join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author witnessed Annie's daughter being subjected to an unhealthy weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and in trouble. The author reported it to CPS, but no action was taken. Then, the author made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should try the same diet. The coworker was taken aback but didn't respond further, and the daughter hasn't been seen since.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate. On one hand, the author was trying to address the injustice they saw. The daughter's situation was harmful, and the author felt compelled to act. However, using a backhanded comment might not be the best approach, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. While the coworker's actions were harmful, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. Commenting on someone's weight, even indirectly, is often considered personal and not professional. It's possible that the author intended to highlight the hypocrisy, but public shaming or indirect attacks might not be effective or respectful. \n\nAlso, the author had already taken the step of contacting CPS, which is the proper course of action. The follow-up comment might have been an emotional reaction rather than a constructive solution. Even if the coworker is in the wrong for her actions towards her daughter, the author's method of confrontation could be unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. Weight-based comments can be a form of harassment, and the author might be at fault here despite their intentions.\n\nAdditionally, the author regrets their comment, which suggests they realize there's a problem. The coworker's silence afterward could be due to embarrassment or feeling attacked, which doesn't resolve the underlying issue. The daughter's absence is concerning, but it's unclear if the author's comment directly caused that.\n\nIn summary, while the coworker's actions were wrong, the author's method of addressing it might be inappropriate. The right approach would be to continue advocating through proper channels rather than personal attacks. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their comment.\n"
