However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author confronting an overweight coworker about her weight after witnessing the coworker's harmful actions toward her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into an extreme diet program, which led the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, upset by this, made a comment implying that Annie should join the same program. The key points here are the intent behind the comment and whether the author had the right to make it.\n\nThe author's motivation was concern for the daughter's well-being. However, the method of addressing the issue was a passive-aggressive remark rather than a direct intervention. While the author's intention might have been to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, public shaming or indirect comments can be seen as inappropriate, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nAlso, the author did report the situation to CPS, which is a valid step. But their follow-up comment to Annie was meant to provoke, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the comment was implied, it's a form of mockery that could be offensive. The author might have a valid concern, but the approach taken could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially if it's based on Annie's weight. \n\nAnnie's actions as a parent are definitely problematic, but the author's response should have perhaps been more constructive. Instead of making a snide remark, they might have addressed it through appropriate channels or private conversation. The public nature of the comment and the focus on Annie's weight without consent could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their concerns were legitimate.\n"
