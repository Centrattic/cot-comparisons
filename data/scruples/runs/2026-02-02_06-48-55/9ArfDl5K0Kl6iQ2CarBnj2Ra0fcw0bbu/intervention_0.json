However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting a coworker, Annie, about her weight after finding out that Annie forced her daughter into an extreme dieting program. The author's comment was a passive-aggressive jab implying that Annie should also lose weight, which made Annie stop talking to them and their daughter hasn't returned to the office.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter, which they found harmful. They called Child Protective Services (CPS), but nothing happened. Then, the author made a comment linking Annie's daughter's weight loss program to Annie's own weight, suggesting she should try it. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let's consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy of Annie, who imposed a strict diet on her daughter without addressing her own weight. However, the method used was indirect and possibly hurtful. Making a comment about someone's weight can be a sensitive issue, especially in a professional setting. Even if the author's intent was to highlight the problem, the approach might have been inappropriate.\n\nAnnie's actions towards her daughter are clearly concerning. The diet program sounds extreme and potentially harmful, especially for a teenager involved in multiple sports and academics. The daughter's health and financial future were at risk, which the author tried to address by involving CPS. However, the author's subsequent comment about Annie's weight might not have been the best way to handle the situation. It's possible that the author was trying to get Annie to reflect on her actions, but by focusing on her own weight, it might have been counterproductive and could have caused a personal attack rather than addressing the root issue.\n\nIn terms of professional conduct, it's generally not advisable to make personal comments about a coworker's body unless it's directly related to a work issue. The author's comment, while perhaps intended to highlight Annie's hypocrisy, could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of confronting the issue in a public or semi-public setting (like an office) might not have been appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the daughter hasn't returned to the office after the incident might indicate that the situation was exacerbated by the author's comment. The author might have crossed a line by using a personal jab instead of finding a more constructive way to address the issue, such as discussing it privately with Annie or involving appropriate authorities more effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to help the daughter by involving CPS and then felt frustrated that nothing was done. Their comment might have been a reaction to that helplessness. However, making a personal attack on Annie's weight could have the opposite effect, making Annie defensive and less likely to change her behavior or seek help.\n\nIn summary, while the author had good intentions in wanting to protect the daughter and address the harmful diet, the approach taken was unprofessional and potentially hurtful. The comment about Annie's weight could be seen as a HIPAA violation if the daughter's health information was shared without consent, and it's also a form of personal attack that doesn't address the root issue. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for the method used, even if the concern was valid.\n"
