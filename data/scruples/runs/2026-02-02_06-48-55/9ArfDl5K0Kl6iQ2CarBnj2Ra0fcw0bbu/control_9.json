However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker's harmful actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into an extreme diet program. The daughter was already healthy, involved in sports and academics, but Annie took her savings and made her starve. The daughter became underweight and injured, and CPS didn't take action. The author, upset by this, then confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight too. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Annie's actions toward her daughter are clearly harmful and abusive. The author tried to help by reporting to CPS, which didn't work. Then, the author used a backhanded approach to criticize Annie's behavior by suggesting she lose weight. The question is whether this response was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is pointing out the hypocrisy (Annie demanding her daughter to diet but not herself) and using a form of public shaming. However, directly commenting on someone's weight in a professional setting can be problematic and might not be the best way to address the issue. But given Annie's abusive behavior, the author's intent was to highlight the inconsistency and maybe provoke change.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for making a comment, but ethically, it's a gray area. The main issue is whether the author's method was appropriate. While the situation with Annie's daughter is awful, the author's response could be seen as taking matters into their own hands in a way that could be hurtful. However, the alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014might also be criticized, given the harm Annie caused.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author might have crossed a line by making a passive-aggressive comment about weight, which is a sensitive topic. But the underlying issue of child abuse is serious. The author's intention was to hold Annie accountable, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action was a reaction to a severe case of child mistreatment by a colleague. While the method might not be the best approach, the intent was to address a serious problem. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong, even though their approach was questionable.\n"
