However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, after finding out about this and the daughter's poor condition, made a sarcastic comment to Annie about starting the same program, implying she should lose weight too.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's coworker did something harmful to her daughter, leading to the daughter being underweight and in poor health. The author tried to intervene by calling Child Protective Services, but nothing came of it. Then, the author made a comment that was intended to shame Annie into losing weight herself, using the same program that was forced on the daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the situation. On one hand, the author was trying to address a harmful situation and perhaps highlight the hypocrisy of Annie. On the other hand, the author's comment was a direct jab at Annie's weight, which could be seen as bullying or inappropriate workplace behavior.\n\nEven though the author's intentions were to help the daughter, the method of confronting Annie by attacking her weight might not be the right approach. Workplace interactions should generally avoid personal attacks, even if the intent is to correct harmful behavior. The author might have violated workplace etiquette by making a personal comment about weight, which is a sensitive issue. Additionally, the author's comment could be seen as passive-aggressive rather than addressing the issue directly with appropriate channels.\n\nHowever, the author did take action (calling CPS) when they noticed the daughter's condition, which was a positive step. But the way they addressed Annie's own weight might not be effective or appropriate. The comment could have backfired, causing Annie to withdraw or become defensive, rather than addressing the underlying issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's approach was perhaps not the best way to handle the situation. While the concern for the daughter is valid, making a personal comment about weight in the workplace, especially without a direct link to the daughter's situation, could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if the intent was to help.\n"
