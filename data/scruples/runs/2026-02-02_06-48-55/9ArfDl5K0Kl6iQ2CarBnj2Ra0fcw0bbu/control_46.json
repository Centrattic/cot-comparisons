However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a coworker of Annie's, and Annie's daughter has gone through a really intense weight loss program. The program involved the daughter using her college tuition money, which makes me think it's problematic because the daughter had other plans for that money. The author found out that Annie forced her daughter into this, and the daughter is now underweight and injured. The author called CPS, but nothing came from it. Then, when Annie was boasting about the daughter's success, the author made a sarcastic comment implying that Annie should also do the program. Now Annie hasn't spoken to the author, and the daughter hasn't come to the office.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The main issue here is the author's comment to Annie. The author is upset because Annie made her daughter go on a harmful diet without doing it herself. The comment was meant to highlight the hypocrisy, but the author says they didn't directly say Annie was overweight, just implied it. However, the way it was done\u2014by linking the daughter's success to Annie's need to do the same\u2014might be seen as shaming or using a child's situation to target the parent's weight. \n\nAnnie's actions towards her daughter are definitely concerning. Using the daughter's savings for a program that resulted in her being underweight and injured is abusive. The author had a right to be worried and to take action, like calling CPS. But the follow-up comment to Annie might cross a line. Even if it's implied, making a sarcastic or backhanded remark about someone's weight in a professional setting could be seen as unkind and possibly contributing to a hostile work environment. The author might have thought they were being clever by pointing out the hypocrisy, but it's not appropriate to use a child's health issues as a way to make a comment about the parent's weight. That's personal and could be hurtful, especially when the parent is already in the wrong. The author could have approached the situation in a more constructive way, maybe by discussing their concerns about the program's effects on the daughter instead of focusing on Annie's weight. \n\nAlso, the author's intention might be to correct Annie's behavior, but the method was indirect and potentially harmful. Weight is a sensitive topic, and even if the author's comment was meant to be a gentle nudge, it might have been perceived as cruel or invasive. The daughter's well-being is the primary concern, and while the author did act on that by calling CPS, using the daughter's situation to make a comment about the mother's weight could be seen as using the child as a pawn in a personal vendetta. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to help the daughter and was upset about the mother's hypocrisy. But in a workplace, especially with coworkers, it's important to keep interactions professional. The author's comment, while possibly not the worst thing, does come across as crossing a line. The fact that Annie was startled and hasn't spoken to the author since might indicate that the comment was unwelcome and unprofessional. The daughter's fear of taking out more loans due to losing the money also adds to the ethical dilemma of the program, but the author's response might not have been the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions in making the comment about Annie's weight, even if implied, were likely wrong because they were using a sensitive personal issue of the daughter to target the mother in a professional setting. The appropriate action would have been to address the daughter's situation directly through the proper channels, like CPS, rather than making a personal jab at the mother's weight. The author's intention was to correct a harmful behavior, but the method was inappropriate and could be seen as shaming, which is not constructive in a workplace environment.\n"
