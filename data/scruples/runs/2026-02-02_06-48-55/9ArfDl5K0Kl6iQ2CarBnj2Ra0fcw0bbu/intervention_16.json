However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet and weight loss program. The daughter wasn't eating properly, lost a lot of weight, and became underweight. The author found out about this and was upset. Then, when Annie was boasting about her daughter's weight loss, the author told her to go on the same program, implying that Annie should lose weight. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking at Annie's actions. Forcing a teenager to starve herself to lose weight sounds like an eating disorder, especially since the daughter is in sports and academics, which requires energy. The author mentioned calling CPS, but they didn't find anything. However, the daughter is now underweight and self-harming. That's really concerning. So Annie's actions are harmful and possibly abusive.\n\nNow, the author's response was to mock Annie by suggesting she go on the same program. The author didn't directly confront Annie about her daughter but instead made a comment about her own weight. The author is using guilt-tripping or shaming as a response. \n\nIs that justified? Well, the author has a right to be upset, but responding with a passive-aggressive comment might not be the best approach. The author could have addressed the issue more directly with Annie, perhaps confronting her about her treatment of the daughter, or talking to her daughter to offer support. Instead, they chose to imply that Annie should lose weight, which might not address the root problem and could come across as cruel or hypocritical if the author isn't in a position to comment on Annie's weight. \n\nAlso, public shaming can be counterproductive. It might make Annie defensive and less likely to address the real issue. The author's intention was to make Annie see her hypocrisy, but the method might not be appropriate. The author could be seen as taking a passive way out their anger rather than addressing the actual problem head-on.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did act in response to a harmful situation. They tried to help by involving CPS, but that didn't work. They were trying to make Annie aware of her own issues, but maybe the approach was wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was a form of shaming, which isn't helpful. The real issue is Annie's treatment of her daughter, and the author's response didn't directly address that. The author is in the wrong because they used a passive-aggressive comment instead of a constructive approach. Even though Annie's actions are bad, the author's method of confronting her was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
