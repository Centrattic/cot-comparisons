However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter into a harmful weight loss program, which the author found out about and then confronted by implying Annie should do the same.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. She used her daughter's college funds for a program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The author, out of anger and a desire to address the hypocrisy, made a comment suggesting Annie should join the program. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the situation.\n\nThe author's intent was to call out Annie's hypocrisy. They didn't directly accuse her of wrongdoing but used reverse psychology by suggesting she should also diet. However, making a comment about someone's weight, even if motivated by concern, can be seen as crossing a boundary. Weight is a sensitive topic and can be a form of bullying. The author might not have had the right to comment on Annie's weight, regardless of Annie's actions towards her daughter.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions might not have been the most effective way to address the issue. Instead of confronting Annie directly about her harmful behavior towards her daughter, the author chose to imply that Annie should lose weight. This could be seen as using a personal attack rather than addressing the actual problem, which is the treatment of Annie's daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about the daughter's well-being and had already contacted CPS, which didn't yield results. The comment might have been an emotional reaction to the situation, possibly fueled by frustration. However, even with good intentions, the method used could be problematic. It's possible that the author's comment could have made Annie defensive, leading to a breakdown in communication rather than solving the issue.\n\nMoreover, the question of whether the author is in the wrong involves considering workplace dynamics. Commenting on a coworker's weight in a professional setting is generally inappropriate and can lead to harassment claims. The author's approach might not only be unethical but also unprofessional.\n\nIn conclusion, while Annie's actions are troubling, the author's response of making a comment about her weight is not the right approach. The author's intent might have been to address the underlying issue, but the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
