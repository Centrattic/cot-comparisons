However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The author, who's the narrator, called out Annie by implying she should do the same program. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's action was appropriate. The key points here are about the daughter's situation. The author noticed the daughter's health declining and even contacted CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author made a comment to Annie suggesting she should follow the same program. \n\nThe author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, right? But the method of confronting her was indirect, using implied criticism. The question is whether this was the right approach. \n\nOn one hand, the author was concerned about the daughter's well-being and was upset about the mother's actions. The comment might have been a way to express frustration and possibly prompt Annie to reflect. However, using a passive-aggressive comment might not have been the best approach, as it could be seen as shaming Annie for her weight. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't directly address the daughter's situation in the comment. The comment was more about pointing out the inconsistency in Annie's actions. But even so, making a public comment about someone's weight, even if it's implying they should lose weight, could be considered rude or unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nAlso, the author had already taken steps by contacting CPS, so maybe the comment wasn't effective. The daughter hasn't come back to the office, which might be a consequence of the situation. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author's comment was in the wrong. The author's intention was to call out Annie's hypocrisy, but the method might not have been appropriate. The comment could be seen as a form of shaming, which might not be the best way to address such a sensitive issue. However, given the context of the daughter's abuse, perhaps the author was trying to help. \n\nBut weight shaming is generally considered inappropriate, and even if the author's intent was to protect the daughter, the approach could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong for using a comment that could be seen as bullying or unprofessional, even if the underlying concern was valid. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author was justified in trying to highlight the hypocrisy, especially after the daughter was harmed. But the line between standing up for someone and engaging in your own form of bullying is thin here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, the method of addressing Annie's weight was likely inappropriate and could be seen as inconsiderate, thus making the author at fault.\n"
