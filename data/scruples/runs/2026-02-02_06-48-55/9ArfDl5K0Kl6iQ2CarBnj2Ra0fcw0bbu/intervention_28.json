However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, forcing her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, upset by Annie's actions, made an implied comment about Annie joining the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had good intentions, wanting to address the hypocrisy of Annie not doing the same for herself. However, making a comment about someone's weight can be sensitive and potentially hurtful. Even if the comment was implied, it's a personal topic that others might not appreciate, especially if they're already dealing with their own issues.\n\nNext, the legality. Weight discrimination can be a protected class in some areas, so commenting on someone's weight could be problematic. Even if it's not illegal, it's generally considered poor judgment. The author's intention was to highlight Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter, but using Annie's own weight as a response might not be the best approach. It could come off as bullying or contributing to the stigma around weight issues.\n\nThen, the effectiveness. Did the author's comment lead to a positive outcome? It seems Annie hasn't mentioned it again, and the daughter hasn't returned. It's possible the comment had unintended consequences, like making Annie defensive or causing her to withdraw. The author might have hoped to encourage Annie to address her own health, but the method was confrontational rather than supportive.\n\nAlso, the author's responsibility in the situation. They did the right thing by contacting CPS when they noticed the daughter's condition. However, taking the next step of commenting on Annie's weight might be crossing a line. The author's frustration is understandable, but there might be better ways to handle it, like discussing it with HR or management if appropriate, rather than making a personal jab.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern for the coworker's daughter is valid, the method of addressing it by commenting on the coworker's own weight is problematic. It's a form of personal attack that might not be effective and could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their approach.\n"
