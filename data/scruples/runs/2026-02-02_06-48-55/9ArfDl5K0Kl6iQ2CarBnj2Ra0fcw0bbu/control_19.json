However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a strict diet program, leading to her becoming underweight. The author, feeling upset about this, told Annie to go on the same program, implying that she should do it herself since she's overweight. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about Annie's daughter being harmed by an extreme diet. They even contacted Child Protective Services, which didn't result in action. The author's coworker is making their daughter go through something that could be harmful, and the author is upset about that. \n\nNow, the author's response was to tell Annie to start the program herself. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used a comment that implied criticism. The key here is whether this response was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics and interpersonal relations, pointing out someone's behavior that's harmful and then suggesting they should apply the same to themselves might be seen as a form of indirect confrontation. However, the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, not just to make a personal jab. But making a comment about someone's weight, even if it's implied, can be sensitive and potentially offensive. \n\nBut the bigger issue is the author's motivation. They were trying to address a harmful situation. However, the method they chose might not be the best approach. Instead of directly confronting Annie or involving proper authorities, they used a public comment that could be seen as shaming. \n\nAlso, the author's coworker is the one who's responsible for the harmful actions towards her daughter. The author is reacting to that, but their method of response might not be the most constructive. The comment could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than a direct intervention. \n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, it's important to consider how such a comment might affect professional relationships. The author's approach might come off as unprofessional, even if their intentions were good. However, the underlying concern is valid because the daughter's health is at risk. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's concern is justified, but their method of addressing it was perhaps not the most effective or appropriate. They might have a valid point about the hypocrisy, but using a comment about someone's weight to highlight that could be seen as shaming, which isn't the best approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, but the underlying issue is more about Annie's actions. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the context. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they used a shaming tactic that could be considered unkind and unprofessional, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
