However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to undergo an extreme weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and unhealthy. The author, witnessing this, felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should do the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's coworker is making a bad decision regarding her daughter's health. The author's intention was to call out the hypocrisy of Annie, but the method used was a snide comment implying the same program should apply to Annie. The question is whether that comment was appropriate.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to correct an injustice they observed. However, the method of doing so by making a sarcastic remark might not be constructive. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, can be seen as bullying. The author might not have had the authority to confront Annie directly, so using a passive-aggressive comment could have been the only option they felt they had.\n\nBut the key point is that the author didn't directly address the harmful behavior towards the daughter. Instead, they targeted Annie's own weight. While Annie's actions are questionable, the author's response might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author should have reported the situation through proper channels (like HR or authorities) instead of making a personal jab.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt powerless and used the only way they could think of to make a point. However, the consequences could include damaging the coworker relationship and not actually helping the daughter. The author's comment might not have led to a solution and could have made Annie defensive, preventing any real change.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in a difficult position, but their approach might be considered inappropriate because they didn't address the root issue effectively and instead resorted to a personal attack, even if it was a subtle one. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's also a case that they were trying to do something good, so maybe B (not in the wrong). Need to weigh these factors.\n"
