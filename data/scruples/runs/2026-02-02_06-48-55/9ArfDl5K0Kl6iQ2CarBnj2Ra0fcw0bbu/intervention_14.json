However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, forcing her daughter into a strict diet program that led to her being underweight and in poor health. The author, seeing this, then told Annie to join the same program, implying she should lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset about Annie's actions towards her daughter, which were harmful. They took action by reporting to CPS, which didn't result in any action. Then, in response, the author made a comment suggesting Annie should also go on the diet. The question is whether that comment was wrong.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, using someone else's harmful behavior to justify a similar action towards them is a classic case of \"might makes right,\" which isn't a valid ethical stance. Even if the coworker's actions were harmful, the author's response could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, which might be seen as a way to point out a problem.\n\nBut in terms of workplace ethics and personal boundaries, commenting on someone's weight is generally considered inappropriate. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a passive-aggressive comment can create a hostile work environment. Even if the author's intention was to help Annie or point out her hypocrisy, the approach was unprofessional.\n\nAdditionally, the author's action might not have been the best way to address the issue. The real problem was Annie's treatment of her daughter, which the author tried to address by involving CPS. The comment about the diet might have been a way to express frustration, but it's not a constructive response. It's possible that the author should have focused on supporting the daughter instead of confronting Annie directly in a public or passive-aggressive manner.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to correct an injustice they observed. While the method was flawed, the intention wasn't malicious. The key here is whether the means used were appropriate. In a workplace setting, making a snide comment about a colleague's weight is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reasoning. It's important to address issues like this through appropriate channels rather than personal confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's comment was inappropriate and unprofessional. Even if their intention was to highlight a problem, the method crossed a line. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
