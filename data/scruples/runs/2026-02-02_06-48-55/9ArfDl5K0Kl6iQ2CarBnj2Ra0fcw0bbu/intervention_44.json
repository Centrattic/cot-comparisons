However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation they described. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author, let's call them \"the speaker,\" is upset because their coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a dangerous weight loss program. The daughter lost a lot of weight, became underweight, and is now injured. The speaker called CPS, but nothing happened. Then, the speaker confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program, leading to Annie not speaking to them anymore.\n\nThe main question is whether the speaker's action was in the wrong. The user thinks the speaker is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nLet me break down the key points. Annie's actions towards her daughter were harmful. The speaker is concerned about the daughter's health and possibly right to intervene. However, the speaker's response was to publicly imply that Annie should lose weight, which is a personal attack. \n\nEven though the speaker's intention was to confront Annie about her harmful behavior towards her daughter, using a comment about the mother's weight might be seen as crossing a line. The speaker's comment was indirect but carried the implication that Annie is also overweight and should lose weight. This could be considered a personal and potentially hurtful remark, regardless of the underlying reason. \n\nBut on the other hand, the speaker's motivation was to address a serious issue where Annie's actions were endangering her daughter. The speaker might feel justified in trying to call out the mother's harmful behavior through a personal jab. However, the method used could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle: the speaker had already called CPS and didn't get the desired outcome. Then, they resorted to a personal attack, which might not be the most effective or appropriate way to handle the situation. Publicly shaming someone, even if it's a subtle implication, can be counterproductive and may not address the root issue effectively. \n\nAlso, making a comment about someone's weight in a professional setting is generally considered inappropriate. It can lead to a hostile work environment and might be seen as discriminatory. Even if the speaker's intent was to highlight the mother's hypocrisy, the method was unprofessional and could be viewed as bullying or harassment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the speaker's action was inappropriate and unprofessional. Even though the underlying issue is concerning, the speaker should have found a more appropriate way to address it, such as involving the company's HR or other authorities instead of personally attacking the coworker. Therefore, the speaker is in the wrong.\n"
