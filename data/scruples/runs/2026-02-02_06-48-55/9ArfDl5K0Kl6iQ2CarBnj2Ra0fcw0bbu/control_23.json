However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to follow an extreme diet program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should follow the same diet, which caused some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. Forcing a teenager to starve herself, even in the name of weight loss, can be harmful, especially if the girl is already active in sports and academics. The author's concern is valid because they noticed the daughter's deteriorating health and even contacted CPS, which didn't result in action. This shows the author genuinely cares about the daughter's well-being.\n\nNow, the author's response was to make a comment implying that Annie should take her own advice. While the author didn't directly accuse Annie of anything, the comment was a form of passive-aggressive confrontation. The key issue here is whether this approach was appropriate. Directly confronting someone about their weight in a public or professional setting, even with good intentions, can be seen as crossing a line. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making such a comment could be perceived as bullying or violating privacy.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to address the injustice done to the daughter. The comment was a reaction to Annie's harmful behavior. But even with good intentions, the method might not be the best. The author might have considered reporting Annie's actions through proper channels instead of making a personal jab. The fact that the author regrets the comment after the fact suggests they recognize it wasn't the most effective or respectful approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is legitimate. They tried to help the daughter by calling CPS, and when that didn't work, they felt the need to take a stand. The comment was a way to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie's actions. But in a professional setting, such a comment could damage relationships and might not be the best way to effect change. The author might have overstepped by using their coworker's personal life as a way to address the daughter's situation.\n\nIn terms of the author's wrongdoing, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent was to correct a harmful action, but the method was inappropriate. The author is in the wrong because they targeted Annie's personal health issue in a public and potentially unprofessional manner. However, the underlying issue with Annie's treatment of her daughter is definitely problematic, and the author's concern is valid. The balance here is between standing up for someone else's child and respecting boundaries in the workplace.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach was unprofessional and could be seen as bullying, even if their intentions were to help the daughter. The author should have used more appropriate channels to address Annie's behavior towards her daughter instead of making a personal attack.\n"
