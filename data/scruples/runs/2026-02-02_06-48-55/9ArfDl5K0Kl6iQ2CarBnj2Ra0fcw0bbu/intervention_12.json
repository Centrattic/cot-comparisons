However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling an overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should also start the same program, using her daughter's example. The author's intention was likely to highlight the hypocrisy and the harmful effects of Annie's actions. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author's response was justified. The author's comment was a direct jab at Annie's own weight, using the situation to point out the problem. While the author was trying to address the harm Annie caused her daughter, the method was a personal attack on Annie's body. Even though the comment was implied rather than explicit, it's still a form of body shaming. \n\nBody shaming is generally not an appropriate way to address someone's behavior, even if the behavior is harmful. The author might have had good intentions, but the approach could be seen as crossing a line. Additionally, the author's actions didn't directly address the underlying issue of Annie's parenting decisions. Instead, it focused on Annie's weight, which is a sensitive and personal topic. \n\nAlso, considering the potential consequences, the author's comment might have made Annie defensive or less likely to change her behavior. The author's actions could have further strained their relationship and might not have been effective in helping Annie's daughter. \n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, confronting someone about a personal matter like weight, even if motivated by concern, isn't typically the right approach. There are more constructive ways to address such issues, like reporting to appropriate authorities or seeking professional help, rather than making a public jab. \n\nSo, while the author's concern for Annie's daughter is understandable, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
