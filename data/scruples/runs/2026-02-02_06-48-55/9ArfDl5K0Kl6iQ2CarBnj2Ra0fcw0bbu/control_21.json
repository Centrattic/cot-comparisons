However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet after witnessing Annie force her daughter into an extreme weight loss program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author is concerned about Annie's daughter, who was underweight and in a harmful program. The author took action by calling CPS, but that didn't result in action. Then, in a moment of frustration, the author made a comment implying Annie should lose weight, given her own weight. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author's intent was to point out the hypocrisy of Annie, who was making her daughter undergo a strict diet while not doing the same herself. The author's comment was indirect, using the success of the program on the daughter to suggest Annie should do the same. \n\nOn one hand, the author's concern for the daughter's well-being is valid. They tried to help by involving CPS. However, the author's comment might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the intent was to address Annie's behavior, targeting her weight directly could be considered bullying or a personal attack, which might not be appropriate. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't explicitly tell Annie she was overweight; they implied it. The comment was more about holding Annie accountable for her actions towards her daughter. The author's frustration is understandable given the harmful situation they witnessed. \n\nHowever, in a professional setting, making such a comment could be seen as unprofessional. The author's coworker's weight is a personal matter, and the author might not have the right to comment on it, regardless of their reasons. The main issue is whether the comment was an appropriate way to address the situation. \n\nThe author did regret the comment afterward, indicating some awareness of potential wrongdoing. The question is whether the comment was justified given the context. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might believe that by pointing out Annie's own weight, they were highlighting her hypocrisy. But others might argue that this approach was ineffective and unkind, and that other avenues (like reporting the situation again through proper channels) should have been pursued instead. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action was a personal attack, even if the intent was to address a serious issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). However, others might argue that the author was trying to correct a harmful behavior and the comment was a reaction to that (B). But since the comment was a personal jab rather than addressing Annie's actions towards her daughter directly, the answer leans towards A.\n"
