However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation they described. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict diet program that sounds harmful. The daughter was underweight afterward and had health issues. The author, after seeing this, made a comment implying Annie should start the same diet. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was concerned about the daughter's wellbeing and tried to help by reporting to CPS, which is a good action. But then, making a comment in the workplace about Annie's weight could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author's intention was to point out hypocrisy, using a passive-aggressive remark might not be the best approach.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a public comment about someone's weight, even with implied criticism, can be perceived as bullying or insensitive. The author's action might not directly solve the problem but could harm their professional relationship. However, the author was acting out of concern for the daughter, which adds context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author had good intentions, the method of addressing it was not constructive. The comment could be seen as hypocritical or an attack, especially since the author didn't directly address the mother's actions towards the daughter. Instead, they focused on Annie's weight, which is a personal issue and not the root of the problem. So, the author might be in the wrong for the approach, even if the concern was valid.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of standing up against something harmful. However, the appropriate way would be to involve authorities or talk to the daughter directly, not make a snide comment at work. The author's action could have been more about personal satisfaction than constructive resolution. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
