However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, after witnessing the daughter's deterioration, confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's coworker committed a harmful act against her daughter. The author, upon realizing this, took action by calling out Annie in a passive-aggressive way. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nThe author didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used a veiled comment to imply that Annie should lose weight. The problem is that the author is using Annie's own behavior against her, but by making a comment about the coworker's weight rather than focusing on the daughter's abuse. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method involved shaming the coworker about her weight, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author had a valid concern about the daughter's well-being. However, the way they addressed it was problematic. Instead of reporting the abuse to authorities or confronting Annie directly about her actions, they chose to retaliate by making a comment about Annie's weight. This could be seen as using a personal attack rather than addressing the real issue. Additionally, commenting on someone's weight, even if it's to highlight hypocrisy, can be considered rude and disrespectful. The author might have thought they were holding Annie accountable, but the approach was inappropriate and could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Annie's daughter is now underweight and injured, but the author's action was to imply Annie should lose weight. The underlying message is that Annie, by making her daughter lose weight, is hypocritical. However, the author's comment doesn't directly address the harm done to the daughter, which is the more urgent issue. Instead, it focuses on Annie's own weight, which is a different issue. This might not effectively address the problem and could be seen as using the wrong approach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a right to be upset about the daughter's treatment, but their method of response could be considered inconsiderate. The correct course might have been to report the situation to a higher authority or involve child protective services more effectively, rather than making a snide remark. However, the author did call CPS before, which didn't result in action. So perhaps the author felt they had to take matters into their own hands, but the method was inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to address a serious issue, their method of doing so by shaming Annie about her weight might make them at fault. The comment was a personal attack rather than a constructive solution to the daughter's problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
