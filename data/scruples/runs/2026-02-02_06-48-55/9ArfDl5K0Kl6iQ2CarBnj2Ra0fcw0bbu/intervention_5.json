However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and suffering. The author, upset by Annie's actions, made a comment implying she should start the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. Forcing a child into a diet that's harmful isn't just wrong; it's potentially abusive. The author tried to help by calling CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author's response was to make a sarcastic comment to Annie, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author's comment justified? The author was angry about Annie's treatment of her daughter and wanted to confront the hypocrisy. However, using a backhanded comment to suggest Annie should diet might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the comment was implied, it's a form of shaming based on weight, which is generally frowned upon. Weight-based shaming can be hurtful and doesn't address the root issue effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's behavior. But the method used might not be appropriate. Instead of a direct confrontation or reporting to authorities, the author chose a personal jab. This could be seen as inconsiderate and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. The author might have a valid concern about Annie's actions, but the response could exacerbate the situation without resolving it.\n\nThe question is whether the comment was an appropriate way to address the issue. Even if the author's intent was to show Annie the hypocrisy, the approach was not constructive. Weight shaming is generally discouraged as it can lead to defensiveness and doesn't encourage positive change. The author's actions might be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment, which is unprofessional.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment could be considered bullying or harassment, depending on the context. Even if the comment wasn't explicitly about weight, the implication was clear. The coworker didn't respond, and the daughter stopped coming to the office, which might indicate that the comment had unintended negative effects.\n\nIn summary, while Annie's actions as a parent are problematic, the author's response was a form of shaming that's generally considered inappropriate. The correct approach would be to involve proper authorities or support systems rather than making a personal jab. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
