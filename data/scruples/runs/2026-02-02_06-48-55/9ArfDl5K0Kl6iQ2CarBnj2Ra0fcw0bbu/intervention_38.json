However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the context is that the coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on an extreme diet using her college funds. The daughter is now underweight and in bad health. The author, upon witnessing this, confronted Annie by implying she should do the same program, leading to tension. The question is whether the author acted wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, Annie's actions are clearly problematic. Forcing her daughter into a harmful diet with a lot of money and causing health issues is concerning. The author's intention might have been to criticize Annie's behavior and hold her accountable. However, the method used was to target Annie's weight, which is a sensitive and personal issue. \n\nEven though the author's comment was indirect (saying the program works for Annie's daughter, implying it could work for her), it's still a form of body shaming. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making such a comment at work can be unprofessional and offensive, regardless of the intent. The author might have felt justified because of Annie's actions, but the approach could be seen as hypocritical or cruel, especially since the author is also in a position to comment on someone else's appearance.\n\nAlso, the author's main issue is Annie's hypocrisy. But using the daughter's situation to attack the mother's weight might cross a line. It's possible that the author's comment could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be appropriate. Even if the underlying situation is wrong, the method of addressing it by making a personal jab about weight is problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the author called CPS, which is a valid step if there's suspicion of abuse. But the comment itself might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author could have addressed the issue with management or HR instead of confronting Annie directly in a personal way.\n\nSo, even though the situation with Annie's daughter is terrible, the author's response was to use body shaming as a means to criticize Annie. That's likely where the author is in the wrong. The method of confrontation was inappropriate, even if the intent was to hold Annie accountable. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
