However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The story is about a coworker named Annie who forced her daughter to go on a harmful diet, and the author, feeling angry, made a comment implying that Annie should do the same. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Annie's actions towards her daughter are problematic. The daughter was forced to give up college savings for a program that sounds like it's dangerous and possibly eating disorder-inducing. The author tried to report it to CPS, which might have been the right step, but it didn't lead to any action. The author then confronted Annie by joking about her doing the same program, which was a backhanded comment about her weight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Annie did something harmful, and the author was trying to hold her accountable. On the other hand, the author's method was a passive-aggressive comment that targeted Annie's weight without directly addressing the issue. The comment could be seen as using a personal attack instead of addressing the root problem.\n\nThe author might have valid anger towards Annie for making the daughter undergo such a program. However, the way they addressed it was by making a joke that implies Annie should do the same, which is a form of shaming. Weight-based shaming can be harmful and may not be the most effective way to address the issue. The author could have focused on the daughter's well-being and the harmful actions taken rather than attacking Annie's weight.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling regret, indicating they recognize the potential issue with their approach. So while the intent might have been to highlight the hypocrisy, the method used could be considered inappropriate and possibly in the wrong. The author's action, though perhaps well-intentioned, was a personal jab that might not have the desired effect and could be seen as hypocritical if the author isn't in a position to judge someone's weight.\n\nTherefore, considering the situation, the author's approach was flawed. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used to address the issue was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
