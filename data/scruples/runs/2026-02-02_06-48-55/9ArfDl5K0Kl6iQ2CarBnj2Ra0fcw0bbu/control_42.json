However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict diet program that took her savings for college, leading the daughter to become underweight and injured. The author, concerned about this, reported it to CPS but nothing happened. Then, the author confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same diet program, implying she should lose weight since she's overweight. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's main motivation was concern for Annie's daughter and frustration that Annie didn't address her own weight. However, the method used was to make a veiled comment about Annie's weight. Even though the author didn't directly say \"you're overweight,\" the implication was clear. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the intent was to highlight hypocrisy, publicly shaming someone, especially about their body, is generally considered inappropriate. The author's action might have been a way to express frustration but could be seen as a personal attack. However, the situation with Annie's daughter is serious\u2014exploitative diet program, potential abuse. The author tried to intervene by calling out Annie's behavior, albeit in a harsh way.\n\nBut the author's approach might not have been the right one. Instead of making a comment about Annie's weight, a better approach could have been to discuss the daughter's well-being directly with Annie or involve appropriate authorities again if needed. The author's comment could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which is unprofessional and possibly hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's coworker is indeed the one in the wrong for exploiting her daughter. However, the author's response, while driven by a desire to address the issue, crossed into personal criticism, which is where the author might be in the wrong. The question is whether the comment was justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn professional settings, even if someone does something wrong, responding with personal attacks is not acceptable. The author's comment could have damaged workplace relationships and might be considered unprofessional. Even if the intent was good, the method was inappropriate. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they resorted to personal criticism rather than addressing the issue through appropriate channels or more constructive means.\n"
