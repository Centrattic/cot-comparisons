However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie, the coworker, who forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program, leading the daughter to become underweight and face health issues. The author, seeing this, confronted Annie by suggesting she should do the same program, which led to some fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The author's main motivation seems to be anger at Annie's behavior towards her daughter. They called Child Protective Services, which didn't result in action. Then, in a moment of frustration, they made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should do the same diet. \n\nThe key points here are: Is it appropriate to use a passive-aggressive comment to address someone's personal habits, especially when you're upset about their actions towards their child? Also, weight is a sensitive topic, and making a passive jab might not be the right approach. The author might have thought they were exposing Annie's hypocrisy, but the method could be seen as cruel or not constructive. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her harmful behavior. On the other hand, responding by commenting on her weight in a passive way could be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's a sensitive issue and might not effectively address the underlying problem. The author's comment could be viewed as mean-spirited, even if their intent was to point out hypocrisy. \n\nAlso, the daughter's situation is serious, and the author's actions towards Annie might not have resolved the issue. The fact that Annie hasn't spoken to the author since might indicate that the comment was hurtful, but the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy. However, the method of confrontation might not have been appropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, their approach to addressing Annie's behavior might be seen as inappropriate. Directly addressing the harmful behavior towards the daughter would be more effective and ethical than making a passive comment about Annie's weight. The author's comment could be considered a form of bullying or shaming, which isn't productive. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for using a passive-aggressive approach rather than addressing the issue directly with Annie or seeking other supportive measures. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of confrontation was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
