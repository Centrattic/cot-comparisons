However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to participate in a restrictive weight loss program using her college funds, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and unwell. The author, upset by this, made a comment implying Annie should do the same program, which led to Annie avoiding the author and the daughter not returning to the office.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author's response to witnessing potential abuse. The coworker's actions towards her daughter are questionable, possibly even abusive, as the daughter was taking out her college money and now is underweight and injured. The author called Child Protective Services, which is appropriate. However, the author's direct confrontation was a joke about Annie joining the same program. \n\nThe question is whether the author's comment was justified. While the author was trying to address the problem, using a veiled threat or sarcasm might not be the best approach. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie not applying the same program to herself, but the method might have been unprofessional or inappropriate. Telling someone they need to lose weight can be seen as offensive, regardless of the context. Additionally, the author's comment might have crossed a line by insinuating that Annie should follow a harmful program, even if it was to mirror what she did to her daughter. \n\nHowever, the author was trying to bring attention to a potential issue where Annie's actions were harmful. The comment could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive confrontation rather than a direct report. The fact that the CPS involvement didn't result in action might have led the author to seek another way to address the problem, albeit in a less than ideal manner.\n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, the author's approach was unprofessional. Instead of addressing the issue through proper channels or direct, respectful communication, they used a sarcastic remark, which could be seen as bullying or harassment. The coworker might feel targeted, especially since the comment was public or at least in a work setting. The author's actions might have contributed to a hostile work environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was genuinely concerned about the daughter's well-being and had already reported the issue. Their frustration is understandable given the situation. However, the method of addressing it by making a personal comment about Annie's weight is problematic. It's important to distinguish between the wrong action (forcing the daughter into a harmful program) and the coworker's own health. Commenting on someone's weight is generally frowned upon and can be discriminatory, regardless of the intent.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's comment was an appropriate response to the situation. While the underlying issue of the daughter's treatment is serious, the author's method of addressing it by targeting Annie's weight is not. The appropriate action would have been to continue supporting the daughter privately, perhaps through counseling or other resources, rather than making a public or veiled comment that could be seen as unprofessional or even discriminatory.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's intention was to highlight a problem but the method was flawed. They are likely in the wrong for making the comment, even if their concern was valid. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
