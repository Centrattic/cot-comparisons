However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, after seeing the negative effects on the daughter, made a comment implying Annie should join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's coworker, Annie, harmed her daughter by pressuring her into a restrictive diet that led to health issues. The author was concerned and even contacted CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author made a sarcastic remark to Annie, hoping she'd take the same program. The question is whether this response was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her actions, using the same method she used on her daughter. The comment was intended to make Annie reflect on her behavior. However, the author didn't directly confront Annie about her daughter's treatment but instead made a veiled threat. This could be seen as passive-aggressive and not addressing the core issue directly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial concern was valid. Annie's actions were harmful, and the author tried to intervene by reporting to CPS. The comment was a reaction to ongoing harmful behavior. But the method of confrontation might have been inappropriate. The author didn't have a direct conversation with Annie about the daughter's well-being, which could have been a more constructive approach. \n\nAlso, making a comment about someone's weight, especially in a public or professional setting, can be seen as discriminatory or disrespectful, regardless of intent. Even if the intention was to highlight hypocrisy, the approach might not be effective and could be harmful. The author's comment might have crossed a line, even if coming from a place of concern.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author's intentions were to address a wrong, the method used was not the best approach. The author's action could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
