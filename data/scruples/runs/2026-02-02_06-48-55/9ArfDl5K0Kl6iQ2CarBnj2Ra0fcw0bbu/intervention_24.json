However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to undergo an extreme weight loss program, which the author found troubling and took action against by calling Child Protective Services. Now, the author is questioning if they overstepped by making a sarcastic comment about Annie joining the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author did something that could be seen as a form of retaliation or a passive-aggressive jab. They made a comment that implies Annie should follow the same program she forced on her daughter. While the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy and maybe encourage Annie to address her own weight, the method used might be questionable. \n\nThe author's primary motivation stemmed from concern for Annie's daughter, which is understandable. They went to CPS because they believed the daughter was being harmed, which is a responsible action. However, their follow-up comment to Annie could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author didn't directly insult Annie's weight, the implication was clear. Telling someone to lose weight, especially in a sarcastic manner, can be hurtful and is often considered a personal attack, regardless of the context.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment might be seen as violating privacy. Annie's weight is a personal matter, and bringing it up in the workplace, even if indirectly, might not be appropriate. The author also used Annie's daughter's situation to make a point about Annie, which could be perceived as using the daughter's vulnerability as leverage against her mother. That's not a healthy dynamic, even if the author's intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was responding to what they perceived as neglect and abuse. Their actions were driven by concern for a colleague's child, which is commendable. However, the method of addressing the issue by making a jab at the mother's weight might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle it. The author could have sought other avenues, like discussing it with a supervisor or HR if CPS didn't act, instead of making a personal comment.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, making comments about someone's weight can be discriminatory. Weight discrimination is a form of discrimination in many places, and even well-intentioned comments can contribute to a hostile work environment. The author's comment, while perhaps meant to highlight a problem, could be seen as unprofessional.\n\nSo, putting this all together, even though the author's intentions were to protect the daughter and address the mother's hypocrisy, the method they chose was inappropriate. The comment about the mother's weight is likely to be seen as crossing a line, making the author at fault for making that sarcastic remark. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
