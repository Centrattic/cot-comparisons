However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author's coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author, upset by this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should also join the diet program. Now, the author is wondering if they were in the wrong for that comment.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the impact of their comment. The author's main motivation was to criticize Annie's behavior towards her daughter. The comment was indirect but had an implied jab at Annie's own weight. The question is whether this response was appropriate.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was trying to address a harmful action by Annie. However, the method used\u2014a public, sarcastic remark\u2014might be seen as a form of shaming, which could be counterproductive. Even if the author had good intentions, the comment might have escalated tension without addressing the real issue. Additionally, the author had already taken the step of calling CPS, which is a more direct and responsible action. The sarcastic comment might be seen as an unprofessional or inappropriate way to handle the situation, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for the daughter's well-being is valid. The comment might have been a way to express frustration. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method are questionable. The author could have considered other approaches, like discussing it with Annie privately or involving other authorities if necessary, rather than making a public jab.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's intention was to address a harmful act, but the method used could be seen as crossing a line. Public shaming, even if indirect, might not be the right approach. The author's comment could have been hurtful and might not lead to a constructive outcome. It's possible that the author's action was a knee-jerk reaction, driven by anger, rather than a well-thought-out strategy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their response was unprofessional and could have caused more harm than good. Even if the intent was good, the method was inappropriate. The right approach would be to address the issue through proper channels rather than making a sarcastic comment in the workplace.\n"
