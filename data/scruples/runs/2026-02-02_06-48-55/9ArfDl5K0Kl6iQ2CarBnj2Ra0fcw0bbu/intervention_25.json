However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet that led to the daughter being underweight and having health issues. The author, seeing this, confronts Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she's the one who needs to lose weight. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's coworker forced her daughter into an unhealthy diet, the author called out the coworker by suggesting she do the same, and the coworker took offense but didn't respond further. The author is seeking validation on whether they were wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. The author was concerned about the daughter's well-being and took action by contacting CPS, which didn't result in anything. Then, the author's response was to confront the coworker in a roundabout way. The coworker's actions were questionable, but the author's method of confronting her might not be appropriate.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Directly addressing someone's weight is generally a sensitive topic, especially in a professional setting. However, the coworker's actions towards her daughter were harmful. The author's intent was to point out the hypocrisy and maybe encourage the coworker to take responsibility for her own health. But the approach might have been tactless.\n\nIn such situations, the line between standing up for someone and being inconsiderate can be thin. The author had valid concerns and acted to help the daughter. However, using the coworker's own weight as a point of criticism could be seen as unkind, regardless of the intent. The question is whether the means justify the ends.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to protect the daughter and hold the coworker accountable. On the other hand, publicly implying that the coworker is overweight in a professional environment could be unprofessional and hurtful, even if the coworker herself isn't a victim here. The author's comment might come off as hypocritical or bullying, even if their intentions were good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for using a personal jab to address a serious issue. There might be better ways to approach the situation, like discussing it with a manager or HR, or continuing to support the daughter without targeting the coworker's weight. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced case where the intent was to help.\n"
