A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship from 18-23. The author mentions Rose was toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. He dropped out of college because she threatened to leave him, which seems like a major sacrifice. The breakup was messy; she left him for the roommate, who later was involved with drugs and overdosed. The author ended up homeless for a while, and Rose was allegedly violent and manipulative, even calling the cops on him when he tried to retrieve his stuff. He moved away, got his life together, married, and has a kid now. Recently, Rose called, claiming her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author told her to call the police or shelters and blocked her, not wanting her near his family. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nSo the key points here are the history of toxicity and abuse, the author's decision to cut off contact for their own well-being and family safety, and the ethical dilemma of helping someone in need despite past issues. The author has valid reasons to be cautious given Rose's manipulative behavior in the past. However, the argument could be made that if someone is in an emergency, even an ex, you should help. But considering the context of Rose's history\u2014using people, causing harm, and the author's trauma\u2014it's understandable to prioritize their family's safety. The author also directed her to appropriate resources, so they aren't ignoring the emergency entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that even if the relationship was bad, not helping in a crisis is cold. But the author's experience with Rose's manipulation and the potential risk of re-engaging makes their stance defensible. The fact that they've moved on and built a new life suggests they made a conscious choice to distance themselves. Plus, the ex's current claims could be a ploy to re-enter the author's life, given her past actions. The author isn't in a position to verify if her claim is genuine, but they can't be held responsible for that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they've had significant negative experiences justifying their decision to cut ties and protect their family, while still advising her to seek proper help.\n"
