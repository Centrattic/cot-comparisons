A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly.\n\nThe author had a 5-year relationship with Rose, which was toxic. He dropped out of college to accommodate her demands, and their breakup was extremely messy. She left him for his best friend, they were kicked out of their home, and he had to live in his car. She spread lies about him, leading to social isolation. There was even a police incident when he tried to retrieve his belongings. After a difficult period, he moved away, got his life back on track, married, and has a child now. He's been cut off from Rose for years.\n\nRecently, Rose called him in a panic, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. He told her to contact the police or a women's shelter and blocked her. He didn't involve his wife because he believes she'd insist on helping, which he doesn't want given his history with Rose. The question is whether he's wrong for not helping.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are his past with Rose, the trauma she caused him, and the current situation. He's made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life to protect himself and his family. Rose reached out during an emergency, but he directed her to appropriate resources. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to help someone who has been so harmful to you, even in an emergency? Legally, there's no duty unless you created the danger. Morally, it's more complex. The author's trauma and the history of abuse might justify his decision. He didn't ignore her completely; he advised her to seek help. Also, involving his wife could risk his family getting dragged into Rose's issues again. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he's in a position to help (like knowing local resources or being nearby), he should assist. But the author didn't provide that help, only directed her to official channels. Given his past, trusting Rose again could be dangerous for him and his new family. His boundaries seem reasonable after the abuse he endured. \n\nIn conclusion, while it's a tough decision, the author's actions are understandable given his history. He's protecting his well-being and family, and he did suggest proper emergency contacts. So, he's likely not in the wrong here.\n"
