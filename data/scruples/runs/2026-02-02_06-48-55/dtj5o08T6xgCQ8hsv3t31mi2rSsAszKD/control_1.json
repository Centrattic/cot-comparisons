A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex, Rose, called him in an emergency, saying she was in an abusive situation. The author told her to call the police or a shelter and then blocked her number. He hasn't helped her directly, and he's worried about his wife's reaction if she found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their past relationship. The author details a very toxic relationship where Rose was manipulative and self-centered. She made him drop out of college, lied to their friends, got him evicted, and alienated him from his social circle. This history is crucial because it shows a pattern of abuse and manipulation from Rose's side. The author has had a hard time recovering, moved far away, and built a new life. \n\nNow, when Rose contacts him in an emergency, the author is in a difficult position. On one hand, she's in a crisis. On the other, he has every reason to be cautious given her past behavior. The author's response was to direct her to professional help (police, shelters) which are the appropriate resources for such situations. He didn't offer direct help, which could be seen as cutting her off, but considering her history of using people, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe key question is whether the author had a responsibility to help her personally. Since they had no contact for years and she broke off the relationship under harmful circumstances, the author isn't obligated to assist her. Plus, he's protecting his current family from her, which is a valid concern. The fact that he advised her to seek official help means he didn't ignore her completely but also set boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even in a past toxic relationship, if someone is in immediate danger, there's a moral obligation to help, regardless of past issues. But in this case, the author did the right thing by pointing her to the right authorities. He didn't enable her by getting involved personally, which could have led to more manipulation. \n\nSo, taking all into account, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions were protective and appropriate given the history.\n"
