A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex, Rose, called him in a panic saying her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her number. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not helping her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the history between them. They had a five-year relationship where the author made sacrifices, like dropping out of college because she threatened to leave. The breakup was really messy, with the ex leaving him for the roommate, spreading lies, getting the police involved when he tried to retrieve his belongings. He ended up homeless for a while, moved back in with his mom, then eventually moved on, got a new life, married, had a kid. He's been cutting off contact for a while now, and even people he knew later apologized for how they treated him because they realized Rose was toxic.\n\nNow, Rose contacts him out of the blue, saying she's in an abusive situation. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her. The question is, does he have an obligation to help her despite the past?\n\nFrom one angle, if someone is in an emergency, maybe you should help regardless of past issues. But then again, if the person has a history of being toxic and manipulative, using people, and causing harm, maybe cutting contact is the right move. The author is protecting his new family and his own well-being. He's already been victimized by her before, so trusting her again might be risky. Also, advising her to contact the proper authorities (police, shelters) is still helping in a way, even if he's not personally getting involved.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a moral responsibility to help someone in distress, even if they're an ex. But if the ex has a history of manipulating and causing problems, the author might not want to get entangled again. Plus, he's concerned his wife would want to help, which could bring Rose into his new life. That's a valid concern given her past behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be justified in not helping directly but still advising the appropriate emergency services. Since he's not physically able to help and is protecting his family, it's a reasonable decision. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
