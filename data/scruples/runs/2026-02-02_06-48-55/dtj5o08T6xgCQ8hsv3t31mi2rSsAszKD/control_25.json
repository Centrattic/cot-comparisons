A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author (let's call him John) was in a 5-year relationship with Rose, which ended badly. Rose was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. John had to drop out of college because she threatened to leave him. The breakup was messy\u2014she left him for his best friend and roommate, who then kicked John out of their house. John ended up living in his car, and Rose spread lies about him, cutting him off from friends. There was even a police incident when he tried to retrieve his stuff. Eventually, John moved back in with his mom, went back to school, and now he's married with a kid. He's had no contact with Rose since.\n\nNow, recently, Rose called John in a hysterical state, claiming her new boyfriend was abusive and she had no one to turn to. John told her to contact the police or a shelter and blocked her. He hasn't told his wife because he's worried she'd insist on helping, and he doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether John was in the wrong for not helping her.\n\nSo, considering all this, there are a few angles. On one hand, Rose was in an emergency situation, and it's generally considered good to help someone in dire need. However, John has a history of being abused by Rose, both emotionally and possibly physically (though the latter isn't explicitly stated, he was accused of violence by her). The relationship was toxic, and Rose used people and then discarded them. She also lied about John, leading to his isolation and car living situation. The fact that she reached out after years of no contact, and the fact that she was involved in drug use and bad relationships, might make John wary of helping her again.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that even if Rose has been a bad person, if she's in an emergency, you should help. But others might consider the history and the fact that John has already been hurt multiple times. He's also protecting his new family now. The key points here are consent to help and the potential for further harm. John was clear that he didn't want to help and directed her to proper resources. He didn't ignore her in a way that endangered her life (like if she was about to die and he had the means to help). Instead, he provided the appropriate channels. \n\nRose could have called the police or a shelter herself. John's action was to refuse personal help and not enable a toxic relationship. Since he was already cut off from her and the situation wasn't a direct threat to her life (as he didn't have her in the same location), directing her to official help is reasonable. Also, considering the history, trusting her and getting involved again could be risky for John and his family.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But given the context, John's refusal to help personally isn't necessarily wrong. He's protected his family and boundary, and the emergency could be addressed through other means. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
