A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The story is pretty detailed. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship. They mention that Rose was toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy, and Rose left the author for the best friend and their roommate. The author had a tough time, living out of their car, being called by Rose to get things, and even had a legal issue when trying to retrieve belongings. Eventually, the author moved away, got their life together, married, had a kid, and built a new life.\n\nNow, Rose contacts the author with an emergency\u2014her boyfriend is abusive, and she needs help. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The author hasn't told their wife about this, partly because they don't want Rose near their family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, when someone is in danger, especially domestic abuse, people might feel there's an obligation to help. But the author has a history of trauma with Rose, and she's been manipulative and harmful in the past. The author has made a conscious decision to cut ties and protect their current family. \n\nIs there an ethical duty to help someone in an emergency, even if they've been abusive? In many cases, especially involving immediate danger, the recommended action is to contact authorities or emergency services. The author directed Rose to those resources. However, some might argue that because they knew her personally, there's a responsibility to assist in some way, like calling the police for her or ensuring she gets help.\n\nBut the author's experience with Rose is very negative. They were gaslighted, manipulated, and alienated. The author has moved on and is in a stable, happy situation. Introducing Rose back into their life could jeopardize that. The author might not want to enable her again or risk their family's safety, especially if Rose is manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author did give Rose the correct advice: call the police or a shelter. The issue is whether they should have done more. But how much can someone be expected to help a former toxic partner, especially when there's a history of abuse towards them? The author isn't ignoring a stranger in distress but someone who has caused them significant harm.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whether the author's actions are unjustifiable. Since they provided the necessary steps for Rose to get help and refused to engage further, which protects their own family, it could be seen as reasonable. The author isn't ignoring the emergency but is directing her to appropriate help. The key point is that the author isn't preventing her from getting help; they're just not personally involved.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for not wanting to help directly, especially given Rose's history. They did the responsible thing by advising her to contact authorities. The author's choice to protect their family and not re-engage with a toxic person is understandable. The real issue is whether there's a moral obligation beyond their personal boundaries, which the author has clearly set.\n"
