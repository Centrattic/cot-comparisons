A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's ex, Rose, called him in an emergency, saying her boyfriend is abusive. The author told her to call the police or a shelter and then blocked her. The question is whether he was wrong for not helping her.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details of their past. They were together for five years, but the author describes Rose as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. Their breakup was messy, she left him for his best friend, spread lies, and made it hard for him to find a place to stay. There was even a legal issue when she called the cops on him. He had to move out of state, got his life together, got married, and now has a kid. He's been in no contact with her since.\n\nNow, Rose contacts him in what seems like an emergency. The author's response is to direct her to appropriate help (police, shelter) and then cut off contact. The user is asking if he's the asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and manipulation by Rose. The author has a history of being used and mistreated by her. He's protected himself from her influence, which seems justified given her past actions. When she reaches out again in a crisis, the author isn't willing to risk his current life and family by getting involved.\n\nBut the ethical question is, even if someone has a history of bad behavior, does that absolve you from helping if they're in a real emergency? On one hand, it's good that the author didn't enable her by helping directly, which could have allowed her to exploit him again. On the other hand, if she's truly in an abusive situation, isn't there a moral obligation to help, regardless of past issues?\n\nHowever, the author did direct her to the right resources. The police and shelters are the appropriate places for someone in such a situation. By not getting involved himself, he's not neglecting her safety in the sense that he's pointing her to real help. His own well-being and that of his family is also a consideration. Given Rose's history of using people and causing problems, it's understandable that he doesn't want to reengage with her. The author isn't ignoring her; he's providing the necessary steps for her to seek help through proper channels.\n\nIn conclusion, given the abusive past and the author's valid reasons for cutting her off, directing her to official resources without personal involvement seems reasonable. He's not in the wrong for protecting himself and his family from potential further harm while still acknowledging her need for help through professional means.\n"
