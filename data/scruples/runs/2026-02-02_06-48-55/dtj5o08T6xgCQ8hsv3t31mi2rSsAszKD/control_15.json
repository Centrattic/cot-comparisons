A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the relationship history: they were together for five years, from 18 to 23. The ex, Rose, is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author made sacrifices, like dropping out of college because Rose threatened to leave. The breakup was messy\u2014Rose left for the author's best friend and roommate, which led to the author being kicked out of their home and living in their car. The ex spread lies about the author being violent, causing friends to reject them. The author had to deal with the police being called, and after six months, moved back with their mom and eventually got back on track, got married, had a kid.\n\nNow, Rose contacts the author out of the blue, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she's scared, asking for help. The author told her to contact the police or a shelter and blocked her. The author is concerned about their wife and kid, not wanting Rose to be near them. They haven't told their wife because she's kind and would insist on helping, which the author doesn't want.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to weigh the context. The ex has a history of being manipulative and toxic, using people. She's had issues with drug use and abusive relationships. The author has cut contact to protect themselves and their family. When approached, the author directed her to emergency services and then cut contact. \n\nOn one hand, if someone is in an emergency, maybe the instinct is to help. But the author has good reasons not to engage: past manipulation, potential danger, protecting their family. They also advised her to contact the proper authorities. The author's actions were to block and not help further, which they did for self-protection and family's safety. \n\nI think the key points are the history of toxicity and the author's right to set boundaries. Even if Rose was in a bad situation, the author isn't responsible for helping her, especially given the past. They did the right thing by directing her to official help. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
