A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty detailed. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a five-year relationship ending in a messy break-up. He mentions she's toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. He made sacrifices, like dropping out of college because she threatened to leave. After the breakup, she left him for his roommate, spread lies, got him kicked out, and called the cops when he tried to get his stuff. He ended up living in his car and moved back in with his mom. Now, years later, he's married with a kid and hasn't had contact with her. \n\nRecently, she called him in a hysterical state, claiming her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her. He's worried about involving his wife because he knows she's kind and might help, but he doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether he's the asshole for not helping.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Rose was abusive and manipulative in the past, cutting him off from friends and family. He's protecting his new life and family. On the other hand, she's in a potential emergency situation. But the author is not obligated to help someone who has wronged him so badly. He directed her to appropriate resources (police, shelters) which are the right steps. Blocking her is a way to cut off further contact, which makes sense given their history.\n\nThe key points are his past experiences with her, the protection of his current family, and the fact that he provided the correct emergency response. While it's hard to turn someone away in need, given her history of using people and causing harm, his actions seem justified. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his safety and that of his family, and he did offer the necessary help through official channels. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
