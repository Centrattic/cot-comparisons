A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by not helping his ex during an emergency. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship from ages 18-23. He dropped out of college because she threatened to leave him. The breakup was messy; she left him for his best friend, who was also their roommate, and they kicked him out. He ended up homeless for a while, and she spread lies about him, leading to his isolation. He eventually moved back with his mom, got married, had a kid, and is now in a better place. \n\nNow, Rose contacts him out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. He didn't tell his wife because he's afraid she'd want to help Rose, and he wants to protect his family. \n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and toxicity in the relationship. Rose was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. She manipulated the author into dropping out of college, spread lies about him, and caused his homelessness. She also used people until they were no longer useful. The author has moved on, reconnected with friends after being isolated, and now has a family.\n\nWhen Rose reaches out, she's in a difficult situation, but the author has valid reasons not to trust her. He's protecting himself and his family from potential harm. He advised her to contact official emergency services, which is the appropriate course of action. By not getting directly involved, he's not helping her directly but is directing her to the right resources. Blocking her number is a way to maintain boundaries after a history of abuse.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Arguing for A (he's in the wrong) would say that someone in need should be helped regardless of past issues. However, considering the extensive history of manipulation and abuse, it's understandable that he's cautious. He's not ignoring her entirely but is giving her the right resources. Arguing for B (he's not in the wrong) would focus on his right to protect himself and his family from someone who has historically been abusive.\n\nThe line between helping someone in need and protecting oneself from potential harm is thin here. Since the author took the step to inform her of official help and then set boundaries, it seems more like self-protection than neglect. The key factors are the past abuse and the potential for Rose to be manipulative again. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
