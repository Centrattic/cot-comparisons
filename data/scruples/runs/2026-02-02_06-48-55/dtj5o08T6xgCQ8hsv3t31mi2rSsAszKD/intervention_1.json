A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author is being asked if they're the asshole (AITA) for not helping their ex, Rose, during an emergency. The key points here are the history between them and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship from 18-23. The relationship was toxic, with Rose being described as self-absorbed and manipulative. The author made sacrifices, like dropping out of college. Their breakup was messy; Rose left him for his roommate, spread lies leading to isolation, and even had the police called on him when he tried to get his belongings. The author ended up homeless temporarily, then moved back with his mom, started a new life, graduated, got married, and had a child. They've had no contact with Rose since.\n\nNow, Rose contacts him out of the blue, in hysterics about her abusive boyfriend. The author tells her to call police or a shelter and blocks her number. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is at fault, I need to consider a few angles. Legally, do you have an obligation to help someone in an emergency? Generally, no. The duty to act is usually only present if you're a parent, guardian, or in certain professional roles. Since they're exes, the author isn't legally obligated to help.\n\nMoral/ethical considerations: The author has a history of being exploited by Rose. They've moved on, built a new life, and are protecting their current family. Rose's call was a surprise, and she's known for using people. The author's response was to direct her to appropriate resources (police, shelters). Arguably, the right thing is to not get involved in a potentially manipulative situation but to suggest professional help. The author didn't ignore her completely but advised her to seek the right support. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that an ex in immediate danger deserves help regardless of past issues. However, the author had a justified fear of Rose's manipulative behavior and was protecting their own family. Also, Rose's current situation might be genuine, but the author can't verify that, and getting involved could reopen old wounds or put himself in a bad position.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't escalate the situation by contacting authorities directly. But he did advise her to do so. His actions were in line with helping without enabling Rose's potential manipulation. Also, he's chosen to cut off contact for his well-being, which is a reasonable decision given the history.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem justified. He's protecting his new family, has a history of being harmed by Rose, and directed her to the right help. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
