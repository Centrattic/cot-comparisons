A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex. The author had a toxic 5-year relationship with Rose, who was manipulative and caused a lot of problems in his life. After the breakup, he moved on, got married, had a kid, and cut all ties. Now, years later, Rose calls him in a panic about her abusive boyfriend and asks for help, but he refuses, telling her to contact authorities instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their past. Rose was clearly toxic and self-serving. She manipulated the author into dropping out of college and later spread lies that led to him being isolated. After their breakup, she continued to cause trouble by involving the police when he tried to retrieve his belongings. This history shows a pattern of abuse and control.\n\nNow, when Rose reaches out in an emergency, the author's immediate reaction is to tell her to call the police or a shelter. He also blocks her number and hasn't informed his wife. His reasoning is that he's protected himself and his new family from her toxic influence. He's also aware that Rose tends to use people until they're of no use.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that refusing help in an emergency could be seen as inhumane, especially if the person is in genuine danger. However, given the history, the author is protecting himself from emotional and potential physical harm. He's made a conscious decision to cut ties for his well-being and that of his family. By directing her to professional help, he's still offering a solution without getting involved personally.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the author's right to self-preservation, and the availability of appropriate resources. Since the author didn't ignore her but suggested official help, his actions seem justified. He's not neglecting her in the sense of not providing any assistance, just not involving himself personally. Therefore, it seems like he's not in the wrong because he's prioritizing his safety and the safety of his family, especially given her past behavior.\n"
