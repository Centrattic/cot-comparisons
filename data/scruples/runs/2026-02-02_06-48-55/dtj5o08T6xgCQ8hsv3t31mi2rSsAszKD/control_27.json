A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author (AITA) was in a 5-year relationship with Rose, who is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. Their breakup was really messy\u2014she left him for his best friend, they got kicked out of their house, he ended up homeless for a while because she spread lies. There was even a police incident when he tried to get his stuff back. He had to move away, restart his life, went to college, married, had a kid. Now he's in his 30s, and he's had no contact with Rose since. She's been in and out of bad situations, including drug use and a breakup with an abusive boyfriend who OD'd. \n\nRecently, Rose called him, out of the blue, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. He told her to call the police or a women's shelter and then blocked her. He didn't help and didn't tell his wife. The question is whether he's the asshole for not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship history. The user was in a very toxic relationship where the ex was manipulative and caused significant harm. He was the victim of her actions, being isolated, homeless, and publicly shamed. That's pretty bad. \n\nNow, in the present, she's in an emergency. But is it the author's responsibility to help? He's moved on with his life, has a family now, and has legitimate reasons to cut her out due to her past behavior. The key here is that the author is not ignoring someone in distress without reason; he's making a decision based on his history with her. \n\nBut wait, if someone is in an emergency, like domestic abuse, the general expectation is to get professional help. The author directed her to the police and the shelter, which are the appropriate resources. He didn't disregard her situation entirely\u2014just refused to be her personal helper. \n\nAlso, considering that Rose had a history of using people and then discarding them, and that she might not be trustworthy (given her past lies and manipulation), the author is protecting himself and his family. Telling his wife might lead her to get involved in a dangerous situation with someone who has a history of being toxic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if someone has a bad past, if they're currently in a life-threatening situation, you have a moral obligation to help. But the author is not ignoring; he's advising her to use the right channels. Also, given their history, he's protecting himself from being dragged into her problems again. \n\nThe line between being a reasonable person and the asshole is thin here. But the key points are that he did offer the correct resources, he's not in a position where he's obligated to help her personally, and his past experiences justify his caution. \n\nSo the answer is probably B (Not the asshole). He's not wrong for prioritizing his safety and family, and directing her to the appropriate help. His actions are responsible given the context.\n"
