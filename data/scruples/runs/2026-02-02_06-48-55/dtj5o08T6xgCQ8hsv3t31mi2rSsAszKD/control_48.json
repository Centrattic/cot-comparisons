A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about not helping an ex who said she was in an emergency. The author had a really toxic 5-year relationship with Rose, which ended messily. Rose left him for his roommate, spread lies, got the police involved, and he ended up homeless for a while. Since then, he's moved on, got married, had a kid, and hasn't had contact with Rose.\n\nNow, Rose calls him out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her. The question is whether that's asshole behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was clearly abused by Rose in the past\u2014both emotionally and in terms of how she treated him during the breakup. She's been manipulative, using people, and has a history of causing problems. The author also mentions he's worried that if his wife knows, she'd want to help, and he doesn't want Rose near his family. \n\nOn one hand, not helping someone in an emergency could seem harsh. But Rose has a history of being toxic and using people. The author might be protecting himself from getting dragged back into a harmful situation. Also, the proper course of action for someone in an emergency is to contact authorities or shelters, not personal contacts. The author directed her to those resources, which is the right thing to do. \n\nHe also hasn't had contact in years, so it's understandable he doesn't want to re-engage. The fact that his wife and kid are a priority makes sense, and he's trying to protect them from Rose's influence. \n\nBut wait, is there a responsibility to help even if someone is toxic? Like, if someone is in immediate danger, should you ignore it just because of past issues? However, the author is not in a position where he can be held responsible for her safety anymore. They're not in a relationship, and he's not her family. Plus, he's not in a place where he can intervene without risking his own family's safety. \n\nAlso, by telling her to call the police or a shelter, he's encouraging her to seek the appropriate help. Blocking her number is a way to prevent further contact, which he's decided long ago. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions seem justified. He's protecting himself and his new family from someone who has a history of being harmful. He didn't ignore her in the sense of not giving any advice, but he also set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
