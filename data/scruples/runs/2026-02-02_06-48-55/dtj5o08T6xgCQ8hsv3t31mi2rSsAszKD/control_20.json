A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who we'll call AITA, had a 5-year relationship with Rose, who's described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. Their breakup was very messy. Rose left AITA for his best friend and roommate, who then kicked AITA out of their house. AITA ended up living in his car after being isolated and lied about by Rose. There were legal issues when he tried to retrieve his stuff. Eventually, he moved back with his mom, went to college, got married, and had a kid. He's been in no contact with Rose for years. From what he gathered, Rose's subsequent relationships were problematic, and her ex-roommate overdosed on drugs.\n\nRecently, Rose called AITA, now in his city, and claimed her new boyfriend was abusive and she needed help. AITA told her to contact the police or a shelter and blocked her. He didn't tell his wife because he doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether he's an asshole for not helping her during an emergency.\n\nSo, the key points here are: AITA has a history of being hurt and manipulated by Rose. He's cut off contact to protect himself and his new family. Rose reached out in what she says is an emergency, but AITA didn't help and instead directed her to professional resources. \n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. On one hand, if someone is in true danger, there's a societal expectation that people might help, especially if they have a past relationship. But on the other hand, Rose has a history of being toxic and manipulating people, including getting AITA evicted and lied about. AITA might have valid reasons to not trust her and to protect his new life. By telling her to contact the police or shelter, he's directing her to appropriate emergency services, which are better equipped to handle such situations than an ex-partner.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of whether he should have at least listened or offered some support. However, given the history of abuse and manipulation from Rose, AITA's choice to cut contact makes sense for self-preservation. Forcing him to help someone who has wronged him so severely could be seen as unfair. Also, he's already given her the necessary advice\u2014calling authorities\u2014which is the right step in any case of domestic abuse.\n\nAnother angle: the user's wife's reaction. He didn't tell her, perhaps because he knows she's compassionate and might push for helping Rose, which could conflict with his decision to keep Rose out of his life. That shows he's considering his wife's nature but also protecting his family from potential negative interactions with Rose.\n\nBut is there a possibility that Rose is in genuine trouble and AITA is cutting her off just because of past issues? Maybe. But given the context, AITA has been through significant trauma with Rose. It's possible that this is another manipulation tactic from Rose, using an \"emergency\" to get back into his life. AITA is in a stable, happy situation now, and giving Rose any access could jeopardize that.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a responsible decision by not engaging and instead directing her to the appropriate resources. His actions don't make him an asshole because he's protecting his well-being and family while still providing the correct emergency response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
