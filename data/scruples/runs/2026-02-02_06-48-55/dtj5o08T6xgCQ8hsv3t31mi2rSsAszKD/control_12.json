A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation seems pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship from ages 18-23. The author dropped out of college because Rose threatened to leave. The breakup was messy; Rose left him for his roommate, who then kicked him out and called the police, leading to him living out of his car. He was isolated, and after six months, moved back with his mom and rebuilt his life, getting married and having a kid. He's been no contact with Rose since and heard she's been into drugs, abusive relationships, etc.\n\nNow, recently, Rose called him, probably through someone who gave her his number. She claimed her new boyfriend was abusive and she was scared, needing help. The author told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her. He didn't want his wife involved because she's kind and might help, but he doesn't want Rose near his family.\n\nSo the question is, is he the asshole for not helping? Let's consider the dynamics. Rose has a history of being toxic, manipulative, and using people. She previously lied about the author to friends, leading to his social isolation. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially after being wronged. Helping her might risk his family's safety or being drawn back into a toxic situation. However, if her emergency was real, some might argue he should help regardless of past issues.\n\nBut the key points here are the ex's history of manipulation and the author's justified fear. He had a valid reason to not engage, given her past behavior. Also, he directed her to appropriate resources (police, shelters) which are better equipped to handle such emergencies than he would be. The author's decision to cut contact and protect his current life makes sense. The wife's kindness is a factor he's trying to protect too. \n\nIt's possible that Rose is manipulating the situation again, but the author can't be expected to verify that in the moment. Given the history, not helping isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is probably B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his well-being and safety over someone who's shown harmful tendencies.\n"
