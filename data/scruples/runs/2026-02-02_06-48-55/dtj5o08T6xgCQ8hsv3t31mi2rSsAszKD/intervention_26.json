A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis based on the story provided.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author and his ex (Rose) had a 5-year relationship from 18-23. He dropped out of college because she threatened to leave for someone who would spend more time with her. The breakup was messy; she left him for his best friend, who they also lived with. After the breakup, he was kicked out of the house, had to live in his car, and when he tried to get his stuff, the ex and her new partner called the cops. It took six months of isolation, then he moved back in with his mom, graduated, married, and had a kid. Since then, no contact with Rose, who they say is toxic, self-absorbed, and uses people. His friends later apologized after realizing Rose's behavior. The ex's ex-boyfriend overdosed on drugs, and now she's in the same city and called him in an emergency, saying her boyfriend is abusive. He told her to call police or shelters and blocked her, not wanting to involve his wife and family.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex in an emergency. The user thinks he is, but wants to know. \n\nLooking at the situation: The author has a history of being manipulated and harmed by Rose. He's made the decision to cut her out of his life for his well-being and his family's. When she calls in a crisis, he advises her to contact the appropriate authorities and then blocks her to maintain distance. \n\nOn one hand, if someone is in an emergency, there's a societal expectation to help, but the author's past experiences are significant. He's likely protecting himself from further harm and ensuring that his new family isn't involved with a toxic person. On the other hand, some might argue that even if the person is toxic, if there's an emergency, he should offer some form of help, even if it's just connecting her to the right resources.\n\nBut the author did direct her to the right places (police, shelters) which are the appropriate responses for such situations. He didn't ignore her but gave her the necessary advice and then maintained his boundaries. Since he's already moved on and has a family now, it's reasonable to protect his current life. Plus, Rose's history of using people might make the author hesitant to get involved again. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and manipulation, the author's right to set boundaries, and the fact that he provided a solution (contacting authorities) rather than ignoring the call. The fact that he didn't want to involve his wife and child also shows he's considering their safety. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his own well-being and his family's, and he did give her the right advice. The answer should be B.\n"
