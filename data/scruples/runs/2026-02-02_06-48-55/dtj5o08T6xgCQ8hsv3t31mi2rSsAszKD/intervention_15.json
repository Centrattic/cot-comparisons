A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a 5-year relationship with Rose, who was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. During the relationship, Rose threatened to leave unless he dropped out of college. Their breakup was messy; she left him for his roommate, who then kicked him out. He ended up homeless, and Rose spread lies, leading to the police being called when he tried to retrieve his belongings. He eventually moved back in with his mom and started college again, now married with a kid.\n\nNow, a couple of days ago, Rose called him in a hysterical state, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. He told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her number. He hasn't told his wife because he's afraid she'd insist on helping, and he wants to keep his family away from Rose. The question is, is he the asshole for not helping?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author has a past of being victimized by Rose's toxic behavior, which included abandoning him, spreading lies, and causing legal issues. He's now in a stable, happy life with a family and has made a conscious decision to cut off contact with Rose. On the other hand, Rose is in an abusive situation and reached out to someone, even if that person was a former partner.\n\nBut is he obligated to help her? People can have emergency situations, but that doesn't mean the person they reach out to has to assist. The author had a history of being used and lied to by Rose. He prioritized his family's safety and his own well-being by not engaging. Also, the appropriate response for an emergency is to contact authorities or shelters, which he did mention. Helping someone in an emergency usually involves immediate, direct assistance, but the author didn't provide that, instead directing her to the right resources.\n\nAnother angle: after the trauma Rose caused, is it reasonable for the author to cut her off completely? It seems like he's protecting his current life from someone who has shown harmful behavior. People can make mistakes in their past, but Rose's actions were malicious. The author isn't ignoring her in a non-emergency context but is setting a boundary based on prior experiences. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even ex-partners should be helped in emergencies. But if the ex is known to be manipulative and has a history of causing harm, it's understandable to avoid contact. The author's decision to block her and not involve his wife could be seen as protecting his family from potential toxicity.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. He's made a conscious choice to distance himself after being wronged, and he's not neglecting her by not taking action. Instead, he's encouraging her to seek proper help. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
