A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a five-year relationship, but it sounds like it was toxic. The ex is described as self-absorbed and spiteful. There were major issues during their breakup, including her leaving him for his best friend, spreading lies that led to him being isolated, and even getting the cops called on him when he tried to retrieve his belongings. This caused him to live in his car and move back in with his mom. Now he's moved on, married, and has a kid. He's made a conscious decision to cut off contact with her, especially after she used people and got involved with drugs.\n\nNow, a few years later, she calls him in a panic, saying her current boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and then blocks her. He hasn't told his wife because he's worried about her being kind and wanting to help, which he doesn't want. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not helping.\n\nSo, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, is there an obligation to help someone in an emergency? Generally, the law doesn't require you to help unless you created the danger (like if you were the one who harmed them). But ethically, it can be more complex. However, in this case, the author has a history of being mistreated by her, and she's someone who's caused him a lot of harm. The author has made a decision to cut her out of his life for his own well-being and that of his family.\n\nAnother angle is whether there's a moral duty. If someone you knew was in danger, even if they were a previous partner, do you have a responsibility to help? But given the history of abuse and manipulation from the ex, the author might be justified in not wanting to get involved. Also, the ex's current situation might be an opportunity for her to seek the help she needs through proper channels rather than relying on someone she's previously wronged.\n\nIt's also important to consider the author's right to set boundaries. After a toxic relationship and being cut off from friends, he's rebuilt his life. Allowing her back in could jeopardize his current relationships and mental health. He's not ignoring an emergency by not providing direct help; he's directing her to the appropriate resources (police, shelters). That seems responsible because he's not enabling her while still giving her the necessary information to seek help.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while it might feel harsh, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his own well-being and that of his family, and he's not neglecting her situation by not telling her where to go for help. The key point is that he's not ignoring the emergency but redirecting her to the correct authorities. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
