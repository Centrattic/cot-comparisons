A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's ex, Rose, called him in an emergency, claiming her boyfriend is abusive and she needed help. But the author told her to call the police or a shelter and then blocked her number.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Rose were in a toxic relationship for years. The author made a lot of sacrifices for her, including dropping out of college, and then was treated extremely poorly after the breakup. Rose's actions led to the author being homeless for a while, getting evicted, and being cut off from friends. There's a history of abuse and manipulation from Rose's side, including lying about the author to others, calling the police on him when he was just trying to retrieve his stuff, and her using people until they're no longer useful.\n\nNow, the current situation is that Rose is in an emergency, possibly an abusive situation. The author's response was to tell her to contact the appropriate authorities and not to contact him again. He also mentions that he hasn't told his wife because she's kind and would want to help, which the author doesn't want Rose near his family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. On one hand, Rose is in a dire situation, and the author could be seen as cutting her off without support. But on the other hand, the author has a history of being severely abused by Rose, both emotionally and by her actions causing his homelessness and isolation. The author has made a conscious decision to cut all ties to protect himself and his new family. \n\nI think the key points here are the history of abuse and the author's right to protect himself. While it's true that Rose is in an emergency, the author is not responsible for her well-being after the breakup, especially given her past behavior. He directed her to the right resources and made it clear not to contact him again. The author's actions seem self-protective, which is reasonable given his past experiences. The fact that he has a new family to protect adds another layer where he needs to avoid any potential conflict or harm from Rose.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even with a toxic past, if someone is in an emergency, you should help. But in this case, the author is not ignoring the emergency by not helping; he's advising her to contact the right people. The author's decision not to re-engage is about setting boundaries, which is a healthy choice after such a damaging relationship. So, considering the context, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
