A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and their ex, Rose, were together for five years when they were young. The author dropped out of college because Rose threatened to leave them for someone else who would spend more time with her. The breakup was messy, with Rose leaving the author for their roommate and then spreading lies about them, leading to the author being kicked out of their home and living in their car. The author faced a lot of hardship, including the police being called when they tried to retrieve their stuff. Eventually, they moved back with their mom, went back to college, got married, and started a family. They've had no contact with Rose for years and tried to block her out completely.\n\nNow, a few years later, Rose contacts the author in an emergency, saying her new boyfriend is abusive. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and then blocks her. The author is worried about their wife and child, thinking their wife would want to help and that Rose might exploit their kindness. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nI need to consider the concept of \"asshole\" here. The author has a history of being deeply hurt by Rose's toxic behavior. They made sacrifices and were treated poorly, leading to isolation and even legal issues when trying to get their belongings. The key point is that the author has decided to cut off all contact for their own well-being and the safety of their family. \n\nWhen Rose calls for help, the author advises her to seek appropriate resources, which they did. They didn't ignore her but directed her to the right places. The author is in a position where they have rebuilt their life and are protecting it from someone who has a history of manipulation and deceit. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some would argue that the author should have helped, given the past relationship. But given the context of Rose's toxic history, including lying about abuse (when the author was actually being alienated and had to live in their car), it's possible she might be using false claims again. The author's actions were to prevent potential harm to their family and themselves, especially after being burned before.\n\nSo, the author isn't helping, but they are advising her to contact proper authorities. They are not ignoring the emergency but setting boundaries. Since Rose was known for being self-absorbed and manipulative, the author is justified in not trusting her and not wanting to get involved. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
