A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex-girlfriend during an emergency. The situation is complex because of their past.\n\nFirst, the author had a toxic 5-year relationship with Rose. She was emotionally abusive, caused him to drop out of college, and led to him living in his car. She spread lies, got him evicted, and cut him off from friends. He eventually moved away, rebuilt his life, married, and has a kid now. He hasn't had contact with her for years.\n\nNow, she calls him in a hysterical state saying her boyfriend is abusive. He tells her to contact the police or a shelter and blocks her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Rose's past behavior suggests manipulation and self-centeredness. She used people, had a history of substance abuse, and the relationship was clearly harmful. The author is justified in wanting to cut her out of his life to protect himself and his family. He provided advice (call police/shelter) which are appropriate emergency contacts. He didn't ignore her outright; he directed her to the right resources. Blocking her number makes sense to prevent further contact.\n\nOn the other hand, someone in an emergency might need more support than just being told to call police. But given the history, the author isn't in a position to help without opening himself up to manipulation again. He also knows his wife would be kind, which is why he didn't involve her, to protect his family from Rose's potential manipulation.\n\nRose's claim about the abusive boyfriend needs verification. If it's true, she should be getting help through proper channels. But if she's faking it to get him to help, then the author is protecting himself. Given her past, there's a risk she's exaggerating or lying again.\n\nSo, the author did the right thing by not engaging further and directing her to the appropriate resources. He's not obligated to help someone who has caused him so much harm. His actions were self-protective and responsible, considering their history. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
