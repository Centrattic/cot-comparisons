A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and Rose were in a toxic 5-year relationship. The ex is described as self-absorbed and spiteful. The breakup was messy, with Rose leaving the author for his best friend and roommate. The author ended up homeless for a while because of her actions. There were legal issues and social alienation. Now, the author has moved on, married, and has a kid. He's been in contact with Rose for years. \n\nRecently, Rose called him in hysterics, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author told her to contact the police or a shelter and blocked her number. He didn't involve his wife because he's afraid she'd want to help and he doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether he's the asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here. On one hand, Rose was in an abusive situation and reached out for help. On the other hand, she has a history of being toxic, manipulating, and causing harm. The author has valid reasons to be cautious, especially after past experiences where she lied and endangered his safety. He did direct her to appropriate resources, which are the right steps for emergencies. Blocking her number is about protecting himself and his family from potential further manipulation or contact.\n\nBut some might argue that even with a toxic past, if someone is in immediate danger, you should help. However, the author didn't ignore her entirely\u2014he advised her to contact authorities. The line between helping and enabling is important here. Given Rose's history, helping in a way that could be exploited (like letting her stay with them) would be risky. The author's priority is his family's safety, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between compassion and self-preservation. The author provided the necessary emergency contacts and then set boundaries. Not helping directly isn't the same as not offering any assistance. So, considering the context, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his safety and that of his family after such a traumatic experience. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
