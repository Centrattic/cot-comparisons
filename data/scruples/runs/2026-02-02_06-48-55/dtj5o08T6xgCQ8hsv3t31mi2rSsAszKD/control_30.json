A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a 5-year relationship with Rose, which ended messily. Rose was described as toxic and self-absorbed. They broke up when Rose left the author for his best friend, leading to a lot of personal issues for the author, like living in his car, being isolated, and even having the police called on him. Now, the author is 32, married, with a kid, and has moved on with his life. He's had no contact with Rose for years, and she's been involved in drug-related issues. \n\nRecently, Rose called him in a panic, saying her new boyfriend was abusive and she needed help. The author told her to contact the police or a shelter and blocked her number. He hasn't told his wife because he's worried she'd insist on helping, and he wants to keep Rose away from his family. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider a few factors. First, the history between them. The author clearly had a very negative experience with Rose, who was abusive and manipulative in their past relationship. She also spread lies to isolate him, which is serious. The author has every reason to be cautious, given her history of using people and then discarding them. \n\nNext, the current situation. Rose called him in an emergency, but the author's main concern is protecting himself and his family from her. He directed her to appropriate resources (police, shelters) which are the standard channels for such emergencies. He didn't ignore her completely; he gave her advice on how to seek help through official means. His refusal to engage further is based on his past trauma and the desire to protect his new life. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while it's true that someone in distress might need help, the author isn't obligated to personally assist, especially given the toxic history. It's reasonable to direct someone to the right resources and not involve oneself if there's a history of harm. Additionally, the author is trying to protect his family from someone who has caused him significant pain. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even ex-partners have a basic responsibility to help in emergencies. But considering the nature of their past relationship and Rose's behavior, it's a judgment call. The author did provide the necessary advice and then set boundaries. \n\nI think the key points here are the history of abuse and manipulation, the author's legitimate reasons for not wanting to help, and the fact that he directed her to proper help. So, the author isn't in the wrong; he acted appropriately given his past experiences and the current context.\n"
