A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author had a 5-year relationship with Rose, who's described as toxic and self-absorbed. He dropped out of college to accommodate her demands, and the breakup was really bad. She left him for the roommate, spread lies about him being violent, leading to him living in his car and being isolated. The police were called when he tried to retrieve his stuff. He eventually moved back in with his mom, started school again, and now he's married with a kid. They've had no contact for years. \n\nNow, Rose calls out of the blue, hysterical, claiming her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her. He's worried his wife would try to help if she knew, so he's keeping it secret. The question is whether he's the asshole for not assisting her.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author has a history of being wronged by Rose. She manipulated and isolated him, even lied about him. It's possible she's using similar tactics now. The fact that he's already made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life, given her past behavior, is significant. \n\nHowever, in an emergency situation, the instinct might be to help, even someone you don't like. But the author is protecting his family and himself, which is understandable. He's not in a position to help someone who has a history of using people. Also, Rose's new boyfriend's drug issues and their previous breakup suggest she might not have a stable support system. But the author has legitimate reasons to be cautious. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Rose's history of toxicity and manipulation, 2) The author's past trauma and need for closure, 3) The emergency's authenticity\u2014does the author have any reason to believe she's genuine this time? 4) The existence of official resources like police and shelters that are appropriate for such situations.\n\nSince the author directed her to those resources and chose not to get involved to protect his family, his actions seem justified. He's not the one causing harm now. The wife's kindness is a valid concern, but the author is making a choice based on past experiences. There's no indication he knew the call was a genuine emergency, and he's not responsible for her current situation. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong. He's protecting himself after being harmed before. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when the person has a history of using others and he's already moved on with his life.\n"
