A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author had a toxic 5-year relationship with Rose. She's described as self-absorbed and spiteful. There were major issues like her causing him to drop out of college, a messy breakup where she left him for his roommate, leading to him living in his car and legal troubles. He eventually moved away, rebuilt his life, got married, and has a kid. Since then, he's had no contact with Rose. She's had a bad track record, involving drugs and abusive relationships.\n\nNow, the recent incident: Rose contacts him in a panic, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. He hasn't told his wife because he's worried she'd insist on helping, and he doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether he's an asshole for not helping.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the history of abuse and toxicity. Rose has a pattern of manipulating and using people. The author has legitimate reasons to be cautious. He's protected himself and his new family by cutting off contact. When Rose reaches out in what might be an emergency, he's in a position where he can't risk getting involved again. \n\nBut wait, is it his responsibility to help? Legally, unless he's a close family member or has a duty of care, he's not obligated. Ethically, it's more complex. If she's in real danger, maybe the right thing is to encourage her to contact authorities. The author did that, which is the immediate action. But some might argue that he could have done more, like contacting a shelter or social services anonymously. However, given his history, trusting her might be dangerous. \n\nAlso, the fact that she had her number despite him blocking contact before suggests she might have other ways to reach him, which is a red flag. The author's priority is his family's safety and his own well-being. He's not in a position to help someone who has a history of harming him and others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He took the appropriate steps by directing her to the right resources and cutting off contact to protect himself. His past experiences justify his decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
