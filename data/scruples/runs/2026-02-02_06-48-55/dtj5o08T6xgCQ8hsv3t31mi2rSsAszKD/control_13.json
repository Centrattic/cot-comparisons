A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship when they were young. The ex is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author dropped out of college because she threatened to leave. The breakup was messy, with her leaving for the author's best friend and roommate, leading to the author being kicked out, living in their car, and facing isolation. They later moved back with their mom, finished college, married, and had a kid. No contact since the breakup, and now Rose calls, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author tells her to contact police or a shelter and blocks her, not wanting to involve their family. They didn't help, but are they in the wrong?\n\nHmm. The main ethical consideration here is the obligation to help someone in an emergency, even if they've been toxic. But the author's past experiences with Rose were extremely negative. She lied, led to the author's homelessness, and used people. The author is now in a good place with a family and wants to avoid any contact. \n\nOn one hand, if someone is in immediate danger, there's a societal expectation to call authorities or help them get assistance. But the author did direct her to the right resources and didn't enable her by not engaging further. The author's trauma from the past makes sense to want to cut off contact. Also, they're protecting their family from someone who's been harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that if the author has the means to help directly, they should. But given the circumstances, they were in a car, isolated, and Rose had a history of manipulating others. The author's actions were about safety and self-preservation.\n\nThe question is whether not personally helping constitutes being in the wrong. The author didn't ignore the emergency; they suggested appropriate help and then blocked her. They had a valid reason to avoid contact due to her toxic behavior. Their wife's reaction is also a factor; they don't want to expose their family to Rose's toxicity again.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They took steps to ensure Rose sought the right help and made a conscious decision to protect their own life and family from her. The past abuse and manipulation justify their refusal to get involved. Helping an abusive situation is important, but the author did that by directing her to professional resources instead of personally engaging, which could have led to more manipulation. So, the ethical choice here is not to enable her past behavior while still addressing the emergency through proper channels.\n"
