      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for taking a family member's child to get vaccinated when the parents are anti-vaxxers. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they would be at fault (WIBTA) for getting a family member's child vaccinated without the parents' consent. The parents are anti-vax, which means they likely oppose vaccinations. The user is using a throwaway account, probably to keep their identity private, which suggests they might feel this is a sensitive issue.\n\nNow, the core issue here is about parental rights versus the child's well-being. Parents have the legal right to make medical decisions for their children, including refusing vaccinations. However, there's also a societal and ethical consideration about protecting children from preventable diseases. If the parents are anti-vax, they might be putting the child and others at risk, especially if the child goes to school or public places where vaccinated people have herd immunity.\n\nBut legally, unless there's a court order or a specific law allowing others to override parental decisions for the child's benefit, the parents' choice might be upheld. In many jurisdictions, medical decisions require consent. So taking the child without consent could be seen as a violation of the parents' rights, even if the intent is good.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the child's health is paramount. If the parents are making decisions that endanger the child's health, some might argue that others (like family members) have a duty to step in. However, this is a gray area. Without legal authorization, taking such action could lead to legal repercussions for the person taking the child, even with good intentions.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The person wants to protect the child from potential harm, but they're also interfering with the parents' autonomy. The answer might depend on the specific laws of the region. For example, in some places, if a child is in imminent danger, authorities can step in, but a family member doing so might not have that legal standing.\n\nAnother angle: the user's motivation is to protect the child. But the means (taking the child without consent) might be problematic. There's also the aspect of trust within the family. If the parents find out, it could lead to serious conflicts, estrangement, or legal action.\n\nIn summary, while the intention is good, acting without parental consent could be legally and ethically questionable. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they overstepped their role as a family member, even if their motive was to protect the child. However, some might argue the opposite if they believe the parents are neglecting the child's health. But given the legal standpoint, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
