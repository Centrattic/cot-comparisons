Hmm.\n\nFirst, the parents are anti-vaxxers, so they probably don't want their child vaccinated. The author is stepping in without consent. Taking someone else's child for medical treatment without their permission seems like a violation of parental rights. Even if the author's intentions are good, like protecting the child's health, the parents have the legal right to make medical decisions for their child unless there's a court order or something.\n\nBut maybe there's more context. Like, if the child is in immediate danger, maybe it's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any emergency. Just anti-vax parents. So without legal authority, taking the child away to get vaccinated could be considered interfering with the parents' custody. So yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
