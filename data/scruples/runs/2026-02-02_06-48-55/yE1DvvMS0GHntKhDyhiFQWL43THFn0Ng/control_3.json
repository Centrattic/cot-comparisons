We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is part of a close-knit group of friends, and John was a new addition. John is described as rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. He often made condescending comments about the author's engineering job, called him derogatory names, and there was a history of tension. \n\nThen, at a party, the author confronts John in front of his family and friends, publicly shaming him by pointing out his failed job application, his photography skills, and his living situation. This leads to a physical altercation where John's dad shoves the author, John tries to attack, and the author gets kicked out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. \n\nJohn's behavior was clearly toxic: he was rude, passive-aggressive, and targeted the author repeatedly. The author did try to apologize for the National Geographic rejection, but John responded with more insults. The author's public confrontation, while harsh, might be seen as a culmination of ongoing conflict. However, the method\u2014public shaming in front of family and friends\u2014could be seen as escalating the situation even if John was an asshole.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, when someone is being bullied or harassed, there's a point where standing up for oneself is justified. However, public humiliation, even if deserved, can be seen as inappropriate. The author's words were harsh, but they were a response to months of provocation. The problem is whether the author had the right to confront John in that manner, especially in a private setting like a birthday party where such a confrontation might have been unwise.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to express frustration, but doing so in a public, aggressive way likely crossed a line. Public shaming can be harmful and contribute to the toxicity. Also, the physical altercation suggests that the confrontation was explosive, and the author's actions may have contributed to that.\n\nHowever, John's own behavior was inexcusable. The author's response, while uncouth, might be seen as a reaction to being targeted for an extended period. The key issue here is the public nature of the confrontation and the harshness of the remarks, which could be seen as inconsiderate and unnecessarily damaging, even if John was an asshole.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers if the person's actions, while perhaps understandable, were still inconsiderate or went too far. The author's public shaming led to immediate negative consequences, and even though John was a jerk, the way the author handled it might be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, the author might be considered at least partially in the wrong for escalating the situation in such a public manner.\n"
