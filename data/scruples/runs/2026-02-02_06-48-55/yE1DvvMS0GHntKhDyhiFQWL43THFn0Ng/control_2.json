We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that John is a new addition to their friend group, and the author has had issues with him for a while. John was rude, pretentious, and started a lot of arguments, especially with the author. He would insult the author's career and creativity. Then, after some incidents at a party, the author confronts John in front of his family and friends, calling out his bad photography, his job as a barista, mooching off his parents, and predicting he won't amount to anything. Then a fight almost breaks out, and the author is kicked out of the group.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The author had a lot of prior grievances with John, but public humiliation in front of family and friends might be crossing a line. Even if John was an asshole, responding with such harsh criticism in a public setting could be seen as the author's mistake. The author might have felt provoked over time, but attacking someone's character and future in front of others is pretty harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, John had been consistently rude and provocative, making personal attacks. The author might feel that they were defending themselves after repeated slights. But even so, the way the author chose to respond\u2014calling John out in a hurtful manner during a party\u2014could have been a misstep. The question is whether the author's response was an appropriate defense of their own dignity or an overreaction that escalated the conflict.\n\nAlso, the context of the situation matters. They were at a party, and the author used a mic to make their comments, which is a public setting. This could be seen as a deliberate choice to embarrass John, which is different from a private confrontation. The author's friends and the group's reaction (kicking him out) suggests that maybe they saw the author's actions as the problem.\n\nBut then again, John had a history of starting conflicts and being obnoxious. The author might feel that they were retaliating against someone who consistently disrespected them. However, the line between standing up for oneself and being aggressive in a public manner is thin. The author's statement about John not amounting to anything is a strong judgment call, which might be seen as crossing the line, regardless of prior behavior.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is an asshole, publicly shaming them can be socially frowned upon, leading to the author being seen as at fault. The friends' reaction and the aftermath (blocking, silence) might indicate that the group felt the author overstepped. So, while John's behavior was problematic, the author's response might be considered inappropriate, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though John was an asshole, the author chose a public and harsh way to respond, which escalated the situation and caused a significant fallout. The friends' reaction supports that they might see the author's actions as the problem, despite John's prior behavior.\n"
