We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a group of friends, John, who's been acting pretentious and rude. The author, M0shka, had a falling out with John, leading to a confrontation at a party where M0shka publicly insulted John's art and future prospects. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. John was already seen as obnoxious and pretentious by the author. He made condescending comments about the author's career and called them a \"drone.\" The author tried to apologize after John's job rejection, but John responded with more insults. Then, in a public setting, the author insulted John's work and personal situation, leading to a physical altercation and social fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. From a social standpoint, even if someone is an asshole, publicly humiliating them in front of friends and family can be seen as crossing a line. The author's insults were personal and derogatory, which could be considered rude and disrespectful regardless of John's behavior. However, the context of prior provocation might influence the perception. \n\nThe author had been subjected to ongoing taunts and insults from John, which built up over time. This could be seen as a culmination of tension. But even so, the public humiliation, especially in a situation where John was already vulnerable (post-rejection, at his birthday party), might not justify the author's response. The key here is whether the response was proportionate and appropriate. \n\nIn many social norms, responding to insults with further insults in a public setting often leads to more harm than good. It can escalate conflicts and damage relationships. The author's actions led to being kicked out and losing friends, which suggests that the group may have seen the author's actions as the final straw. \n\nHowever, if John's behavior was consistently toxic and the author felt wronged, there's an argument that the author had been provoked. But public shaming is generally frowned upon, even if motivated by self-defense or retaliation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's response was likely inappropriate, even if John was an asshole. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose a confrontational and humiliating approach in a public setting, which is typically seen as unwise and rude, regardless of prior tensions.\n"
