We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly insulting John at his birthday party. The situation is pretty intense. Let's start by looking at the details provided.\n\nFirst, John is described as rude, pretentious, and always trying to come off as superior. He called the author a \"drone\" and made fun of his career, which the author found annoying. John also made a big deal about the author's Reddit posts and criticized them. The author mentions that John is a photographer who works as a barista and had gotten rejected from a dream job, leading him to make a controversial Instagram post about discrimination.\n\nNow, the key event was at the birthday party. The author, after John made a derogatory comment in front of others, publicly criticized John's art, his job, his living situation, and predicted he wouldn't amount to anything. This led to a physical confrontation, John blocking the author, and the group distancing themselves.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Public shaming is generally not advisable. Even if John was an asshole, calling him out in front of his family and friends, especially during a personal event like a birthday, could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have escalated the conflict instead of addressing it privately. Also, the author's remarks were harsh and personal, attacking John's character and future, which can be considered bullying or harassment.\n\nOn the flip side, John's behavior over time was clearly toxic. He was condescending, insulting, and provocative. He didn't take criticism well and lashed out. The author might have felt provoked repeatedly, leading to a loss of temper. However, even with provocation, the appropriate response is usually to address the issue respectfully, not to retaliate publicly with harsh words.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's comment about John's race in the Instagram post isn't mentioned, but John claimed discrimination. The author apologized for John's job rejection, which shows some attempt at being considerate, but the response was too late and in the wrong context.\n\nThe author's response was in front of John's family and friends, which can be seen as a violation of social norms and possibly contributing to the breakdown of the friendship group. Even if John was an asshole, the public humiliation might be why others distanced themselves, as it's an uncomfortable situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while John's behavior was inconsiderate and insulting, the author's public shaming and personal attacks could be justified as self-defense in terms of standing up for themselves, but it's still a toxic way to handle conflict. The key point here is that public humiliation is rarely the solution, even if the person being humiliated is difficult.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while understandable given John's behavior, were likely inappropriate. The correct approach might have been to address the issue privately or seek mediation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A), but the context complicates it. However, in most social frameworks, the public confrontation is the main issue here.\n"
