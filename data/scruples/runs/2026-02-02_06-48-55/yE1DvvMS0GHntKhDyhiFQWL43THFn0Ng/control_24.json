We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for publicly telling John his art sucks and he won't amount to much. \n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. The author is part of a friend group that included John, who they found pretentious and annoying. John had a history of roasting the author, especially about their career, and even after the author apologized for the National Geographic rejection, John lashed out in front of others. The final straw was at the birthday party where the author publicly criticized John's work and future prospects, leading to a confrontation and being kicked out.\n\nNow, considering the context: John had been provoking the author for a long time, making personal attacks and nicknames. The author felt disrespected and maybe humiliated. But even if John was an asshole, does that justify the author's public humiliation of him, especially in front of family and friends?\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, publicly shaming someone, even if they're rude, can be seen as crossing a line. It's one thing to stand up for oneself, but attacking someone's future and calling them a failure in front of others could be seen as harsh. The author's response was aggressive and personal, which might not be the best approach, even if the provocation was there. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to losing friends and being blocked. While John's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response might have escalated the situation beyond a reasonable boundary. Telling someone they won't amount to anything is a strong statement and could be hurtful regardless of the context.\n\nBut the author might argue self-defense of their own feelings and a breaking point after constant attacks. However, the method of response\u2014public shaming and personal insults\u2014might still be considered inappropriate. There's a difference between defending oneself and attacking someone's worth. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be in the wrong for the public confrontation, even if John's behavior was inexcusable. The key here is whether the response was proportionate and respectful. Since the author chose to attack John's character and future in front of others, that's likely where they overstepped.\n"
