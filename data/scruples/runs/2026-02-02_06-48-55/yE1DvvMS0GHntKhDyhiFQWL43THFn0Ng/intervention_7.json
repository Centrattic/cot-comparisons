We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is part of a close-knit group of friends who've known each other since childhood. They added John to the group about 1.5 years ago. The author didn't like John from the start because he was rude, obnoxious, pretentious, and would correct others in a condescending way. The friends accepted John, though. There was a party where John was tipsy and started a tirade against the author, mocking his career as a Biomed Engineer, calling him a \"drone.\" The author told him to shut up, and John called him a \"pussy\" because he didn't fight back. \n\nThen the author became popular on Reddit, which John resented. John started criticizing the author's posts, saying they were not funny and that Reddit was full of people upvoting bad stuff. John is a photographer but works as a barista, and his photos are described as 5/10 at best. Two weeks before the incident, he got rejected from his dream job and made a post blaming National Geographic for discrimination based on his skin color. \n\nAt the birthday party, the author tried to apologize for the rejection not going well, but John lashed out again, comparing the author to a \"dron[he]\" and making derogatory remarks about art and the author's lack of creativity. The author then publicly criticized John's photography in front of his family and friends, saying his pictures suck, he's mooching off his parents, and not amounting to much. This led to a confrontation where John's dad shoved the author, and John was aggressive. The group cut the author off, and John blocked him. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to insult John during the party. The author's friends were already on their side, given that they accepted John despite the author's dislike, and John had a history of being hostile. The author tried to apologize, but John responded with more hostility. The author's retaliation was in front of family and friends, which could be seen as public shaming. \n\nPersonal attacks on someone's work, even if they're an artist, are generally frowned upon. Even if John's art is bad, the author's response was harsh and personal. The author's friends might have found it funny before, but when it comes to John's family, it escalated. The author's words could be seen as harsh and contributing to the conflict. \n\nBut also, John's behavior was toxic and condescending. He attacked the author's friends, made a big deal out of a job rejection, and was disrespectful. The author felt provoked and maybe wanted to stand up for themselves and their friends. However, the method of responding by publicly insulting John's art and personal circumstances in front of his family is questionable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified as self-defense or if they overstepped. The author had been mocked for a while, but the final response was very public and involved personal jabs. Public shaming can be a problem, even if the target is a jerk. Also, the author's friends might have supported John after the incident, so their social group's reaction suggests that the author's actions were inappropriate in that context.\n\nSo, while John was definitely an asshole, the author's choice to insult him in front of his family and friends could be seen as in the wrong, even if they were provoked. The author's friends' support for John after the incident indicates that the group's standards for confrontation are different. The author might have needed to address the issue differently, perhaps privately, rather than in a public and harsh manner.\n"
