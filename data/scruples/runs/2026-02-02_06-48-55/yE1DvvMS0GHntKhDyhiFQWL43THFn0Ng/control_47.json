We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The main points are:\n\n- The author is part of a close-knit group of friends. John joined about 1.5 years ago. The author dislikes John for being rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. John has made several annoying comments, especially targeting the author's profession as a Biomed Engineer. He nicknamed the author \"drone\" and continued to mock him. The author tried to stand up for himself but ended up being called a \"pussy.\" \n\n- John's own work as a photographer, despite his claims, is considered low quality by the author, and he recently got rejected from a job (National Geographic), which he blamed on discrimination. \n\n- At a birthday party, the author apologized for the job rejection, but John responded angrily. The author then publicly criticized John's work and life choices in front of his family and friends, leading to a physical confrontation and being kicked out. Now, the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the author's response was justified or not. \n\nFirst, let's consider John's behavior. He has been bullying the author for a long time, using public humiliation, nicknames, and constant mocking. The author tried to apologize after John's job rejection, which might have been a good gesture, but John responded in an aggressive manner again. \n\nThen, during the party, the author took a mic to confront John. What the author said was harsh\u2014calling John's photos bad, pointing out his job as a barista, mooching off parents, and predicting he won't amount to anything. This was done in front of family and friends. \n\nNow, in terms of social conduct, even if John was being an jerk, publicly humiliating him in a similar or more aggressive way might not be the right approach. While John's behavior was toxic, the author's response might have escalated the situation beyond what's acceptable. \n\nThe author's actions led to a physical altercation (John's dad shoved them), and as a result, the author was ostracized. The question is whether the author's harsh words were a proportionate response. \n\nIn many cases, even if someone is in the wrong, responding with public humiliation or harsh criticism, especially in a group setting, can be seen as crossing a line. The author had the option to avoid the confrontation or address it privately but chose a public and aggressive method. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about John not amounting to anything could be seen as particularly hurtful, especially in a public setting and in front of his family. That might be the tipping point that caused the fallout. \n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was clearly toxic and unkind, so the author's frustration is understandable. However, the method of response might not be the right way to handle it. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and escalating to public humiliation that causes a rift in the group. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might share some responsibility for the escalation. While John was in the wrong for his bullying, the author's public and harsh retort probably contributed to the negative outcome. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
