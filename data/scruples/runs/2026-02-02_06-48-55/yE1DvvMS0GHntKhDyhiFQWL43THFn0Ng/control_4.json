We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author publicly insulting a friend, John, in front of his family and friends after a series of conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a long-standing dislike for John, who they found pretentious and rude. John would constantly mock the author's career and their creative work. The final straw was at a birthday party where John made a derogatory comment in front of others, leading the author to respond with harsh insults about John's art, job, and future, which caused a physical altercation and the author being kicked out of the group.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. While John's behavior was clearly obnoxious and unkind, the author's response was to publicly humiliate him in front of friends and family. Even if John was a jerk, the author's approach of insulting him in such a personal and public manner might cross a line. Public shaming, even in retaliation, can be seen as toxic, regardless of the provocation. \n\nHowever, the context matters. The author had been a victim of ongoing ridicule and personal attacks from John. The situation had escalated over time, and the author felt cornered. But does that justify the response? Arguably, while the author might have been wronged, their method of confrontation was extreme. They could have chosen a different approach, like addressing the issue privately or setting boundaries without public humiliation. \n\nAlso, the fact that John was in a sensitive state (recent rejection, in front of family) might have made the author's public shaming even more harmful. It's important to consider that even if someone is an asshole, attacking them in front of others can damage relationships and contribute to a hostile environment. The author's actions likely caused lasting harm to the group dynamics and their friendships.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was defending themselves against constant bullying and that John's behavior was inexcusable. But the key here is the method of response. The author's public insult was not just a one-time reaction but a culmination of tensions, which might not be seen as justified in a social context where respect and civility are expected.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions were acceptable, regardless of the other person's faults. The author's public shaming and personal attacks, even in retaliation, are likely to be seen as the wrong move, making them the asshole in the situation. So the answer would be A.\n"
