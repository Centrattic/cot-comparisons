We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is part of a close-knit group of friends that included John, who they found annoying and pretentious. John's behavior included being rude, correcting others in a condescending way, and making the author feel targeted with nicknames and mockery. The author mentions that John's behavior escalated over time, including a rant at a party and subsequent comments about the author's career. Then, at a birthday party, after an apology from the author, John made a derogatory comment, leading the author to confront him publicly by criticizing his photography and life choices. This resulted in a confrontation and the author being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was justified. John had been acting disrespectfully towards the author for months, using insults and nicknames. The author tried to address it by telling John to shut up but was met with further aggression. The author's public criticism happened after John made a personal attack in front of others, including a girl who left upset. The author's statement about John's art and life could be seen as defending themselves after repeated slights.\n\nHowever, publicly humiliating someone at a party, even if provoked, is a sensitive issue. While John's behavior was inconsiderate, the author chose to respond with a harsh public critique that included personal details. This might be seen as crossing a line, even if the provocation was there. The question is whether the author's response was a reasonable retaliation or if it was an overreaction. The key factors here are the ongoing nature of the conflict, the public setting, and the specific words used.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their own dignity after sustained harassment. On the other, the public humiliation could have been an excessive response. The fact that John was already hostile might mitigate some of the blame on the author, but the author's statement about John's future (\"you won't amount to anything\") could be seen as particularly harsh. Friends might expect some conflict but not public degradation. The group's reaction of excluding the author suggests that even if John was an asshole, the author's response was not socially acceptable in their circle.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while verbal aggression can be a defense mechanism, it's often seen as unkind and damaging to relationships. The author's actions may have been a justified reaction to being bullied, but the method of response could be considered in the wrong because it escalated the situation and caused a rift in the group. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) for the public humiliation aspect, despite the provocation. But there's a nuance here because the author was reacting to ongoing abuse.\n"
