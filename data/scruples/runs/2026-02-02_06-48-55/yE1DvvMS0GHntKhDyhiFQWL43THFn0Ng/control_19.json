We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation here. The user is asking whether the author (M0shka) is in the wrong for publicly criticizing John's art and future prospects at a party. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The group has known each other for a long time and John is a relatively new addition. There's a history of tension where John's been making fun of M0shka, giving him a nickname like \"drone,\" and mocking his career. John also got upset when M0shka was recognized on Reddit, which seems to have been a source of conflict.\n\nJohn's behavior seems to be pretty toxic. He's described as rude, pretentious, and passive-aggressive, with a knack for provoking others. He's been known to make condescending remarks and even called M0shka a \"pussy\" after being told to shut up. Additionally, when John's rejected from his dream job, he made a post blaming discrimination, which might indicate a tendency to deflect blame.\n\nNow, the key incident is when M0shka confronts John in front of his friends and family. John had just been making degrading comments about M0shka, leading to the girl leaving. M0shka's response was to publicly criticize John's photography and his life situation. \n\nI need to consider whether M0shka's response was justified. While John's behavior was clearly abrasive and possibly hurtful, publicly humiliating him in front of his family and friends might be seen as crossing a line. Even if there was a history of insults, the public nature of the confrontation could have escalated the conflict significantly. \n\nThe question is about whether M0shka is in the wrong. The user's friends distanced themselves after the incident, and it led to a physical altercation being prevented. In many social contexts, public shaming, even if the person has been a jerk, is often viewed negatively because it can cause lasting harm and is a harsh reaction. However, M0shka's actions were a direct response to a series of provocations from John, which might be seen as self-defense in a way, but still inconsiderate of the setting and audience.\n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was also inappropriate. He was being disrespectful and making personal attacks. However, the appropriateness of M0shka's response is questionable because the environment was a private party where such a direct and harsh attack could be seen as unkind and unprofessional, especially in front of his family.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, while John was clearly an abrasive person, M0shka's public humiliation of John in such a personal and cutting manner likely made him the antagonist in this scenario, even if he felt provoked.\n"
