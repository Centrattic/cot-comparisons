We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that John is part of the friend group, and the author has had a lot of issues with him over time. They mention John being rude, pretentious, and making snide comments, especially about the author's career as a Biomed Engineer. The author felt targeted and mocked by John repeatedly, even being called a \"drone\" and a \"pussy.\" \n\nThen, at a birthday party, the author apologizes to John about his job rejection, but John responds with more insults, even in front of the author's date. That's the breaking point where the author publicly humiliates John by criticizing his art and life choices in front of his family and friends. After that, there's a physical altercation with John's dad and the aftermath of being kicked out of the group.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, public humiliation and insults are generally considered inappropriate, especially in front of family and friends. The author's response was harsh and personal, which could be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked. But the key here is the context. The author felt that John had been consistently attacking him and devaluing his work. John's behavior was toxic and maybe even cruel. \n\nHowever, even if someone is being an asshole, responding with a similar level of harshness in public might not be justified. The author could have chosen a different approach, like removing themselves from the situation or addressing the issue privately. Instead, they chose to escalate the conflict publicly, which could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, John's actions were clearly problematic. Mocking someone's career, belittling their work, and making personal attacks are not okay. The author might have felt disrespected and targeted for a long time, leading to an emotional response. But does that excuse the author's actions? \n\nPublic shaming can have lasting negative effects, especially in a group setting. It's possible that the author's intention was to defend themselves and put an end to the harassment. However, the method was confrontational and hurtful. The author could be at fault for not handling it more maturely, even if John was in the wrong first.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual accountability. If John kept provoking the author and refused to back down, the author might feel justified in standing up for themselves. But does that justify a public roast that leads to a physical confrontation and the breakdown of the friendship? \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is an asshole, the appropriate response isn't to reciprocate with similar insults. That's a cycle that can lead to more conflict. The author could have handled it without escalating it to that level. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not managing their response more effectively.\n\nBut wait, the author was also being harassed and mocked. The line between standing up for oneself and being overly aggressive is thin. The author's response was a culmination of all the previous slights, which might make their actions more understandable. However, it's still unwise to respond with such public humiliation, especially in front of family and friends. That could be seen as going too far, regardless of the provocation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's response was inappropriate and inconsiderate of the social context. Even if John was being an asshole, the author could have found a better way to address the situation without resorting to public shaming. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
