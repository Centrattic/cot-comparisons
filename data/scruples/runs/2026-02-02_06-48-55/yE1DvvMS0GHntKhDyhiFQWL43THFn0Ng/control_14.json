We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person named John who's been a source of irritation to the author and their friends. John's behavior has been rude, pretentious, and he's been making constant derogatory remarks towards the author. The author, after a series of escalating incidents, confronts John publicly at a party by criticizing his art and future prospects, leading to a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions were justified. The author mentions that John was rude, obnoxious, and pretentious. He also made personal attacks, including a long tirade about the author's career and creativity. John's behavior towards the author was persistent and offensive. However, the author's response was to publicly call out John in front of his family and friends, making harsh criticisms about his work and life choices. \n\nPublicly shaming someone, even if they've been offensive, can be problematic. While the author might have felt wronged, the manner of their response\u2014mocking someone in front of others\u2014could be seen as aggressive and unkind. The author's comment about John's art and lack of success, while perhaps true in John's eyes, was delivered in a disrespectful way. Even if John's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's choice to respond with similar harshness in a public setting might be seen as escalating the conflict rather than addressing it constructively.\n\nMoreover, the author claims that the group had been making jokes about the incidents, indicating a pattern of mockery. However, when the author took the mic to confront John, it led to a physical confrontation. The author's statement about John's future (\"You're not going to amount to anything\") is particularly harsh and personal. While John had been rude, this kind of public humiliation could have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt targeted by John's ongoing insults and might have felt that their own reputation was being attacked. The situation had been building up for months with repeated offenses. The author's apology to John after the job rejection might have been a genuine attempt to de-escalate, but John's response was combative. \n\nIn terms of social norms and conflict resolution, public shaming is often seen as inconsiderate regardless of the provocation. The author's response was a direct attack on John's character and work, which might have been excessive. Even if the author felt justified, the method of confrontation could be considered wrong. \n\nSo, while John's behavior was inexcusable, the author's public humiliation of him might be seen as an overreaction. The key point is whether the author's actions crossed the line into being unkind or unnecessarily harsh. The answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the response was a public insult that contributed to the conflict, even if there were prior provocations.\n"
