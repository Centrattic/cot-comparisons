We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they called someone's art bad and said he wouldn't amount to much in front of his friends and family. The writer's name is M0shka.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The group of friends has known each other for a long time and added John recently. John is described as rude, pretentious, and started arguments. He mocked the author's job as a Biomed Engineer. The author felt disrespected and was called names like 'drone' and 'pussy'. \n\nThen, John was rejected from his dream job and accused discrimination. At the birthday party, he insulted the author back, leading to the author losing it and publicly criticizing John's photography and life choices. The result was a physical confrontation, the author being kicked out, and ongoing silence from the group.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. John's behavior was clearly hostile and condescending. He made personal attacks and was disrespectful. The author had a history of being mocked, and John's comments were persistent and hurtful. However, the author's response was to publicly\u4fae\u8fb1 John in front of his family and friends, which is a significant escalation. Even if provoked, the method of response is important. \n\nThere's a difference between standing up for oneself and public shaming. The author's choice to use the mic at the birthday party to criticize John's work and personal life in front of others might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of John's behavior. Public humiliation can be harmful and may have contributed to the escalation into a physical confrontation. \n\nEven if John was an asshole, the author's public criticism could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a social setting with family present. The author's actions might have been a justified reaction in their eyes, but the method was aggressive and could be viewed as the author's fault for not handling it more privately. \n\nSo, while John's actions were problematic, the author's public response might be the point where they are in the wrong. They could have addressed the issue in a less confrontational way. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
