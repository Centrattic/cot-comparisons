We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that John, a new friend in the group, has been really annoying and pretentious. The author has had a lot of run-ins with him, like John correcting others in a snarky way and constantly belittling the author's career. The author felt disrespected and targeted, and over time, the tension escalated. Then, at a party, John made a comment in front of the author's girlfriend, which caused her to leave. The author then publicly insulted John's art, his job, his situation, and basically told him he wouldn't amount to anything. This led to a physical confrontation and the group breaking apart.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. From the author's perspective, John was being a jerk, making personal attacks, and the author might have felt cornered or disrespected. The author tried to apologize after the Nat Geo incident, but John responded with more insults. The author's response was in the heat of the moment, but it's pretty harsh. They publicly shamed John, mentioning his job, his living situation, and his lack of success. Even if John was an asshole, the author's response was pretty cutting, especially in front of family and friends. Public humiliation can be really damaging, and even if John provoked it, the author might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was clearly problematic. He was rude, condescending, and targeted the author repeatedly. The author tried to de-escalate by apologizing, but John kept the conflict going. However, the author's response of telling John his art sucks and that he won't amount to anything in front of others might be seen as a proportional retaliation, but maybe not. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to ongoing harassment. But even so, publicly humiliating someone, even if they are an asshole, can be considered in the wrong, especially because it led to a physical altercation and the breakdown of the friendship group.\n\nAlso, the author's friends might have been in on accepting John despite his behavior, so maybe they expected some level of conflict. But the author's direct attack on John's personal life and work might have been the final straw. The question is about whether the author was in the wrong. Even if John was an asshole, the author's public shaming could be seen as crossing a line. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while John's behavior was bad, the author's response was a public humiliation that probably wasn't justified, especially when it led to a violent reaction and the group splitting up. Even if they felt wronged, the way they handled it might have been too harsh."
