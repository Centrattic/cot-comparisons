We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly insulting John at the birthday party. The situation seems pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author joined a group of friends, and John was the new addition. The author didn't like John from the start because he was rude, pretentious, and they had made fun of him before. Then John started roasting the author's job as a Biomed Engineer, calling him a drone, and later mocked his Reddit posts. John works as a barista but calls himself a photographer, even though his work is bad. After being rejected from a job, he posted something about discrimination. At the party, the author apologized for the rejection, but John responded with a derogatory comment in front of others. The author then publicly insulted John's work and personal life, leading to a physical confrontation and being kicked out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider factors like intent, provocation, public humiliation, and the consequences. John's behavior was clearly problematic\u2014he was being mean, insults the author, and made a racist claim. However, the author's response was also harsh and public. Even if John was an asshole, the author's choice to attack him in front of family and friends might be crossing a line. Public humiliation can be a big deal, and even if the author felt provoked, responding with such a direct and personal attack might not be justified. Also, the author admitted that John is a 5/10 photographer, but telling him he's not going to amount to anything is a strong statement. Even if the author has a history of being mocked by John, that doesn't necessarily make the retaliation okay. The physical altercation was a result of the author's words, so that's a point against him. On the other hand, John's behavior was toxic and the author might have been defending their self-worth. But in a social situation like a party, especially with family present, the author's approach might have been too aggressive. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response or if they escalated the situation unnecessarily. Given that the author built up a history of being insulted and then finally snapped, but the method of response was public and personal, maybe they are at least partially at fault. The answer would lean towards AITA being the author because of the public shaming and personal attacks, even if John's behavior was terrible. The author could have handled it without attacking John's character so directly in front of others.\n"
