We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, let's call them M0shka, has been part of a close-knit group of friends for a long time. They added a new member, John, who they found rude and pretentious. John's behavior included interrupting others with condescending remarks and making snide comments about M0shka's career. Over time, John started mocking M0shka's Reddit posts and gave them a nickname they disliked. Tensions escalated when John made a derogatory comment during a birthday party, leading M0shka to publicly criticize John's art and future prospects in front of his family and friends, causing a physical altercation and social fallout.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether M0shka's response was justified. Let's break it down.\n\nJohn's behavior: He was rude, pretentious, and condescending. He made personal attacks and used derogatory nicknames. However, even if someone is an asshole, that doesn't necessarily justify retaliating with harsh public criticism, especially in front of their family and friends. \n\nM0shka's actions: Publicly shaming John by pointing out his failures (job rejection, living with parents, lack of degree) and predicting he'll amount to nothing. This was done in a sensitive setting\u2014a birthday party with family present. Even if M0shka felt wronged, the method of response was confrontational and harsh, leading to a fight and social isolation.\n\nKey considerations: \n1. **Proportionality**: Was the response proportionate to the provocation? John's insults were ongoing but perhaps not severe enough to warrant a public humiliation that included personal attacks on his career and personal life.\n2. **Public Shaming**: Calling someone out in front of their family and friends can be particularly damaging. It might escalate conflicts rather than resolve them.\n3. **Intent and Consequences**: M0shka's intent was to retaliate after feeling mocked, but the consequence was losing friends and causing a rift. Even if John was in the wrong, the way M0shka confronted him could be seen as crossing a line.\n4. **Accountability**: The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While John's behavior was problematic, the author's response might still be considered inappropriate, especially in a public and personal setting.\n\nPossible angles for the author being in the wrong (A): The public humiliation, even if justified in their eyes, was a harsh response. It's important to consider the impact on others and whether there were better ways to handle the situation. Also, making predictions about someone's future success (\"won't amount to anything\") can be seen as cruel and unfounded.\n\nPossible angles for the author not being in the wrong (B): John's behavior was clearly hurtful and condescending. M0shka might have felt targeted and disrespected, leading to an emotional response. In social groups where such dynamics exist, sometimes harsh responses are seen as justified if the person was an instigator.\n\nHowever, most people would argue that even if someone is an asshole, publicly shaming them in a personal setting, especially in front of family, is crossing a line. The author's actions led to a physical altercation and social consequences, which might indicate that their response was excessive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response, while perhaps understandable, was not appropriate given the context and consequences.\n"
