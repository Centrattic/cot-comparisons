We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The author, let's call him M0shka, has a group of friends who accepted John, a person they all didn't really like. John was described as rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. He often made condescending remarks, especially towards M0shka's career as a Biomed Engineer, calling him a \"drone\" and roasting him. Over time, John's behavior escalated, leading to a confrontation at a party.\n\nAt the birthday party, John insulted M0shka in front of others, which caused a girl M0shka was with to leave. In response, M0shka publicly criticized John's art, his job as a barista, his lack of a college degree, and his living situation with parents, predicting he wouldn't amount to anything. This led to a physical altercation being prevented, and M0shka was kicked out. Now, the group is silent, and John has blocked him.\n\nThe question is whether M0shka is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, consider the context: John had a history of being rude and condescending. He provoked M0shka over a long period, using derogatory nicknames and public ridicule. However, M0shka's response was to publicly insult John's work, life choices, and future prospects. While John's behavior was inexcusable, M0shka's response was also harsh and public. \n\nThe key points here are about proportionality and the appropriateness of the response. Even if someone is acting in a hurtful manner, responding with similar harshness in public could be seen as escalating the conflict. M0shka had the opportunity to address the issue privately, but instead chose to confront John in front of family and friends, which might be considered inconsiderate regardless of John's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the content of M0shka's outburst included personal attacks on John's career, financial situation, and future. Making predictions about someone not amounting to anything is not just a critique of their work but a judgment of their entire life, which can be particularly hurtful. \n\nHowever, John's behavior was undeniably toxic, and M0shka had been a victim of ongoing bullying. This complicates the situation, as the author was responding to repeated provocation. The line between defending oneself and lashing out is thin here. \n\nAnother angle is the impact of the actions. M0shka's public humiliation of John led to a physical confrontation being prevented and the dissolution of the friend group. This suggests that his response, while perhaps understandable, had severe consequences. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while defending oneself is acceptable, doing so in a derogatory and public manner often is seen as wrong, even if the other person is at fault. The question is whether the response was justified given the prior interactions. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a response to a hostile environment, but the manner and public nature of the confrontation may place some responsibility on him. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite John's behavior, the public and harsh retort could be seen as excessive and contributing to the breakdown of the situation.\n"
