We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is part of a close-knit group of friends where John was added recently. The author didn't like John from the start, describing him as rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. There are examples like John correcting someone about Einstein and using condescending terms like \"gridiron.\" The group accepted John despite this.\n\nThen there's the issue of John constantly roasting the author, calling him a \"drone\" and other derogatory terms, even provoking him to fight. The author tried to apologize after John was rejected from a job and was angry, leading to a confrontation. At the birthday party, after John made a derogatory comment in front of a girl who left, the author publicly criticized John's photography, his job, his living situation, and basically told him he wouldn't amount to anything. This led to a physical altercation and the author being kicked out. Now, the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the core of the question is whether the author's response was justified. On one hand, John was being a jerk, provoking the author, and making personal attacks. The author felt humiliated in front of others. On the other, the author publicly called John out in a very harsh way in front of his family and friends, which might have escalated the situation. While John's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response was also quite aggressive and public, possibly overstepping.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to consider if the response was proportional. John had been behaving badly, but the author's public humiliation of John, especially in front of his family, might have crossed a line. Even if John was an asshole, the author's approach may have been too harsh and contributed to the breakdown of the friendship and group dynamics. Also, the author was kicked out, and others didn't support them, which might indicate that the group felt the author's actions were too extreme, despite John's behavior.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was defending themselves from constant bullying and that John's behavior was inexcusable. But the method of response\u2014public shaming during a party in his home\u2014might not be the healthiest or most mature approach. So, while John is clearly part of the problem, the author's actions likely made things worse and are in the wrong to some extent. But I'm a bit torn because the context is that John was being really toxic. Still, the author's public humiliation was probably not the right move. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
