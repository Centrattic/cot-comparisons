We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call them M0shka, is part of a close-knit group of friends that recently included John. John has been described as rude, pretentious, and annoying. He's a photographer who works as a barista and got rejected from his dream job at National Geographic, which he blamed on discrimination. The author had a falling out with John where he was called a \"drone\" and a \"pussy,\" and the author finally snapped during a party by publicly criticizing John's art and his life circumstances in front of friends and family, leading to a confrontation and being kicked out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: publicly humiliating John in front of his family and friends by saying his art sucks, calling him a mooch, and predicting he'll amount to nothing. That's pretty harsh, even if John was an asshole. While John was definitely a problematic person, the author's response was a direct attack in a public setting, which can be seen as crossing a line. Even if there was a history of insults, the author's public humiliation could have been more damaging. \n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was inconsiderate and offensive. He targeted the author with insults, was pretentious, and made inappropriate comments. The author might have felt disrespected and that their efforts were mocked, especially regarding their career. The author's frustration might be understandable, but the way they expressed it\u2014publicly and in a confrontational manner\u2014might not be the right approach.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were an appropriate response. Even if John was an asshole, publicly shaming him in front of his family and friends could be seen as the author's mistake. The author might have felt justified, but the method of response could have led to further conflict. The author's friends didn't support the action, leading to their isolation. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's response was a direct and harsh retort to John's provocations, but it's likely that the author is at least partially in the wrong for escalating the situation publicly. Even if John's behavior was bad, the author's approach might have been too aggressive and unproductive. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
