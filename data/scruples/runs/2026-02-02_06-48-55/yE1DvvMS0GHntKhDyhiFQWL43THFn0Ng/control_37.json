We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong by telling John his art sucks and that he won't amount to much in front of friends and family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author and John are in a close-knit group of friends. John's behavior was pretty obnoxious\u2014he made pretentious comments, mocked others, gave nicknames, and seemed to provoke the author. The author mentions that John was rude and would interrupt conversations with condescending remarks. Over time, John's behavior escalated, including making the author feel belittled and even causing a girl to leave the party after an argument.\n\nThe key point is the confrontation at the birthday party. The author, after being provoked and having their comments dismissed by John, publicly criticized John's work and personal situation. The author's response was harsh, but considering the context of ongoing harassment and the public nature of the event, there's a case to be made here about the appropriateness of the response.\n\nHowever, even if John's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response was direct and public. Publicly shaming someone, even if they're an asshole, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's words were hurtful and personal, attacking John's career, living situation, and future potential. Even if John deserved it, delivering such a critique in front of friends and family could be seen as the author's fault for not handling it privately.\n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was inexcusable. He was consistently rude, and the author was provoked. The author's outburst might be a result of built-up frustration. But does that justify the public shaming? The question is whether the author overstepped regardless of the provocation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is an asshole, responding with public humiliation might not be the right approach. The author's actions likely caused a rift in the group, and they might be at fault for not addressing the issue in a more constructive way. So, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong because they chose a public and harsh response, even if John was an asshole. But maybe the context of ongoing provocation complicates it. However, the general consensus in such AITA scenarios often holds that public shaming is unwise, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
