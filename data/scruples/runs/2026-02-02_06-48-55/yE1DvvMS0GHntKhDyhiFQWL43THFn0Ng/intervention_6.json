We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's part of a group of friends who've known each other a long time, and John, the new guy, is causing a lot of issues. From the start, the author didn't like John because he was rude and pretentious. Then John started criticizing the author's career as a Biomed Engineer, giving him a nickname like 'drone' and 'pussy' after some conflicts. John also made comments about the author's Reddit posts and his photography.\n\nThe key event was the birthday party where the author publicly called out John's art, mentioned his job as a barista, mooching off parents, and predicted he wouldn't amount to anything. That led to a confrontation where John's dad shoved him, John attacked, and the author got kicked out. Now, the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's actions were justified. Even if John was an asshole and had been causing problems, publicly shaming him in front of his friends and family might cross a line. The author's response was pretty harsh and personal, attacking John's career, life choices, and future. Public humiliation can be a big deal, especially in a social setting where the person's reputation among peers is at stake.\n\nEven if John had been rude and provocative, responding with such direct and demeaning comments might not be the right approach. The author had already expressed disapproval before, but taking it to that level during a party could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. The fact that the author was cut off by others and the situation ended with violence suggests that the public criticism was a significant factor.\n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was definitely toxic and inconsiderate. He was condescending, used derogatory nicknames, and made personal attacks. The author might have felt wronged and wanted to stand up for himself. However, the method of response\u2014public shaming in a confrontational manner\u2014might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's intent was to defend himself and assert his own worth, but the way it was done likely made things worse.\n\nIn terms of social norms and conflict resolution, it's generally advised to address issues privately rather than in a public, humiliating way. The author might have thought he was justified, but the outcome shows that it led to a breakdown in the group dynamic and personal relationships. So, while John was definitely in the wrong for his behavior and the way he treated the author, the author's response could also be seen as inappropriate, even if motivated by frustration. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, despite the provocation.\n"
