We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (M0shka) is in the wrong after publicly criticizing John's art and making personal attacks during a birthday party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: John joined the friend group, was already seen as pretentious and rude. He constantly belittled M0shka's career, called him a \"drone\" and a \"pussy\" after a confrontation. John's own behavior was problematic, including a tirade about M0shka's job and making a post about being discriminated against after a job rejection. \n\nAt the party, M0skha's outburst was in response to John's public insult in front of his family and friends, which caused a girl to leave. M0skha then publicly called out John's art, criticized his job status, and said he wouldn't amount to much. This led to a physical confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is about whether M0shka is in the wrong. Even though John was an asshole and had been antagonizing him, publicly shaming someone in front of their family and friends, especially with personal attacks about their career and future, is pretty harsh. While John's behavior was inconsiderate and harmful, M0shka's response might be seen as crossing a line into public humiliation, which can damage relationships and escalate conflicts. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is a jerk, responding with similar harshness in a public setting can make you equally at fault. The fact that it led to a physical altercation and social fallout suggests that M0shka's actions had serious consequences. However, there's also the context of John's prior behavior. But the question is about whether M0shka is in the wrong, not just whether John was a bad person. \n\nSo, while John's behavior was poor, M0shka's choice to publicly humiliate him in a confrontational manner, especially in front of family and friends, might be considered wrong. It's possible that a more private response or not engaging in the argument at all would have been better. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if provoked, the public and harsh response was inappropriate.\n"
