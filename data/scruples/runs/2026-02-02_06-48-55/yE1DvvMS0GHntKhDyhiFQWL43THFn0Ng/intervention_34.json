We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was part of a group where a new person, John, was being really annoying and rude. John would constantly mock the author's career and make snide comments. The author tried to tell him to stop, but John kept pushing back. Then, at a party, John made a snarky comment in front of others, which led the author to lash out publicly, saying John's art was bad and he wouldn't amount to anything. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. John's behavior was clearly problematic\u2014he was being condescending, interrupting others, and mocking the author's profession. The author felt disrespected and targeted, especially when John kept using the nickname \"drone\" and making belittling remarks. The author tried to set boundaries by telling John to stop, but John escalated the situation, even challenging the author to a fight. That's a red flag for aggressive behavior.\n\nThen there's the incident at the party. John's response to the author's apology was hostile and public, which probably provoked the author. The author's retort was harsh and public, attacking John's work and personal life. Even if John was an asshole, the author's response was a direct attack in front of his family and friends, which could be seen as crossing a line. Public humiliation can be hurtful, even if the person being humiliated is also at fault.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was justified given the prior provocation. While John's behavior was inexcusable, the author's choice to respond with public insults and predictions about John's future could be seen as contributing to the escalation. The author might have felt wronged, but the method of responding\u2014especially in front of family and friends\u2014might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's actions, while understandable in the heat of the moment, were not the most constructive way to handle the situation.\n\nAlso, the author's friends didn't back them up, leading to being kicked out, which suggests maybe the group felt the author overstepped. Even if John was an asshole, the author's actions led to a conflict that could have been avoided with a different approach, like walking away or addressing it privately.\n\nSo, while John was definitely in the wrong for his behavior, the author's public shaming and harsh words might also be considered inappropriate, even in self-defense. The author's final outburst seems to have been the trigger that caused the fallout. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the escalation.\n"
