We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. So, the user, who goes by M0shka, is part of a close-knit group of friends. They had a new member, John, who they didn't really like from the start. John was rude and pretentious, and he often made snide comments about M0shka's career as a Biomed Engineer. John would mock him, calling him a \"drone\" and other names, even after M0shka told him to stop. \n\nThen, John got rejected from his dream job at National Geographic and made a post about discrimination. At a party, M0shka tried to apologize, but John lashed out, leading to M0shka losing his temper and publicly insulting John in front of his family and friends. The user is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overreact, or was their response justified given the prior treatment they received? Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, John's behavior was definitely toxic. He was constantly belittling the author and others, showing a pattern of arrogance and insensitivity. The author had been on the receiving end of a lot of mockery and name-calling. However, the author's response was to publicly humiliate John in front of his family and friends, which escalated the situation to a physical confrontation. Even though John was an asshole, publicly shaming someone in a personal and harsh way can be seen as crossing a line.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While John's behavior was inexcusable, the author's response might be seen as a tit-for-tat, but public humiliation can have serious consequences. The author's comments were not just a defense but an attack on John's character, which could be seen as unkind and contributing to the breakdown of the friendship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was part of a group that accepted John, even though they didn't like him, might imply some responsibility in how they handled the conflict. The author's public insult likely caused lasting damage to relationships in the group. \n\nSo, even though John was a jerk, the author's reaction might not make them the good guy. Publicly tearing someone apart in a personal attack, even if they've been an asshole, is generally considered wrong. The author could have handled it differently, perhaps by setting boundaries without attacking in return. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
