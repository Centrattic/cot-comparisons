I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job. The situation is that the author and their date went to a burger place, the waitress was good, even after a minor spill. The author then told the manager how great the waitress was. The date was upset about this and called the author an asshole.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which is a positive action. But the date didn't like it. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress in front of management, which might have come across as unnecessary or even condescending. Or perhaps she found it awkward or thought it was over the top. \n\nThe author didn't do anything harmful, per se. Praise is usually a good thing. But in a dating context, sometimes actions can have different meanings depending on the person's perspective. The date might have felt that the author was trying to show off or wasn't being sincere. Alternatively, maybe she felt that the situation wasn't the right time or place for such a compliment, especially in front of others.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the action itself (complimenting the waitress) isn't inherently wrong. It's a kind thing to do. However, in a dating scenario, the girl's reaction suggests that she might have had different expectations. The author didn't consider her feelings in that moment, which could have been a misstep. But was it the author's fault? It's possible the date was already having other issues, and this was the last straw. The author's intention was positive, but the outcome was negative. \n\nOn one hand, complimenting someone's work is good. On the other, not considering the date's perspective might be a mistake. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was a positive one, maybe the answer is \"No,\" the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the context of the date being important and the girl feeling unimpressed by the gesture, maybe there's something there. But I think the key here is that complimenting a server is a good deed, and the author didn't do anything unethical or harmful. The girl's reaction is more about her personal feelings rather than the author being wrong. So probably answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
