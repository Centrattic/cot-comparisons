I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author wanted to compliment their waitress by telling the manager she did a great job. The date didn't like that and called them an asshole. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their date were at a burger place, and the waitress provided excellent service. Even when she spilled water, she handled it well. The author wanted to acknowledge her good work by speaking to the manager. Usually, people do that to give positive feedback, which is a good thing. But the date was upset about it.\n\nWhy would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress the waitress or show off. But the author's intention was to praise the waitress, not to impress anyone else. The author even said they just wanted good conversation and a tasty meal. The waitress was happy with the compliment, so it seems well-intentioned.\n\nHowever, the date might have different expectations. Maybe she thought the author should have just tipped well and didn't need to go the extra step of talking to the manager. Or perhaps she felt it was unnecessary and made the situation awkward. But is that a valid reason for the author to be in the wrong?\n\nThe key here is whether the author did something that was inappropriate. Complimenting someone's work is generally encouraged. Restaurants often appreciate positive feedback as it helps their employees. The author didn't do anything wrong in that regard. The date's reaction seems to be based on personal feelings or misunderstandings. \n\nThe author apologized, which shows they tried to make amends. The date's lack of response is her choice, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to give the compliment. So, the author's action was a positive one, and the date's reaction might be her issue, not his fault. Therefore, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
