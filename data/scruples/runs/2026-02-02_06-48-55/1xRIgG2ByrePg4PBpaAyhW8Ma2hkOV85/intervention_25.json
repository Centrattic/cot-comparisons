I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the guy who wrote this is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nHe went on a date with a girl he really liked, they were having a good time. The waitress was great, even when she had a minor spill, handled it well. At the end, he asked to talk to the manager and told them the waitress did an excellent job. The date didn't like it, thought it was full of himself and it didn't impress her. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, his intention was to praise the waitress, which is a good thing. But the problem came from his date's perspective. Maybe she felt like he was trying to show off or be a hero? Or perhaps she thought he was overstepping by bringing the manager in for a positive comment. But is the author actually in the wrong?\n\nFrom the waitress's side, getting a compliment from a customer is good for her. The manager was thanked, the waitress was happy. The author's action seems positive. But why did the date take it as an asshole move?\n\nMaybe the date interpreted it as him trying to impress her by being overly helpful or showing off. Or maybe she didn't like that he was paying extra attention to the waitress, even if it was just a compliment. Jealousy? Or maybe she thought it was unnecessary to go through the manager for a compliment. \n\nBut the author's action was a genuine compliment. There's no indication he did it to show off. He did it because the service was good. The date's reaction is her own insecurity or misinterpretation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to acknowledge good service. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should have given the compliment directly to the waitress instead of involving the manager, but the waitress did receive the compliment through the manager. The manager's role is to handle feedback, so that's standard. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's action was appropriate and positive. The date's negative reaction is her own issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
