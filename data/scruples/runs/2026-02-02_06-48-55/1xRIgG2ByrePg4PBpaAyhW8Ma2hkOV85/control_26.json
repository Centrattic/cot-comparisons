I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which upset his date.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his date went to a burger place. The waitress provided good service, even after spilling a glass of water. The author wanted to commend her, so he spoke to the manager. The date was upset, felt it was self-serving, and ended the night without a kiss or response.\n\nSo, why did the date get mad? Maybe she felt the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress instead of focusing on their own interaction. Or perhaps she disliked the idea of him interacting with another woman, even in a professional context. Could be a jealousy issue, or maybe she thought it was unnecessary to tell the manager, making a big deal out of a simple compliment. Alternatively, she might have thought the waitress didn't need the praise, but that's less likely since the author described her service as excellent.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, complimenting someone's job performance is usually a good thing. He didn't do anything harmful or inappropriate. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated the feedback. The issue seems to be the date's reaction, not the author's action. Unless the author intended to undermine their date by showing off, which isn't indicated here. The author's actions were genuine praise, and the date's response was unexpected. The author tried to apologize, showing he wasn't trying to be a jerk. So, the problem lies more with the date's reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
