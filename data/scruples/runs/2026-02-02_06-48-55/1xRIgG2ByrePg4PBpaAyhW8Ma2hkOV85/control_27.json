I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, leading to a conflict with his date.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his date went to a burger place. The waitress provided great service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so he spoke to the manager. His date was upset, called him an asshole, and seems to have ended the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. So, the key points here. The author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. But his date took it negatively. Why would she react that way?\n\nPossible reasons: Maybe she felt he was trying to show off or be overly nice in front of her. Or perhaps she thought he was overstepping by involving the manager. Or maybe she's indifferent to such gestures and felt it was unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe the situation made her uncomfortable for some reason.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was trying to do something kind. The waitress appreciated the compliment, and the manager was grateful. The action itself seems positive. However, the date's reaction suggests she had a different expectation. Maybe she didn't like that he focused on the waitress, or she felt it was a way to avoid paying attention to her.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job. Praise is usually appreciated. But in the context of a date, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. Did he do it for the right reasons? If he did it genuinely, then maybe not. But if he was trying to impress her by showing off, then maybe she felt that.\n\nBut according to the story, he was genuinely happy with the service. The date didn't like the gesture, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. People have different expectations. It's a misunderstanding rather than a clear wrong. The author apologized, which shows he's trying to make amends. The date's reaction is more about her personal feelings than the action itself.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The action was positive, and the date's reaction is subjective. It's a communication issue rather than a clear mistake.\n"
