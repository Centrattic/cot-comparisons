I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting his waitress's manager about her service, which upset his date. The key points here are the context of the situation and the motivations behind the action.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to praise the waitress for excellent service. That's a positive action, right? But the date didn't take it well. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that the author was trying to impress her in a backhanded way. The author mentioned he was close to asking her to be his girlfriend, so maybe the date was looking for a more personal gesture instead of going to the manager. \n\nBut wait, complimenting someone's job isn't inherently wrong. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. The issue seems to be that the date didn't like being impressed through a third party. The author might have thought that public recognition was a good way to show appreciation, but the date might have felt it was over the top or inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the date felt the author was trying to one-up her or show off his own generosity. Or perhaps she didn't like that the attention was given to the waitress instead of her. The author's intention was genuine praise, but the effect was negative in the context of their relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible he didn't mean to do anything wrong, but the action still hurt the date. If the intention was good but the result was negative, does that make him at fault? Or is it up to the date to see the gesture as positive? The question is whether the action itself was wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nIn such cases, sometimes it's about mismatched expectations. The author might not be at fault for a genuine compliment but could have been unaware of his date's preferences. However, if the date felt it was a mistake, maybe the author should have considered her feelings more in the moment. But the act of giving a compliment isn't inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently. But the question is strictly about being in the wrong, not about handling it better. \n\nHmm. So the answer depends on whether the action itself was wrong. Since the author intended to praise the waitress and did so appropriately, the action itself is not wrong. The date's reaction was a personal issue, not necessarily the author's fault. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
