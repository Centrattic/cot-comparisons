I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress provided great service, even after spilling a glass of water but handling it well. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager, which he did. However, his date was upset by this action and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether complimenting the waitress was inappropriate. The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to acknowledge good service. It's a common practice to give positive feedback to employees, especially when they do a good job. The waitress was happy with the compliment, so that part seems fine. The manager appreciated the feedback too, so that's a positive outcome.\n\nNow, the date was upset. Maybe she felt that he was trying to impress her by doing something grand, which might have come off as self-centered. But the author's intention was to praise the waitress, not to show off. However, in the context of a date, actions can have dual meanings. The girl might have felt that he was trying to take credit or that he was being overly formal in a situation where they were supposed to be focused on each other. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the girl felt that he was overstepping by involving the manager for a compliment. But usually, complimenting a server is a nice gesture and is encouraged. It's not like he was making a big scene; he just wanted to pass along positive feedback. \n\nThe author apologized and wanted to continue the relationship, but there's no response. The problem here is more about differing expectations. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the action itself, but perhaps he didn't consider his date's perspective. However, the action itself is neutral to positive. So the author isn't in the wrong. The girl's reaction is subjective, but the action isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
