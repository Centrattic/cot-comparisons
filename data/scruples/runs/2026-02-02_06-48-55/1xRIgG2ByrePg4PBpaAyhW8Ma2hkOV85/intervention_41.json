I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person went on a date, had good service from a waitress, and then told the manager she did a great job. But their date was upset and called them an asshole. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by going through her manager. That's a common way to give feedback, right? But their date took offense. Why? The author's action was meant as a positive, so why the negative reaction?\n\nPossible angles: Maybe the date felt left out or that the author was trying to show off or seek approval through praising someone else. Or perhaps the date wanted the author's attention focused on her instead. Maybe the act of involving the manager made it seem like the author was trying to be grandiose or overstep. \n\nThe author's intention was clear: they wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good service. The waitress herself was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. There's no indication that the author's action was inappropriate in the restaurant context. However, the date's reaction suggests a personal misunderstanding or a different expectation in the relationship dynamic.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the action itself was positive and appropriate. The problem arose in how it affected the date. But does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. The author didn't do anything wrong by giving the waitress a compliment through the manager. However, maybe they could have complimented the waitress directly instead of involving the manager, which might have been a more personal touch and avoided any possible misinterpretation. \n\nThe date's reaction is about their own feelings, not the author's mistake. So the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. The correct response is B.\n"
