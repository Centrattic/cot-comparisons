I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The author got called an asshole by their date for doing this, and now they're confused.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple went out to dinner, the waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave positive feedback. The date was upset, thinking this was an attempt to impress her and that the author was being full of himself. The date didn't respond to follow-up texts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side: He was trying to do a good deed by praising the waitress. Complimenting service staff is generally a positive action. He handled it professionally, went through the manager as the proper channel. There's no indication that his action was inappropriate or that he exaggerated. The waitress appreciated the compliment. \n\nFrom the date's perspective: She might have felt that the author was trying to show off or manipulate the situation to look better. Maybe she didn't like that he took the initiative to compliment the staff without her input, or she found the gesture unnecessary. It's possible she felt it was a ploy to impress her, hence the reaction. However, her response seems harsh given that it was a positive action. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing on the author's part? He didn't do anything negative to the waitress; in fact, he helped her. The date's reaction is subjective. The author's action was good, but perhaps he didn't consider the date's feelings in that moment. However, the situation doesn't indicate that he did anything objectively wrong. \n\nPossible issues: Maybe the timing or the method? He asked to see the manager, which might have drawn attention, but that's standard for feedback. The spill was handled well, so the compliment is valid. The date's dissatisfaction is more about their relationship dynamics than the action itself. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake might be in the date's perception, though. The author acted appropriately. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
