I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wanted to compliment their waitress by talking to the manager, but their date was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met a girl online, they had several good dates, and were on their third dinner. The waitress provided great service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her to the manager, so they asked for the manager and gave the waitress a compliment. The date was unimpressed, called the author an asshole (or similar), and now there's no response. The author is confused and thinks maybe they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress, which could come off as trying to show off or prioritize others over their own date. But is that actually the case? The author's intention was to commend the waitress, which is a good thing. However, the way it was done might have been problematic. For example, maybe the author didn't acknowledge their date's feelings or made the date feel ignored. \n\nThe waitress was doing her job well, and commendations are usually appreciated. So the action itself isn't wrong. But in the context of a date, if the date felt sidelined, that could be an issue. The author might have been so focused on the waitress that they didn't consider their date's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to do something positive and might not have realized how it affected the date. The date's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving the compliment in a way that included their date, or mentioning the waitress's good service to the date first before approaching the manager. \n\nBut is the author truly in the wrong? Complimenting someone else on their job isn't necessarily wrong. It's possible that the date had personal issues or is overly sensitive. The author's intent was positive, so maybe they're not in the wrong. However, maybe they should have been more considerate of their date's feelings in that moment. \n\nSo, the key question is whether the author's action of complimenting the waitress to the manager was inappropriate in the context of their date with the girl. If the action itself is neutral (complimenting service is good) but the execution ignored the date's presence or feelings, then the author might have a share of the blame. However, if the date's reaction is overblown, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) and B (not in the wrong). The author's intention was positive, but the way they did it could have been considerate of their date. Maybe they should have first told the date how good the service was, then gone to the manager. But the act of complimenting the waitress isn't inherently wrong. The date's reaction might be a personal issue. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
