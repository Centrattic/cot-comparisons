I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The author got called an asshole by his date for doing that, and now he's confused because he thought it was a nice gesture.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was on a date, the waitress provided good service, even when there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author then told the manager he wanted to speak, got the manager, and praised the waitress. The date didn't like it, thought he was full of himself, and things ended awkwardly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. The possible angles here are about the date's reaction versus the author's intention. The author's intention was clearly positive\u2014complimenting the waitress. But the date took it the wrong way, possibly thinking he was trying to impress her, which backfired.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. Praising a server is usually a good thing. However, in a date setting, maybe the act of going out of the way to tell the manager could be seen as unnecessary or self-centered. The date might have felt that the author was more focused on the waitress's reaction than on her. It's possible that the date expected the compliment to be given directly to the waitress instead of involving the manager, which might have been perceived as grandstanding.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have overstepped by involving the manager. While intending to give a compliment, doing so through the manager could make the waitress uncomfortable, especially if she's shy about recognition. But the waitress did seem happy in the story.\n\nAlso, the date's reaction is key. The author's action led to her feeling unimpressed or disrespected. The question is whether the author was wrong to not anticipate her possible negative reaction. If the author's action was genuinely meant to be kind but the date felt it was inconsiderate, is that the author's fault?\n\nIn AITA cases, it's often about perspective. The author's action is positive in intent but might have been executed in a way that didn't consider the date's feelings. The date might have wanted the author to focus on her during the date instead of the waitress. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the date's reaction is valid, then maybe the author is in the right because his action was positive, but if the action was inconsiderate, then he's at fault.\n\nI think the key here is that the author did something good but perhaps in a way that the date found inconsiderate. The answer might depend on whether the method was appropriate. Since the waitress was happy, maybe the author isn't wrong. The date's reaction is subjective, but the author's action wasn't malicious. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have known better than to draw attention away from his date. However, typically, praising service staff is seen as a positive. So, likely B.\n"
