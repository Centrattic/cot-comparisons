I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which upset his date. The situation is that they were on a third date, and the guy wanted to praise the waitress. The date didn't like it and accused him of being full of himself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author's action was to go out of his way to commend the waitress's service. He approached the manager to give positive feedback, which is generally a good thing. But the date took offense. Why would she do that?\n\nPossible reasons the date was upset: Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by doing something grand, but she found it unnecessary or self-centered. Alternatively, maybe she didn't want him to draw attention to himself in public, or perhaps she was uncomfortable with the situation. It's also possible she had a different expectation of how to spend the date and felt this was a waste of time or effort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, complimenting someone's work is usually a positive action. The waitress was good, and he wanted to recognize her efforts. That seems appropriate. However, maybe the way he did it could have been different. Instead of going to the manager, he could have just thanked the waitress directly. But in some cases, people prefer to go through management to ensure the feedback is properly noted.\n\nThe key points are: The author's action was a positive one, the date's reaction was negative, but the author's intention wasn't harmful. The date's perspective is that he was trying to impress her in a way she didn't appreciate. However, unless there was some prior context or specific expectations the date had, the author didn't do anything wrong. It's more a matter of differing opinions on how to handle the situation rather than a clear moral wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He did something kind and appropriate, and the date's reaction doesn't make his action wrong. The issue is more about compatibility in how they handle such situations rather than a fault on the author's part.\n"
