I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job. The situation is that the author and their date went to a burger place, had good service, including a minor spill that the waitress handled well. The author then asked to speak to the manager to compliment the waitress, which the date didn't appreciate and called them an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: the author's action was to compliment the waitress via the manager. The date was upset and thought the author was trying to impress her in a way that didn't work. The author is confused because they thought it was a kind gesture.\n\nFirst, is complimenting someone's service inappropriate? Generally, no. People often appreciate being told when they do a good job. The waitress was friendly and handled the spill gracefully. The author's action seems positive.\n\nBut why was the date upset? Maybe she thought the author was trying to show off or was self-centered. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or even condescending. Or perhaps she didn't like the attention to the waitress, maybe feeling overlooked or that the author was trying to gain favor through the compliment.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes gestures that are meant to be kind can be misinterpreted. The date might have felt that the author was trying to use the compliment to impress her, which didn't come across as genuine. Alternatively, maybe the date was having a bad night or had other issues that made her react negatively.\n\nThe author apologized and the date hasn't responded. So the question is whether the author was wrong. The answer would depend on whether the action itself was wrong, regardless of the other person's reaction. Since complimenting good service is a positive action, the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is her own issue, possibly unrelated to the author's action. However, maybe the way the author did it was awkward. For example, maybe the author should have just complimented the waitress directly instead of going through the manager. But even then, the intention was good.\n\nTherefore, the author's action isn't wrong. The problem here is more about the date's personal feelings rather than the author's mistake. So the answer is B (No).\n"
