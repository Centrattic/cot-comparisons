I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nSo, the scenario: the author and their date went to dinner. The waitress provided great service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so they asked to speak to the manager and gave a positive review. The date was upset, thinking the author was trying to impress her by being self-important. The author now feels confused and seeks opinions.\n\nFirst, is there any reason the author would be at fault? The waitress did a good job, and the author is recognizing her efforts. That's a positive action. But the date took offense. Why? Maybe she felt that the author didn't need to involve the manager for a compliment, or perhaps she was annoyed that the author was trying to showcase good manners or kindness in front of her. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or even condescending. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the action was appropriate and well-intentioned, then no. However, the author might not have considered their date's feelings. If the date was more focused on the couple's interaction and didn't appreciate the author's focus on the waitress, that could be a misstep in social cues. However, complimenting a server to a manager is a common and respectful practice. It's not inherently wrong. \n\nThe key points: The waitress deserved the praise, the author did it respectfully, and the date's reaction was unexpected. The author didn't do anything inappropriate. The date's reaction might stem from her own perspective, not the author's wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
