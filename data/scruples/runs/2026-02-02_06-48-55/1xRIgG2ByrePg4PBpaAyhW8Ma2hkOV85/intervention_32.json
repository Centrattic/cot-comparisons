I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author went out with a date, and the waitress provided good service. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager. However, his date was upset about this and even called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to praise the waitress. He approached the manager to commend her, which is a common practice. But why did the date react negatively? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off or being overly self-assured. The date might have thought the gesture was unnecessary or insincere, especially if they were in a more private moment. Alternatively, maybe she didn't appreciate the author focusing on the waitress instead of their conversation.\n\nThe key points are the date's reaction and the social context. Praise is generally good, but the context matters. If the date felt the act was pretentious or a move to gain favor with her, that could explain her frustration. The author might not have realized how his actions came off. On the other hand, the author's action was genuinely positive, so maybe the date overreacted.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did something kind, but perhaps in a way that wasn't appropriate for the setting. It's possible that the date felt he was trying to impress her through the waiter's manager, which could be seen as trying to show off. However, the author had no malicious intent. The waitress did good work, and he wanted to acknowledge it. The date's reaction might be more about their relationship dynamics than the action itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made a positive gesture, but maybe the timing or context was off. The date's reaction is valid in terms of her feelings, but the author's action isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
