I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to his date being upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's action was to praise the waitress to her manager. Typically, giving feedback\u2014positive or negative\u2014isn't wrong. The waitress handled a spill gracefully, and the author wanted to commend her. That seems reasonable. However, the date was upset. Why?\n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off, maybe being overly eager to please or not focused on her. She could have thought he was trying to be the best customer to look good in front of her, rather than focusing on their date. Alternatively, she might have found it unnecessary or even arrogant, thinking he was taking credit for the waitress's good service.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? The action itself was positive. Praise is usually appreciated. The manager and waitress were happy. The issue is the girlfriend's reaction. However, the author's intention was to commend good service, not to impress the date. The date's reaction might be more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the author's action being wrong. \n\nSo, if the user is asking whether complimenting the waitress was wrong, the answer would likely be no. The author did something good, but the date had her own issues with it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
