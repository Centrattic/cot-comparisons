I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author complimented the waitress's manager on her service, but his date got upset and called him an asshole. The author is confused because he thought it was a nice thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author wanted to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. He approached the manager to give feedback, which is a common way to commend someone's service. The waitress did a good job, even after spilling the water, so the author's intention was to recognize her effort. \n\nThe date's reaction was unexpected. She felt it was self-serving or maybe she didn't appreciate the attention given to the waitress. Maybe she thought the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the staff, but it backfired. Or perhaps she felt it was unnecessary or made her feel excluded. \n\nNow, considering if the author was in the wrong. Complimenting someone's work is generally a good deed. The author didn't do anything harmful. However, maybe the way he did it wasn't appropriate in the context of a date. But the story says he did it calmly and the waitress was happy. The manager appreciated the feedback. \n\nThe date's reaction might be due to her own insecurities or misinterpretation. The author's action was genuine, but it's possible that his date had different expectations for their time together. However, the author had no malicious intent. The waitress's job is to provide good service, so recognizing her work is valid. \n\nThere's no evidence the author did anything wrong. The waitress and manager were grateful. The problem lies in the date's perception. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
