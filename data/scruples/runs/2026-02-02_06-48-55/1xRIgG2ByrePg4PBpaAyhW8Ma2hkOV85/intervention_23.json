I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job. The situation is that the author met a girl online, they went on dates, and on the third date, the author went out of their way to compliment the waitress to her manager. The date didn't go well after that, and the girl was upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dynamics here. The author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. However, the date turned sour because the girl was unimpressed and called the author an asshole. The key points are whether the author's action was inappropriate in the context of the date. \n\nSome people might argue that the author's decision to inform the manager was unnecessary or showed off their own generosity. Others might think that complimenting good service is a normal thing to do and that the girl overreacted. But maybe during a date, the focus is on the partner, and bringing attention to a service staff could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have made the girl feel like they were trying to impress the waitress or the manager instead of their date. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to acknowledge good service, which is a genuine action. The waitress handled a minor incident well, so the author's feedback was positive. The fact that the girl was upset could be due to personal reasons unrelated to the action itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The action itself is commendable, but in the context of a date, maybe the timing or the manner was off. The author might have prioritized giving feedback over focusing on their date, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, the girl's reaction might be over a misinterpretation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action disrupted the date or was a genuine compliment. Since the author's intention was positive, but it led to a negative outcome in the relationship, some might say the author is not in the wrong. Others might say that during a date, the focus should be on the date partner, not giving feedback to staff. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that praising service is a good deed and the issue is the date's reaction, the author's action itself isn't wrong. The problem might be the girl's overreaction. So, the answer is B.\n"
