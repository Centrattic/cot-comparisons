I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The story is that they were on a third date, had good service, the waitress spilled a glass but handled it well, and the author went to the manager to praise her. The date didn't like that and called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether praising someone in front of their manager is inappropriate, especially in a dating context. The author's intention was to compliment the waitress, but his date felt it was self-serving or maybe not the right move. Why would she be upset? Maybe she thought he was trying to show off or that it was unnecessary. \n\nOn one hand, the author did something positive\u2014recognizing good service. On the other hand, maybe in the context of a date, doing that in front of the manager could be seen as awkward or trying to impress the date in a way that's inconsiderate. The date might have felt that he was more focused on the waitress or the restaurant than on her, which could be a turn-off. \n\nBut is the author actually wrong? He didn't do anything negative. Complimenting someone's job should be a good thing. However, in the context of a date, the woman might have expected him to focus on her instead of another employee. Maybe she felt that he was trying to one-up the situation or that it was a cheap way to show off. But that's a bit subjective. \n\nAlternatively, the act of going to the manager could have been embarrassing for the waitress, but the story says the waitress was happy with the compliment. So maybe the date was just annoyed for another reason. \n\nI'm torn. The author's action was positive, but if the date felt it was inconsiderate, maybe he didn't read the social cues right. However, complimenting good service is generally a good thing. The fact that the waitress was appreciative supports that. The problem might be more about the date's expectations than the action itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was appropriate and the date's reaction is about her personal preferences, then maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if the action was inconsiderate in the context of the date, then maybe he is. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't do anything harmful or negative. Praising service is usually expected and appreciated. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings, so the author isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
