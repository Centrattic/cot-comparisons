I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager that she did a great job, which led to an argument with his date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went on a date, had good service, and wanted to compliment the waitress. However, instead of just thanking her directly, he went to the manager to give the compliment. His date took offense, feeling that this was pretentious or self-centered. The author is confused because he thought he was doing a kind thing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the main issue here is the method of giving the compliment. It's generally good to acknowledge good service, but doing so through the manager might be unnecessary. The waitress could have been praised directly. By going through the manager, the author might have made the situation awkward or seemed like he was trying to show off. The date's reaction suggests she felt it was an attempt to impress her, which backfired because it came off as self-centered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had no malicious intent. He was just trying to commend the waitress for excellent service. However, the way he did it might have been inappropriate in the context of a date. In a romantic setting, actions that seem excessive or attention-seeking can be misinterpreted, especially if the other person is sensitive to such gestures. The fact that the waitress was happy with the compliment might mean the author's action was positive in that regard, but the date's reaction indicates a personal conflict.\n\nConsidering cultural norms, people often appreciate direct compliments. Going through the manager might be seen as unnecessary formalities when a simple thank you to the waitress would suffice. The date might have felt that the author was trying to gain favor or show off, which led to her negative reaction.\n\nThe key points are the method of giving the compliment (indirect vs. direct), the possible misinterpretation of intent, and the context of a date where social dynamics are more delicate. While the author's intention was positive, the execution might have been flawed, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering his date's perspective and the appropriateness of the situation.\n"
