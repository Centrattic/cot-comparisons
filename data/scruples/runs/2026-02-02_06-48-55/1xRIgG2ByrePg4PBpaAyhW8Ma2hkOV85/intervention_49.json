I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told the waitress's manager she did a great job, but his date didn't appreciate it and thought it was arrogant.\n\nHmm, first, the author wanted to compliment the waitress for good service. That seems like a good intention. The waitress even handled a spill gracefully, so the author was recognizing her efforts. But his date took it the wrong way. Why would she be upset?\n\nMaybe the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by praising the waitress, which came off as self-centered. If the author was trying to highlight his own kindness or generosity, it might make the date feel like he's showing off. But did the author actually intend to impress the date? The story says he just wanted to give genuine feedback. \n\nOn the other hand, the date might have interpreted the action as the author being overly concerned with recognition or trying to appear generous in front of her. Sometimes people don't like when their date is too focused on others during a date, especially if it's perceived as trying to show off. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some contexts, giving a compliment to a server during a date could be seen as a gesture of kindness, but if the date is the focus, maybe the action took attention away from the date. However, the author's reason was sincere. \n\nThe waitress appreciated the compliment, and the manager was grateful. So the action was positive for the waitress. But the date perceived it as a negative. The question is whether the author was wrong to do it. \n\nI think it's more about the date's perception. The author didn't act with malicious intent. But maybe he should have considered how his date might feel. If the date was expecting a romantic gesture or a private moment, bringing in the manager might have disrupted that. \n\nHowever, the author had no intention of impressing the date. He just wanted to give a compliment. It's possible the date's reaction was overly sensitive. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer probably depends on whether the action was intended to impress the date or not. Since the author's intention was to commend the waitress, he's not in the wrong. The date's reaction might be her own issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
