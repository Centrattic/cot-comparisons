I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager. The situation is that the author wanted to praise the waitress, so they went through the manager. The date didn't like it and called the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intention and the context. The author wanted to give positive feedback, which is a good thing. But the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by doing so, which came off as arrogant. The waitress was doing a good job, so the compliment was genuine. However, maybe the way it was done was awkward. \n\nIn some cultures or relationships, public praise can be a positive thing. But maybe the date expected the author to handle the compliment differently, like just telling the waitress directly. The author went through the manager, which might have been unnecessary and could have been seen as showing off. \n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to gain her approval through third parties instead of focusing on their interaction. So, the problem isn't with the compliment itself, but perhaps with the method and the context of the date. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the intention was positive. However, the situation's interpretation is subjective. The date's reaction might be due to personal preferences rather than the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The author could have just given the compliment directly to the waitress, maybe. But going to the manager is still a valid way to give feedback. So, the author isn't wrong, but maybe could have handled it a bit more thoughtfully. But the main issue is the date's reaction, not the author's action being inherently wrong.\n"
