I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's unpack this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which upset his date.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his date went to a burger place. The waitress was good, even handled a spill gracefully. The author wanted to praise her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress a compliment. The date took offense, calling him an asshole. The author is confused and seeks opinions.\n\nNow, why would the date be upset? Possible reasons: She might have felt neglected because he was more focused on praising the waitress than on her. Or maybe she misinterpreted the action as trying to impress her, which could come off as insincere or trying to one-up her. Alternatively, she might think complimenting staff is unnecessary or that it's a way to show off wealth. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, complimenting good service is generally a positive thing. It's common for customers to appreciate good service. But in the context of a date, actions that shift attention away from the partner can be seen as inconsiderate. The date might feel that the author was more interested in the waitress or in showing off his own generosity. The key here is whether the action was thoughtless in the context of the relationship dynamics. \n\nThe author's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is reasonable. However, if the date felt slighted, the author might not have been aware of how his actions were perceived. It's possible he was trying to do a good thing, but the timing or the manner (going through the manager) might have been awkward. \n\nIn some cases, people might find it odd to go through the manager for a compliment, as usually people just talk to the server directly. But the method might not be the main issue. The main issue is that the action upset the date. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If he didn't intend to upset her but failed to consider her feelings, maybe partially at fault. But intentionally trying to impress her with a compliment might not be wrong. However, since the date felt it was inconsiderate, the author might have done something wrong by not considering her perspective. \n\nAlternatively, the date's reaction might be overreaching. Complimenting service is normal and perhaps the date is being overly sensitive. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, complimenting a server is fine. But in a dating context, actions that draw attention away from the partner can be problematic. So the author might have been inconsiderate, even if the action itself is neutral. \n\nTherefore, the answer hinges on whether the action was inconsiderate in the context. If the author didn't consider how his date would feel about him complimenting another employee in front of her, then he might be in the wrong. However, if it's just a difference in perception, then maybe not. \n\nGiven that the date took offense and the author didn't realize why, it's possible he was in the wrong for not anticipating her feelings. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
