I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they complimented their waitress's manager about the waitress's good service. The girlfriend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The main action here is the author complimenting the waitress. Typically, praising someone's job performance is a positive thing. But the girlfriend took offense. Why?\n\nThe author mentions that the waitress had a great service, even after a small mishap. The author wanted to commend her. That seems like a kind gesture. However, the girlfriend felt that this was done to impress her, which didn't work. She thought the author was being full of himself. \n\nSo why would the girlfriend be upset? Maybe she thought the author was trying to show off his generosity or his ability to give compliments, which could come off as self-centered. Alternatively, she might not have appreciated the attention being directed towards the waitress in front of her. \n\nIs the author at fault here? Well, the act of giving a compliment itself is not wrong. However, maybe the author didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective. If the intention was to impress her by being a good customer, but the method was awkward or misplaced, that could be a problem. On the other hand, if the intention was purely to commend the waitress, then it's a good deed, and the girlfriend's reaction is her own issue.\n\nThe key points are the intentions and whether the action was inappropriate. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service; giving positive feedback is good. The conflict arose from the girlfriend's interpretation of the action. Unless there's a cultural or situational context where that's not appropriate, it's a positive action.\n\nSo the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because complimenting someone's service is a good thing, and unless there's a specific reason it was inappropriate in their relationship context, the author isn't wrong here.\n"
