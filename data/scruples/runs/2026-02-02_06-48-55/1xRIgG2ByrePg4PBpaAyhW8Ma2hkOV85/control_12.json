I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after complimenting the waitress to her manager, and the date didn't take it well.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man wanted to compliment the waitress for her good service. He had a third date with a girl, and this action led to her being upset. The key points here are: the service was excellent, the spill wasn't the waitress's fault, and he genuinely wanted to commend her. \n\nHe approached the manager to give a positive review, which is a common practice. People often appreciate when others acknowledge good service. The waitress was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So, on the surface, the action seems positive. \n\nBut the date took offense. Why? Maybe she felt he was trying to impress her by showing off? The woman's reaction was that he was full of himself. Perhaps she didn't like that he prioritized complimenting a waitress over the date, or maybe she found it odd that he felt the need to go through the manager instead of just thanking her directly. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the woman was already having doubts or looking for reasons to end things, and this became a point of contention. The man's intentions were good, but the woman interpreted it negatively. \n\nIs he wrong? If the action was genuine and appropriate, then the issue is more about the woman's reaction. However, maybe there's a cultural or social expectation he overlooked. For example, does complimenting a waitress in front of a date come off as inconsiderate? It might depend on context. Since he was being polite and appreciative, it's hard to see how that's wrong. \n\nBut since the date was important to him, maybe he should have considered her perspective. If he wanted to impress her, maybe a direct compliment to the waitress in front of her would have been better. However, the method he used\u2014talking to the manager\u2014might have been the standard way to give a formal commendation. \n\nIn conclusion, the man's action was appropriate and positive. The woman's reaction might stem from personal issues rather than the act itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
