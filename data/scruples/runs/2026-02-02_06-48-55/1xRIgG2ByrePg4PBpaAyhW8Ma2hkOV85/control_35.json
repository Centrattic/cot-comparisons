I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager. The situation is that the author and their date went to dinner, and the waitress did a good job, including handling a spill. The author wanted to praise her service by talking to the manager. The date was upset and accused the author of being full of himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was trying to give positive feedback, which is generally a good thing. Complimenting someone's work can be a kind gesture. However, the date took it negatively. Why would that be? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that the author was showing off. \n\nThe waitress was doing her job well, and the author wanted to acknowledge that. The manager appreciated the feedback. So from an objective standpoint, the author isn't wrong for praising good service. But the date's reaction is part of the scenario. The question is whether the author did something wrong in the context of their relationship.\n\nIt's possible that the date felt the gesture was meant to impress her, and she saw it as the author trying to show off or be self-centered. If that's the case, maybe the author's intention wasn't malicious, but the action came across as self-serving in her eyes. However, the author's intent was to commend the waitress, not to impress the date. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the act itself\u2014praising good service\u2014is correct. The date's reaction is her issue. Unless there's a cultural or personal norm they violated, the author's action isn't wrong. The problem might be a miscommunication between the two of them about intentions. The author tried to be kind, but the date interpreted it negatively. So the fault isn't with the author for doing something right, but perhaps on the date for misinterpreting the gesture. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
