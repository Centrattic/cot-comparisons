I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the manager that the waitress did a great job, which led to the date being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was on a date and wanted to compliment the waitress by telling the manager. The waitress had good service, even when she accidentally spilled water but handled it well. The author went to the manager to praise her, but the date got upset, thinking it was an attempt to impress her. The date called the author an asshole and hasn't responded after he apologized.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Complimenting a waitress is usually a good thing. But the context here is a date. Maybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off or wasn't focused on her. The author might have misread the situation. The date's reaction suggests she didn't appreciate the public praise or felt it was unnecessary. \n\nOn one hand, the author was just trying to do something kind. On the other hand, the date might have felt it was inconsiderate, perhaps because the author didn't consider her feelings or if it was appropriate to bring in the manager. Maybe the date thought the author was trying to impress others instead of her. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was positive, but the date's reaction was negative. The question is whether the author's action was inconsiderate. Since the date was upset, but the author had no malicious intent, it's a bit of a grey area. However, in dating situations, actions that might seem positive can sometimes have unintended consequences. The author might have overlooked the date's possible feelings in the moment. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because complimenting service staff is a good deed. But maybe the timing or the way it was done could have been better. However, the answer depends on whether the action itself was wrong, not the outcome. Since the action was well-intentioned, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
