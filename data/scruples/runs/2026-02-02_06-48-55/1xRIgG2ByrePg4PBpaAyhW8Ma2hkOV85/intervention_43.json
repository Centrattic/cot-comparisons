I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The main conflict is between the author's action and the date's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author did something positive by praising the waitress. That seems like a good thing. But the date took offense and called the author an asshole. Why would that be?\n\nPossible angles: The date might have felt that the compliment was meant to impress her, maybe she thought the author was trying to show off or was being self-serving. The author's action could have been perceived as unnecessary or awkward. For example, maybe the date felt that complimenting the waitress in front of the manager was an attempt to be a \"good person\" in the date's eyes, which could come off as insincere or trying too hard. Alternatively, maybe the date was uncomfortable with the attention given to the waitress, even if it was just a compliment.\n\nThe author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which is a positive action. But the date's reaction suggests that the method or timing was off. The author had to go through the process of getting the manager, which might have interrupted the date or made the date feel like the author was prioritizing the waitress's recognition over the date's experience. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the action itself is good, but the context of a date might require more consideration of the other person's feelings. If the date felt that the compliment was an attempt to impress her, even if it wasn't, then the author might have misread the situation. However, the author didn't have ill intent. It's possible that the date was more sensitive or had a different expectation. \n\nIn such cases, the line between a kind gesture and an awkward one can be thin. The author's action was well-meaning, but it's possible that the date interpreted it as self-serving. The question is whether the author's action was inherently wrong. Since the author's intention was positive and the action itself was good, the mistake might be in not considering how the date would perceive it. But is that the author's fault? Or is it about differing perspectives?\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. The key is the intention versus the impact. The answer would depend on whether the action itself is wrong or if it's a miscommunication. Since the action was a compliment, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation highlights a communication issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
