I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a guy complimenting his waitress's service and then telling the manager how great she was. His date got upset about it. The guy is confused because he thought it was a kind thing to do. The girl called him an asshole for it. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy and the girl were on their third date. He wanted to treat her to dinner and thought complimenting the waitress was a nice gesture. The waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill. The guy went to the manager to praise her, which is a common way to give feedback. \n\nBut the girl didn't like it. She said it didn't impress her and called him arrogant. Now the user is asking if he's wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. From a social perspective, complimenting someone's service is usually seen as positive. However, dates can be different. Maybe the girl felt that the guy was trying to show off by complimenting the waitress in front of management, or perhaps she thought he was trying to impress her in a way that was unnecessary. \n\nIs there a cultural norm here? In some contexts, people might feel uncomfortable if someone takes the time to praise a service staff member during a date, especially if it's not directed at them. It might be seen as a distraction from the date or perceived as trying to impress the date by showing off good manners or generosity, which could come off as self-centered.\n\nBut on the other hand, the guy's intention was to commend the waitress. He didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job. The issue here is between him and his date. The girl's reaction is subjective. Whether he's in the wrong depends on why she was upset. If he was trying to be kind and it backfired because of her personal preferences, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But if he was trying to impress her by making a big deal out of it, that could be seen as arrogant.\n\nThe key here is the communication breakdown. The guy didn't understand her reaction. He thought it was a positive action, but she felt it was boastful. Without her explaining further, it's hard to say if he was wrong. However, generally, complimenting service staff is a good thing. Unless he was doing it in a way that was inconsiderate to her (like making a scene), he's probably not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the act of going to the manager in front of the waitress made her feel like he was trying to get credit for praising her. Or she might have wanted the attention on her instead. That could be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, unless there's a rule against complimenting service staff, the guy isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about their personal dynamics. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not just whether his actions were socially acceptable in all contexts. Since the action itself (praising good service) is positive, and the conflict arose from the girl's personal reaction, the author isn't at fault. So answer B.\n"
