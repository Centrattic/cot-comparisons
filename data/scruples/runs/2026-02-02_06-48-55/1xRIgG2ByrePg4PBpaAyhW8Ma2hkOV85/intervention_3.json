I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the person complimenting their waitress to her manager, which led their date to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible reasons why the date might have been unimpressed. The author mentions that the waitress was excellent, but the date might feel like the author is trying to show off. Maybe the date thought the author was trying to impress her by giving feedback to the manager, which could come off as self-centered. The fact that the waitress was already doing a good job, and the author took the step to tell the manager, might make it seem like the author is taking credit for the waitress's performance or trying to highlight their own generosity, which the date didn't appreciate.\n\nOn the other hand, complimenting a service worker is a kind and positive action. It's a way to recognize good work, which is commendable. The author might have intended to do something thoughtful, not to impress the date. The waitress's reaction was happy, so maybe the author's action was good in the broader context but misread by the date.\n\nI should also think about social norms here. Giving a compliment to a manager about a staff member's service is a common practice and usually seen as a good thing. However, in a date setting, the focus is on the two people involved. The date might have felt that the author didn't prioritize the date's importance over giving a compliment, even if it was well-intentioned. \n\nThe key points are the intention of the author and how the date perceived it. The author's intention was to praise the waitress for good service, which is right. But the date might have interpreted it as the author trying to appear generous or important, thereby overshadowing the date itself. So while the action itself is not wrong, the context of a date might make the timing or the situation inappropriate. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the action was inappropriate in that specific setting. If the date wanted the attention to be on their interaction, then the author's action might be seen as a mistake. However, if the author's intention was purely to commend the waitress and not to impress the date, then they might not be wrong. \n\nIn the end, the date's reaction is a sign that it was perceived negatively, so even if the action is normally right, in this context it might have been the wrong move. So the author could be in the wrong based on how the date interpreted the action, even if they didn't mean to be self-centered.\n"
