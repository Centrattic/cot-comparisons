I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they both liked each other. The waitress was really good, even though there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress praise. The girl got upset, thinking he was trying to impress her and came off as full of himself. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The author did something positive\u2014praising the waitress. That's usually a good thing. But the context matters here. He did it in front of the manager and the waitress in front of his date. Maybe the girl felt that he was trying to show off his generosity or maybe she didn't like that he was interacting with another woman, even if it was just a compliment. Jealousy could be a factor here. But is the author wrong for complimenting the waitress appropriately?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions were good. He didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job or his date's feelings. However, maybe the timing or the way he did it was off. Like, if he was trying to impress his date by giving a compliment, that could come off as self-centered. But the author says he just wanted to acknowledge the good service, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girl's reaction seems a bit harsh. But maybe she had her own insecurities or misinterpreted his intentions. The author didn't do anything that's a mistake in itself; complimenting service staff is a positive action. Unless there's some hidden context, like the waitress was his date's friend or something, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment. The problem might be in how his date took it, but that's on her. The author's action was appropriate. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
