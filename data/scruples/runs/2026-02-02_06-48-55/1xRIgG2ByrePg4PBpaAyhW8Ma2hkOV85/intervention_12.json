I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress was really good, except for a minor spill that wasn't her fault. At the end, the author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager. The date didn't like that and thought it was self-centered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. He wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good service, which is a positive thing. He didn't have any bad intentions, just wanted to give a compliment. That seems reasonable. Maybe he thought it would be a nice surprise for the waitress and a good way to show appreciation for good service. \n\nNow, the girl's reaction. She felt that it was meant to impress her and that he was full of himself. Why would she think that? Maybe she felt like he was trying to show off or use the compliment as a way to gain points with her. If they were getting close to a relationship, perhaps she felt this was unnecessary or even a bit presumptuous. She might have expected a more private way of showing appreciation instead of involving the manager. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the author's action wasn't harmful. He was just being polite and appreciative. However, in the context of a date, the girl might have felt that he was trying to impress her indirectly, which could come off as self-centered. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his date would perceive the action. In a relationship or dating context, actions are often interpreted in the context of the relationship dynamics. \n\nThe key point is whether the author overstepped. Complimenting service staff is generally a good thing, but if the person you're with feels that it's an unnecessary show of self-importance, then maybe there's a misunderstanding. The girl's reaction was to call him an asshole, which is strong, but her reasoning might be based on her own feelings about how he was trying to use the compliment to impress her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he had no intention of impressing her and just wanted to appreciate the waitress, then technically he's not in the wrong. But if the context of the date made her feel that he was trying to show off, maybe he should have considered her feelings more before doing that in front of the manager. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of his actions being unethical or harmful, but perhaps he misjudged the social situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his action was inappropriate. Since complimenting the waitress is a good thing, and the issue is more about the date's perception, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here where in a date setting, considering the partner's feelings is important. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author is in the right because he was just being kind and appreciative. The girl's reaction is her own issue. So, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But others might say that he should have considered how his action would affect the date's perception. However, the action isn't inherently wrong. So probably the answer is B.\n"
