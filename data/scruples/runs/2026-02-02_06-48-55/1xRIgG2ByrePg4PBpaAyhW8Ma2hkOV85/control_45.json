I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The key points here are the context of the date and the reaction from the date.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to compliment the waitress for good service. They went through the waitress to get the manager and then gave positive feedback. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager thanked them. So on the surface, that seems like a positive action. But the date didn't like it and felt it was an attempt to impress her, which backfired.\n\nNow, why would the date react negatively? Maybe she thought the author was trying to one-up her by showing off that he's the type to give compliments, or perhaps she felt it was a bit over-the-top for a casual burger place. Some people might find public praise or managerial feedback as unnecessary, especially if it's in a context where they're on a date. It could come off as trying to impress rather than genuine.\n\nBut the author's intention was to acknowledge good service. However, in a date setting, actions can be interpreted differently. The date might have felt that the author was more focused on external validation or showing off than on the quality time they were sharing. Alternatively, maybe she felt uncomfortable with the attention drawn to the waitress, even if it was just a compliment.\n\nAnother angle: the author did the right thing by recognizing good service, which is a positive trait. But in a personal context, sometimes such gestures can be misread. The problem isn't the act itself but the interpretation by the date. So the author's action might not be wrong per se, but the date's reaction might stem from her own expectations or insecurities.\n\nIs the author wrong for complimenting the waitress? If the intention was genuine, then probably not. But in the context of the date, if the date perceived it as trying to impress her, maybe the timing or the method was off. However, the author didn't do anything inappropriate. The waitress was appreciated, and the manager was informed. The issue is more about the date's perception and their relationship dynamics rather than the author's actions themselves.\n\nSo the answer hinges on whether complimenting service staff is inherently wrong in a date setting. Since it's a positive action, the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is a personal one, not necessarily the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
