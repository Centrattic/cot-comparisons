I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author went on a third date with a girl, and they had dinner. The waitress was doing a good job, even when there was a minor spill, which she handled well. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by telling her manager, so he asked to speak to the manager. The waitress thought there was a problem, but the author just gave a positive review. However, the date got upset and called the author an asshole, saying he was full of himself.\n\nHmm, why would the date be upset? Maybe she didn't like that he took the time to speak to the manager instead of focusing on her. The author thought it was a nice gesture to commend the waitress, but perhaps the date felt it was unnecessary or even a bit showy. The author apologized, but she hasn't responded.\n\nSo the question is whether the author did something wrong. On one hand, complimenting good service is a positive action, and many people appreciate when others acknowledge good work. On the other hand, maybe the timing or the way it was done was inappropriate in the context of a date. If the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off his ability to give compliments, that could be an issue. But the author's intention was genuine, not to impress but to thank the waitress. However, the date's reaction suggests that she had a different interpretation.\n\nI think it's possible the author misunderstood the social context. While complimenting service is good, doing so in front of a date might have been seen as prioritizing the waitress over the date. Maybe the date wanted the author's full attention and felt that the author was splitting it. Alternatively, maybe the date felt the author was trying to be overly polite in a way that wasn't needed, which could come off as smug. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's intent versus the date's perception. If the author's intention was sincere and the date still felt it was a negative, then perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, but the date's reaction is subjective. However, if the action disrupted the date's experience or made her feel unimportant, then maybe the author should have considered her feelings more. But since the waitress was doing a good job and the author was just trying to give her due, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the action itself was positive, but maybe he could have handled it differently, like doing it after the date left. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the date's reaction is based on personal feelings rather than the action being objectively wrong, then the author isn't at fault. So the answer might be B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the date's unhappiness was valid, then maybe A. But I think the action itself isn't wrong, so B.\n"
