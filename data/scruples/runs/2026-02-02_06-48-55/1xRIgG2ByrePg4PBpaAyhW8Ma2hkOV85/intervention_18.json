I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, leading to his date being upset. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date, had good service from the waitress, and wanted to compliment her by speaking to the manager. The waitress even handled a minor spill gracefully. The date didn't like this action and called the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. Why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by giving the compliment, or perhaps she thought it was unnecessary or awkward. The author mentions he was planning to ask her to be his girlfriend, so maybe the date was expecting a more personal gesture instead of a public compliment to a staff member.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might believe that the author overstepped by involving the manager for a compliment, or that it was an attempt to show off. Others might argue that complimenting good service is a kind gesture and not the date's issue.\n\nBut why did the date react negatively? Maybe she found it presumptuous or felt that the author was trying to gain favor through third parties. Alternatively, she might have been uncomfortable with the attention drawn to the waitress. \n\nThe author's intention was clearly to commend the waitress, which is a positive action. However, the context of a date might mean that such actions are misinterpreted. If the date felt this was a move to impress her, and it came off as insincere or self-centered, then perhaps the author didn't consider her perspective. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Complimenting someone's work is generally seen as a good thing. Unless there was a specific reason the date disliked it, like past experiences or personal preferences, the author's action might be neutral. The date's reaction is subjective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo, the key points are the intention vs. the perception. The author did something kind, but it might have been misinterpreted. Whether that's the author's fault depends on whether they should have anticipated the date's reaction. Since the author didn't realize it would upset her, maybe he isn't in the wrong. The problem might lie in communication rather than the action itself. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The gesture was positive, and the date's reaction is more about personal feelings rather than the action's correctness.\n"
