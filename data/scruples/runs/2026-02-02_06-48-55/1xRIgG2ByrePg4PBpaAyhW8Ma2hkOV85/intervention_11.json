I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to the date being upset. The author's friend group might think he's in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's actually the case.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date, had good service, and wanted to commend the waitress. He asked to speak to the manager and gave a positive review. The date reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. The author is confused because he thought it was a kind gesture.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Intent vs. Perception**: The author intended to praise the waitress, which is a good thing. However, the date felt that this was an attempt to impress her, which might have come off as insincere or self-centered. Maybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off his ability to give compliments or manipulate the situation to look good in front of her.\n\n2. **Context of the Relationship**: They were on their third date, and the author was close to proposing a relationship. The date might have felt that this gesture was a ploy to gain favor or that he was more focused on others than on her. It could be that she expected the attention to be on her during the date, and the compliment to the waitress, even if well-meaning, was seen as a misstep.\n\n3. **Cultural or Social Norms**: In some contexts, complimenting someone else in front of a romantic interest might be misinterpreted. However, in many cases, praising service staff is a common courtesy and shouldn't be a problem. The key is whether the action was inconsiderate given the setting.\n\n4. **Reaction Proportionality**: The date's reaction was strong\u2014calling him an asshole and not responding to follow-up texts. Whether her reaction is justified depends on her perspective. If she felt disrespected or that he was trying to manipulate the situation, her anger might be based on personal insecurities or expectations rather than the action itself.\n\n5. **The Waitress's Reaction**: The waitress was happy with the compliment, so the action was positive for her. The problem was between the author and his date. The author didn't do anything wrong towards the waitress, but the issue is with how the date perceived his actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the intention was genuine to commend the waitress, then he's not at fault. However, in a date setting, sometimes people expect the focus to be on them. If the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by being nice to the waitress, that's more about her interpretation than his action. The author didn't do anything objectively wrong, but his action might have been misaligned with the date's expectations. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's possible he didn't consider the date's perspective. The key is that complimenting service staff is a positive action, and the problem lies in the date's reaction rather than the author's intent. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
