I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, they had dinner, and he wanted to compliment the waitress by telling her manager how great she was. The date got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. He wanted to commend the waitress for good service, which is a positive thing. The waitress had a minor spill but handled it well. He approached the manager to give her kudos. That seems like a kind and professional action. Normally, people are happy to receive compliments, so why was the date upset?\n\nHmm, maybe the girl felt that he was trying to impress her by doing something grand, or maybe she was uncomfortable with the attention. She didn't like it, thinking he was full of himself. But is the act itself wrong? Complimenting service staff is usually a good thing. The method\u2014telling the manager\u2014might have been unexpected, but not inappropriate. The waitress was happy, so he did the right thing in her eyes. The date's reaction is more about her feelings than his actions. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong here. The problem is between him and his date's perception. Therefore, answer B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
