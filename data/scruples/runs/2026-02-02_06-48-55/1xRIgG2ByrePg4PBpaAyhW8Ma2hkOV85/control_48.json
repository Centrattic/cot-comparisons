I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress was really good, except for a minor spill, but she handled it well. The author wanted to compliment the waitress, so he asked to speak to the manager and praised her in front of them. The date didn't like that and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the date was upset. Maybe she thought he was trying to show off or be self-centered by going through the manager instead of just giving a tip or telling the waitress directly. But the author did it to commend her service, which is a positive action. However, maybe the way he did it was unexpected or made the date uncomfortable. \n\nIn dating situations, sometimes people have different expectations. If the date was focused on their own connection, the author's action might have shifted attention away from them, making her feel ignored or like he was more interested in praising a stranger than engaging with her. That could be a point in her favor. \n\nBut on the other hand, complimenting a service worker is a kind and genuine action. It's not uncommon to leave feedback for good service, and doing it through the manager might be a standard way to ensure the staff gets proper recognition. The author didn't do anything negative; he just gave a compliment. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author's intent was to commend the waitress, which is a good deed. However, the date might have perceived it as the author trying to impress her by being generous or seeking attention. But if the date's reaction was immediate and negative, maybe she felt slighted or that the attention wasn't on her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of praising the waitress isn't inherently wrong. However, in a date setting, sometimes people expect the attention to be on each other. The date's reaction suggests that she might have felt the author was prioritizing the waitress's recognition over their interaction. But that's more about the date's feelings rather than the author's action being objectively wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He did a positive thing, and his actions were appropriate. The date's dissatisfaction is more about their relationship dynamics than his action. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
