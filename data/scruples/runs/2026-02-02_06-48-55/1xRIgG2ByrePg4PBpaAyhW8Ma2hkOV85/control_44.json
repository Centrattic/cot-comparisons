I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

So, the situation is that they went on a date, had good service from a waitress, and then told the manager she did a great job. The date didn't like that and called them an asshole.\n\nHmm, first, the author's intention was positive. They wanted to compliment the waitress for good service. That's a good thing, right? Complimenting service workers can be meaningful for them. The waitress even appreciated it, as she looked happy and thanked them. So the action itself wasn't wrong towards the waitress or the manager.\n\nBut the date took offense. Maybe she thought the author was trying to impress her by showing off their ability to give compliments or maybe she felt it was unnecessary. Sometimes people get annoyed when others try to be overly nice in their presence, thinking it's a ploy to look good. But is that a valid reason for the author to be in the wrong?\n\nThe key points here are the intention versus the effect. The author had a genuine intention to praise the waitress. The date's reaction was unexpected. Since the action was appropriate and the waitress appreciated it, the author wasn't wrong in doing that. The date's displeasure doesn't make the author wrong unless there was some social norm they violated. \n\nAlso, there's no indication the author did anything improper. Complimenting a server is a common and accepted practice. The date's reaction seems to be a personal preference or a misinterpretation. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
