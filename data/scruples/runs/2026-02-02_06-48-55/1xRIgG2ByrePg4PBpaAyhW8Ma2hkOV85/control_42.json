I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that the author and their date went to dinner, and the waitress did a great job, even after spilling a glass of water. The author wanted to give positive feedback, so they asked to speak to the manager and praised the waitress. However, the date was upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The waitress's service was excellent, and the spill wasn't her fault because she was bumped. She handled it well by apologizing and cleaning up. The author's intention was to commend her, which is typically a good thing. But the date didn't appreciate it. Why?\n\nPossible reasons the date was upset: Maybe she felt the attention should have been on her, the author, or the date. She might have thought the compliment to the waitress was unnecessary and took away from the romantic setting. Alternatively, she could have felt the author was trying to one-up her or show off by giving a compliment in front of the manager. Or perhaps she didn't like that the author wanted to engage with the manager instead of focusing on their date.\n\nHowever, the author's action of giving a positive review is a common way to appreciate good service. It's not inherently wrong to acknowledge excellent service. The waitress even appreciated it. The problem here is the date's reaction, not necessarily the action itself. The author didn't do anything harmful or disrespectful. The waitress was happy, the manager was grateful for the feedback, and the only issue was the date's personal reaction.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they didn't consider the date's perspective. But the act of giving a compliment is generally a positive thing. Unless there's a specific cultural or situational context where this is frowned upon, which isn't indicated here. The date's reaction might stem from personal insecurities or different expectations for the evening. The key point is that the author's action was in good faith and appropriate. The waitress's gratitude supports this.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is personal and not a reflection of the author's actions being inappropriate.\n"
