I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that the author and his date went to a burger place, the waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill, and the author wanted to commend her. The date, however, got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's action seems positive; he's trying to give feedback to the manager about excellent service. That's usually seen as a good thing. But his date was unhappy. Why? Maybe she felt that the compliment was unnecessary or that he was showing off. The author might have intended to be kind, but it backfired in the relationship context.\n\nI should consider social norms here. Telling a manager about good service is standard, even if the customer didn't want to tip them. But in the context of a date, the girl might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by complimenting someone else, which could come off as self-centered. The spill incident was handled well by the waitress, so the author's intention to acknowledge that makes sense, but maybe the date wanted him to focus on her instead of the server.\n\nThe girl's reaction is a bit harsh, but people have different expectations in dates. If the author was trying to be thoughtful by recognizing good service, but the date interpreted it as the opposite, there's a communication gap. The key is whether the action itself is wrong, not just the girl's reaction. Since the author did something positive (praising service), he's not wrong in the action. The conflict arises from differing expectations in the date, which isn't his fault. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
