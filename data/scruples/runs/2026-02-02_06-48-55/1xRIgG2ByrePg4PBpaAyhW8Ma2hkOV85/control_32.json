I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager. The situation is that the author went on a date, had good service, and decided to praise the waitress by talking to the manager. But his date was upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author thought the waitress did a great job, even after a minor spill that wasn't her fault. He wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave a positive review. The date was unimpressed and felt it was self-serving. Now the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Intent**: The author's intention was to compliment the waitress and recognize good service. That's generally a positive action. Praising employees through the manager is a common way to acknowledge their work, which can boost morale.\n\n2. **Context of the date**: They were on a third date, and the author was trying to impress the date. The date might have felt that this gesture was an attempt to show off or be self-centered. Maybe she was expecting a more personal gesture instead of a public compliment to a staff member.\n\n3. **Reaction of the waitress and manager**: Both the waitress and manager were happy with the feedback, so there's no indication that the action itself was unwelcome in a professional setting. The waitress even looked happy.\n\n4. **Communication issues**: The date's reaction might stem from her own expectations or insecurities. She might have misinterpreted the gesture or preferred a different way of expressing appreciation. The author's apology and willingness to reconcile suggest he didn't mean to offend her.\n\n5. **Social norms**: While complimenting service staff is usually appreciated, in a date setting, the partner might expect the praise to be directed at them or might feel that the action was unnecessary. It's possible that in the context of a romantic date, the focus should be on the partner, and any deviation could be seen as a misstep.\n\n6. **Possible overstepping?** Maybe the author didn't realize that the date had a different expectation. For example, maybe she wanted the night to be about their connection and didn't care for the public commendation. However, the author's action is still a positive one in a professional context.\n\nSo, the author's action was appropriate in terms of the waitress and manager, but it might have been a miscommunication or mismatch in expectations with his date. The key issue here is the date's reaction. The author didn't do anything wrong by praising the waitress, but the date felt it was inconsiderate. It's possible that the date was being overly sensitive, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. However, the author's intent was good, and the action itself is not inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for complimenting the waitress. The issue is more about the date's interpretation and what she expected from the date.\n"
