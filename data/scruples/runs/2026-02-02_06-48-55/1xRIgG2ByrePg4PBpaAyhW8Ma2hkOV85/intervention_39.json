I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for praising the waitress to her manager, which upset his date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to explain the situation. He and his date had a good time, the waitress was great, even when she accidentally spilled water but handled it well. He wanted to commend her, so he asked for the manager and gave a positive review. However, the date was unimpressed, called him an asshole, and now he's confused.\n\nThe user's take is that the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, complimenting the waitress is a nice gesture. It's common to give positive feedback to service staff, and it's a way to acknowledge good service. The manager appreciated it, and the waitress was happy. So maybe the author did nothing wrong in that aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the date might have felt that the attention given to the waitress was unnecessary or a form of showing off. Maybe she felt he was trying to impress her by pointing out the service, which he thought was a good thing, but she didn't see it that way. The issue here is about the date's reaction and whether the author's actions were appropriate in that social context.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? If he was just giving genuine praise, then ethically, he's not doing anything wrong. However, in terms of social dynamics between him and his date, maybe he misjudged the situation. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just a misstep in the relationship.\n\nThe key points are: Did his action directly affect the date negatively? He did something positive, which the waitress appreciated. The manager was grateful. The date took offense. But unless there's a rule against giving compliments to service staff in a dating context, the author's action isn't unethical. The problem is more interpersonal between him and the date rather than a right or wrong action.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He did something kind and appropriate. The date's reaction is a separate issue, possibly about their compatibility or how he handled the situation socially, but not his actions towards the waitress.\n"
