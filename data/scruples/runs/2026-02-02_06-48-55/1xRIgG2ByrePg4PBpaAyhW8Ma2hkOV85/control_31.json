I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author went on a third date with a girl he really liked. During dinner at a burger place, the waitress provided excellent service, even though she accidentally spilled a glass of water. The author decided to compliment the waitress by telling her manager. The date got upset, saying the author was full of himself and that the compliment didn't impress her. Now he's asking if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. He wanted to give the waitress feedback because he was happy with her service. That seems positive. Complimenting someone else's work is usually a good thing. But why did his date react negatively?\n\nThe girl called him an asshole and said it didn't impress her. Maybe she felt that he was trying to show off or that he was being self-centered by focusing on the waitress instead of their date. Alternatively, perhaps she was uncomfortable with the attention the waitress received or maybe she was jealous, though that might be a stretch. It's possible she felt the situation was awkward or that the compliment was unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to recognize good service. It's a common practice to give compliments to service staff through their managers. There's no indication that he was inappropriate or that the compliment was unwarranted. The waitress did a good job, and the manager appreciated the feedback.\n\nThe problem might be the context. They were on a date, and the focus was on their relationship. If the woman felt that the author was prioritizing the waitress's job performance over their time together, that could explain her reaction. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious. He was acknowledging someone else's hard work, which is typically a positive trait.\n\nAnother angle is social norms. Is it odd to give a compliment during a date? Maybe, but not necessarily wrong. Some people might find it surprising, but others would see it as thoughtful. It could depend on the expectations of the date. If the girl was hoping for a more intimate setting and felt the author brought in a third party (the manager), that might have disrupted the mood. But that's speculative.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's action was a compliment to a service staff member, which is a positive action. The date's reaction was negative, but there's no clear evidence the author did something wrong. It seems like a miscommunication or differing expectations. The author didn't do anything to harm the waitress, and his intention was to praise her. The girl's reaction is more about her personal feelings about the situation rather than the author having done something objectively wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The issue is more about the date's personal reaction rather than a wrongdoing by the author.\n"
