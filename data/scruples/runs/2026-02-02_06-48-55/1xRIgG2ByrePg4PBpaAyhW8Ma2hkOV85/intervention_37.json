I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress in front of his date. The situation is that he wanted to praise the waitress's service, so he told the manager and gave the compliment. His date didn't like it and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was trying to be kind and appreciate the waitress, which is generally a good thing. But why did the date react negatively? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to show off or that the compliment was unnecessary. Sometimes, people might feel that public praise is meant to impress others, but in this case, it was actually a genuine compliment to the waitress. However, the date might have felt overlooked or that the author was trying to draw attention to himself. \n\nAnother angle is the method he used. He asked for the manager to give the compliment, which might have seemed like a formal way to praise the waitress. But maybe she preferred a private compliment rather than a public one through management. Also, the act of going through the manager could have been seen as making a scene, though the author's intention was positive.\n\nThe waitress's reaction was happy, so she appreciated the feedback. The date's reaction was negative, leading to a rift. The key question is whether the author's action was inconsiderate towards his date's feelings. Even if the intention was good, the context of a date might require being more attuned to the partner's perspective. The date might have felt that the compliment was unnecessary or that it shifted focus away from their time together. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have thought it was a kind gesture, and maybe the date overreacted. But the user (the author) is seeking validation, and the question is whether he's at fault. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nConsidering social norms, praising someone's job is usually a good thing. However, in the context of a date, actions that might seem positive could be misinterpreted if they affect the partner. The author didn't do anything harmful to the waitress, but the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate to his date's feelings. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, since the date felt hurt, the author could be seen as inconsiderate, hence possibly in the wrong. But others might argue that he was just being kind and the date overreacted. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was inconsiderate in that specific situation. Since the date felt it was a problem, and the author's intention was to compliment the waitress, it's a mix. But since the waitress appreciated it, maybe the author wasn't wrong. However, the date's perspective is important in a relationship context. So perhaps A (wrong) because the action, although well-intentioned, didn't consider his partner's feelings, leading to the negative outcome. But others might say B (not wrong) because he was just being kind. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he got a negative reaction from his date and it caused a conflict, maybe A is more appropriate because the action, while good for the waitress, was inconsiderate in the date's context.\n"
