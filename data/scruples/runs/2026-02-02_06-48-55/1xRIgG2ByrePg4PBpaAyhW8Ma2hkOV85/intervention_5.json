I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her great service during a date. The situation is that the author, during a third date with a girl he really likes, took time to commend the waitress's service by speaking to the manager. The girl took offense, said he was full of himself, and ended the night without a kiss. Now the author is confused why this would be a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible perspectives. The author's intention was to praise the waitress, which seems positive. They mention the waitress did a great job, even after a minor spill. Complimenting service staff is a common way to appreciate good service, and it's generally seen as a good gesture. The manager and waitress were happy with the feedback, so that part seems positive.\n\nHowever, the date didn't go well from the girl's perspective. The key issue here is whether the action was inappropriate during a date. Maybe the girl felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off his ability to give compliments or by focusing on the waitress, which might have made her feel neglected or insecure. The author's action might have been well-meaning, but it could have been perceived as a misstep in terms of social dynamics during a romantic setting.\n\nAnother angle is that the author took time to speak to the manager when they could have been spending more time together. The girl might have felt that the attention was diverted away from their interaction. Even though the author's intention was to compliment the waitress, the timing and context of the date might have made it less appropriate. The girl's reaction suggests that she felt this gesture was more about the author trying to appear generous or impressive rather than focusing on her.\n\nI also need to consider social norms. Complimenting service staff is usually a good thing, but in a romantic setting, the partner might expect more attention to be focused on them. If the girl felt that the author was prioritizing the waitress's recognition over their date's experience, that could lead to hurt feelings. The author might have missed the social cue that the girl wanted more focus on their relationship rather than external compliments.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that acknowledging good service was a way to show appreciation and perhaps even impress the girl by being polite and generous. However, if the girl perceived it as trying to one-up or show off, the message could have been misread. The lack of response from the girl and her comment about being full of himself indicate that her feelings were hurt or that she felt slighted.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was likely positive, but the action might have been misinterpreted in the context of a date. While complimenting service staff is generally good, the situation's context could have made it problematic. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider their partner's feelings and the appropriateness of the action during a date. However, it's a nuanced situation where intentions were good, but execution led to a negative outcome.\n"
