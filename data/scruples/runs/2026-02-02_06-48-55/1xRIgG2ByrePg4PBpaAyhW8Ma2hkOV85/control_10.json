I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager that she did a great job during a date. The main conflict is that the date was upset by this action.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to compliment the waitress for excellent service. The waitress even appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. So, logically, it's a good thing to do. But the date took offense. Why? The user is confused because they see it as a kind gesture.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The girlfriend-to-be might have felt that the compliment was excessive or a way to impress her indirectly, maybe even feeling insecure about their relationship. Or perhaps she felt that the situation was being overcomplicated, or that the author was showing off by taking time to speak to the manager during their date. It's also possible that she was already feeling insecure and the gesture made her feel less special.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they were just being polite and acknowledging good service. There's no indication that the compliment was insincere. The waitress's reaction supports that. The manager was also thankful. The problem is the date's reaction, which is subjective. \n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong. Since the action was a positive one and there's no malice or wrongdoing in the author's actions, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings or misinterpretation. Unless there's a cultural context where this kind of action is inappropriate, which isn't indicated here. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have considered their date's feelings more. Telling someone that their date's manager about the waitress might have been a social faux pas in the context of the relationship. But the author's intention was genuine. The key is whether the action itself was wrong. Since it wasn't harmful and was a compliment, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
