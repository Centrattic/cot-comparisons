I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author complimented their waitress to her manager during a date, and their date got upset about it. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their date went to a burger place on their third date. The waitress provided good service, even when there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author then decided to commend the waitress to her manager. The date didn't appreciate it and called the author an asshole, leading to a breakup or at least a cold response.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for doing that? Let's think about possible angles. Complimenting someone in a service job is usually a positive action. Waitress probably appreciated the feedback, and the manager was grateful. The problem seems to be that the date didn't like it. Why would that be?\n\nMaybe the date felt that the author was trying to impress the manager or show off. The author mentions they were close to asking her to be their girlfriend. Perhaps the date felt neglected or that the author was giving attention to the waitress instead of her. Alternatively, maybe the date felt the situation was unnecessary\u2014like the author didn't need to go to the manager for a compliment. Some people might find that over the top or not appropriate in a casual setting. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? The act of giving praise is generally positive. However, in the context of a date, maybe the author didn't consider their date's feelings. The date could have felt that the attention was misplaced, especially if she wanted the focus to be on their relationship. The author's intention was to commend the waitress, but the effect was negative on the date. \n\nThe author's mistake could be not considering how their action would be perceived by their date. Even if the action itself is good, the context of a date might require more attention to the partner's feelings. Alternatively, the date's reaction is a personal issue, and the author isn't wrong for doing something kind. \n\nI need to weigh these possibilities. The key factors are the intention (to give a compliment) versus the impact (date was upset). The waitress and manager were happy, so the author's action was appropriate towards them. However, if the date felt overshadowed or that the attention was unnecessary, then the author might have been inconsiderate in that specific context.\n\nBut is that the author's fault? They might not have realized their date's perspective. Still, complimenting a waitress is a common gesture. Unless the date explicitly didn't want them to do that, which isn't mentioned, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The date's reaction is a personal preference, but the author's action isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
