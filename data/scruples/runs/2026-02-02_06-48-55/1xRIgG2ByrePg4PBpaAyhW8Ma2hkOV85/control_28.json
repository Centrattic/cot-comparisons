I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his date's manager that the waitress did a great job, and his date was upset about it. He's confused because he thought he was being nice, but she called him an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. They were on a date, and he wanted to compliment the waitress. He went to the manager to give positive feedback. The waitress had done a good job, even after spilling a glass but handling it well. The date didn't like that he did this and was upset.\n\nWhy would the date be upset? Maybe she's self-centered and doesn't like him spending attention on others, but that seems a bit harsh. Or maybe she found it unnecessary or felt it was an attempt to impress her. The author thought he was doing a good thing, but the date didn't appreciate it. \n\nThe key points here are the intent vs. the reaction. The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to commend the waitress. But the date took it the wrong way. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so. \n\nIs there any reason the author's action was inappropriate? On a date, maybe focusing on others isn't the best move, but giving a compliment is usually a good thing. Unless the date felt it was a ploy to show off or something. But the author didn't mention trying to impress her by doing that. He just wanted to give the waitress credit. \n\nThe waitress was appreciative, the manager was grateful. The problem seems to be the date's reaction. So the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress. Maybe the date had a low opinion of him or was insecure. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He acted appropriately in giving a compliment. The issue is the date's reaction, not his action. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
