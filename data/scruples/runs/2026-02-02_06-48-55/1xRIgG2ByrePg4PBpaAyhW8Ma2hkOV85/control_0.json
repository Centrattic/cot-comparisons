I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves complimenting a waitress to her manager, which led to conflict with their date.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to compliment the waitress because she provided excellent service, even after a minor spill that she handled well. They went through the waitress to get the manager and gave the positive feedback. The date took offense, thinking it was an attempt to impress her, and felt the author was being self-centered. The author is confused because they thought their action was positive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, complimenting the waitress was a kind and appropriate action. Praising good service is a common way to acknowledge someone's work. The author didn't do anything negative; they were trying to recognize the waitress's efforts. The manager appreciated the feedback, and the waitress was happy. So, the action itself seems positive.\n\nOn the other hand, the date's reaction suggests that she might have felt the author was trying to show off or gain favor by complimenting the waitress in front of management. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that the author was seeking validation. However, the author's intention was genuine, not to impress the date. The date's reaction seems more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the action itself being wrong.\n\nThe key here is the author's intent versus the date's interpretation. The author didn't do anything objectively wrong. The waitress received a well-deserved compliment, and the manager was grateful. The conflict arose from the date's personal reaction, not the author's action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
