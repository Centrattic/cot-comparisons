I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction. Hmm.\n\nThe author wanted to treat his date and noticed the waitress did a good job, even after a small spill. He went to the manager to commend her. The waitress was happy, the manager was grateful, but the date was upset. She thought it was an attempt to impress her and found it self-centered.\n\nSo, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the gesture was trying to show off or wasn't necessary in front of her. The author might have assumed that acknowledging good service is a positive thing, but the date saw it as the author taking credit or being smug.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, complimenting service staff is usually seen as polite and appreciated. In this case, the waitress was happy. But the context of a date might add pressure. The date might have expected a different kind of gesture, or maybe she was uncomfortable with the attention. The author didn't intend to upset her, but his action led to that. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was positive. He might not have considered his date's perspective. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first or chosen a different way to commend the waitress. But technically, the action itself wasn't wrong. The problem is the miscommunication between the two people on the date.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think it's more about perspective. The action is neutral, but in the context of the date, the girlfriend's reaction makes it a matter of differing expectations. The author didn't do anything objectively wrong, but he might not have considered how his date would perceive it. So, the answer would be B (No), but there's nuance here. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the situation is complex. Since the action taken was appropriate in itself, despite the negative reaction, the answer is B.\n"
