I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress through her manager. The main conflict seems to be the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good service. They did it in a positive way, right? The waitress had a minor spill but handled it well. Complimenting her through the manager is a common way to give feedback. But the girlfriend took it as the author trying to impress her, which backfired.\n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or the author was showing off. He mentions he was getting close to asking her out, so maybe she saw the compliment as a way to impress the author instead of showing genuine appreciation. That could lead to her feeling ignored or unimportant during the date.\n\nThe author's intention was to do something nice, but the girlfriend interpreted it negatively. The question is whether the author was wrong. Well, giving a compliment is generally a good thing. However, in the context of a date, maybe the author didn't consider how his actions might make his date feel. If the focus shifted from their interaction to praising the waitress, that could be seen as a mistake in social context.\n\nBut is that the author's fault? He didn't mean to make her feel unimportant. However, in relationships, actions have contexts. Maybe the timing or method of the compliment wasn't right. The waitress's job is to serve, so the author's gesture was appropriate. But if it made the date uncomfortable, there's a possible social misstep.\n\nThe key here is intent vs. impact. The author's intent was positive, but the impact on the date was negative. However, the date's reaction is subjective. The author isn't wrong for the compliment itself, but maybe for not considering the date's perspective. But is that his fault? Or is the date being overly sensitive?\n\nIn general, complimenting service staff is a good practice. The problem here is the girlfriend's response. The author might not be in the wrong for the action itself, but perhaps in how it was received. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the action itself is a positive one, the answer is likely B (No). The issue is more about the girlfriend's interpretation rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
