I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy wanted to compliment his date's waitress by telling her manager, but his date got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dynamics here. The man thought it was a nice gesture to acknowledge the good service, but his date didn't appreciate it. Why would she not like that? Maybe she felt he was trying to impress her by being helpful, but it came off as insincere or maybe she thought it was unnecessary. Or perhaps she was embarrassed if the waitress overheard or there was some personal reason.\n\nWait, the waitress didn't do anything wrong, in fact she did a good job. The spill was not her fault and she handled it well. So the author's action was a positive one. But his date took it the wrong way. Maybe the date thought that the author was trying to show off or that he was overstepping by involving the manager. Or maybe she didn't like that he was being so direct in front of the waitress and manager, making it a public thing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the date was just in a bad mood or had other issues. The author mentioned that they had a good conversation and he was close to asking her to be his girlfriend. Maybe the date had other expectations for the evening and this action disrupted her. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm being broken here? Complimenting someone's service is generally a good thing. However, doing it by involving the manager might be seen as excessive. Normally, people leave tips or a note, but going to the manager could make the employee feel like the customer is trying to get favor or show off. But the waitress was happy with the compliment, so maybe she appreciated it. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was wrong in the context of the date. If the date was supposed to be about their relationship and the guy focused on complimenting the waitress, maybe the date felt neglected or that he wasn't focusing on her. The date might have thought he was trying to impress her (the date) by being nice to the waitress, which could come off as trying to show he's a good person, but it might not have been the right time or place. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was positive. He wanted to acknowledge good service, which is a kind act. If the date didn't like it, maybe it's a communication issue between them rather than the author being wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to compliment the waitress. However, maybe he could have done it in a different way without involving the manager in front of the waitress. But the waitress was happy, so perhaps the issue is more about the date's reaction. The author's action itself was appropriate, so he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
