I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager his waitress did a great job. The situation is that the author went on a date with a girl he's interested in, and after dinner, he asked to speak to the manager to compliment the waitress. The girl was upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to praise the waitress for good service. But his date didn't appreciate it. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt he was showing off, trying to impress the manager, or maybe she was uncomfortable with him giving feedback in front of her. Alternatively, she might have thought the service wasn't that great, but that's unlikely since he described the waitress as enthusiastic and friendly.\n\nThe key here is the dynamic between the author and his date. Praising a waitress in front of a date could be seen as trying to show off wealth, being overly formal, or maybe the timing wasn't right. However, the action itself\u2014complimenting a service worker\u2014is generally a good thing. The author's intention was positive, but the date's reaction was negative. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the date felt uncomfortable or if the action was inappropriate for the date setting, then maybe the author didn't consider her perspective. But the act of giving a compliment isn't inherently wrong. It's possible the date had personal reasons for being upset that aren't tied to the action itself. The author might have misread the situation, but the action was good. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author didn't consider the date's feelings or if this was a cultural faux pas, then A could be the case. But typically, giving a compliment isn't wrong. The conflict is between their expectations, not the act itself. So I think the answer is B.\n"
