I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about complimenting the waitress through her manager, but the date got upset. \n\nFirst, the author wanted to praise the waitress for good service. That's a positive action. But the date didn't like it, thought it was self-centered. Maybe she felt the author was trying to impress her by showing off, or maybe she didn't like that he took the time to talk to the manager instead of focusing on her.\n\nThe author's intention was to commend the waitress, which is a good thing. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was thankful. But since it's a date, the focus should be on each other. Maybe the date expected the author to just pay the bill and leave, or thought that praising the waitress was unnecessary. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, there's no rule against complimenting a server. However, in the context of a date, maybe the author didn't consider his date's feelings. If the date felt overshadowed or that the praise was insincere, then the author might have misread the situation. But the author didn't do anything harmful to the waitress. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his date's perspective. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) since his action was positive but the date had personal issues. Hmm. It's tricky. The key is whether the action itself was wrong, regardless of the date's reaction. The action was good, but the context might have been mishandled. So maybe A, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe author's action was appropriate, but the problem was how the date perceived it. The author isn't in the wrong for complimenting the waitress, unless he did something inappropriate. Since he did the right thing, the problem is the date's reaction. So the answer might be B.\n"
