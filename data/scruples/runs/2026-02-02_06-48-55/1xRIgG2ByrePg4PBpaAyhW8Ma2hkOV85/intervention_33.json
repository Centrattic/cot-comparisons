I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about a guy who went out with a girl he met online, had a good time, and then at the end of dinner, he told the waitress's manager that she did a great job. The girl was upset and called him an asshole. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong and wants to know if others agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The waitress provided excellent service, even after a minor incident. The author wanted to commend her, which is usually a positive thing. But the girl in the story didn't take it well. Why would she be upset?\n\nMaybe the girl felt that the author was trying to impress her by praising someone else, which might have come off as unnecessary or even a bit arrogant. She might have expected a more personal gesture, like a date where he showed he was attentive to her, rather than praising a server. Alternatively, she could have felt that the author was being insincere or trying to use the compliment as a way to make himself look better in her eyes. \n\nAnother angle is that the girl might not have appreciated the public nature of the compliment. Even though he went through the manager, it's still a form of public recognition which can be embarrassing for the waitress if she's not comfortable with it. However, in this case, the waitress was happy about the compliment, so maybe that's not the issue.\n\nThe key point here is the girl's reaction. She said if that was supposed to impress her, it didn't. That suggests she felt the gesture was misguided. The author's intention was positive, but the outcome was negative. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his action was a reasonable way to express appreciation and if there were other factors he should have considered.\n\nOn one hand, complimenting a service worker is a kind and respectful action. On the other hand, if the girl was expecting a more personal or intimate gesture for their date, the author might not have aligned with her expectations. There's no right or wrong in terms of relationships, but it's possible the author didn't consider the girl's perspective in that moment. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the intention was genuine and the action was appropriate (since the waitress was happy), then maybe not. However, if the girl felt disrespected or that the gesture was insincere, then the author might not have been considerate enough of her feelings. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer hinges on whether the action itself was wrong or if it's just a difference in expectations between the two people.\n"
