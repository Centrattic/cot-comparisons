I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author went out on a date with a girl, and during dinner, they had good service from a waitress. The author then told the manager that the waitress did a great job. The date was upset by this action and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible reasons why the date was upset. The author's intention was to compliment the waitress by informing the manager, but maybe the date felt that this was unnecessary or even intrusive. The date might have been looking for more personal attention or a different way to show appreciation. Alternatively, she might have been uncomfortable with the author taking the time to commend the staff during what she thought was a more intimate moment between them.\n\nThe waitress's reaction was positive; she was happy with the compliment. The manager appreciated the feedback. So, the action itself was a good thing for the waitress. But the date's reaction was negative. The key here is whether the author's action was inappropriate in the context of the date. \n\nThe author might have thought that praising the waitress would show a positive trait, like being polite or recognizing good service. However, the date might have felt that the author's attention was directed away from her towards a staff member, which could be seen as inconsiderate. It's possible that the date wanted more personal interaction instead of the author taking time to speak with the manager.\n\nAnother angle is cultural norms. In some contexts, it's expected to tip and maybe acknowledge good service, but going out of the way to speak to the manager might be seen as overstepping. If the date was paying attention to how the author interacts with others, including staff, she might have had different expectations. \n\nAlso, the date's reaction could be influenced by other factors unrelated to the waitress. Maybe she was having a bad day, or there were other issues in their relationship. However, the user is asking specifically about the situation described, so I should focus on the action of complimenting the waitress.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, giving positive feedback to service staff is generally a good practice. However, the manner and timing might matter. If the date felt that the author's action was drawing unnecessary attention to themselves or the staff, it could be a point of contention. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the action was a positive one, but the date's reaction could stem from personal preferences or other unspoken issues. It's possible that the date was looking for a different kind of interaction or felt that the author's attention was misplaced during the date. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was appropriate in praising the waitress, but it's possible that the date's reaction was based on personal feelings or unmet expectations. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
