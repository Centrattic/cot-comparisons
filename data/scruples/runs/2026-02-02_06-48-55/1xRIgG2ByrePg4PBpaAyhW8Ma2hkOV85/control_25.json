I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl and they had dinner. The waitress provided good service, even though there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to the manager. The date didn't like that and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. Complimenting the waitress to the manager is a positive thing, right? It's a way to acknowledge good service. The author didn't report any issues; they were just trying to give feedback. The waitress was happy with the compliment, and the manager appreciated it. So from a service perspective, the author did something good.\n\nBut why did the date react negatively? The author thought it was a way to impress her, but she felt it was self-centered. Maybe she thought he was showing off or trying to gain favor through the waitress. Maybe she didn't like that he took the initiative to talk to the manager, making it a big deal. Or perhaps she felt it was unnecessary and drew attention to himself in a way that wasn't appropriate for a date.\n\nThe key here is understanding the context of the date. The author was trying to be nice and maybe wanted to set a good example or show that he's considerate. But from the date's perspective, maybe she found it awkward or thought it was overcompensating. It's possible she was sensitive about the waitress interaction, or maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her through third parties instead of focusing on their own conversation.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that says complimenting a waitress to a manager is inappropriate on a date? Not necessarily. But in the context of a date, the focus is usually on the two people there. If the author made a point of talking to the manager to give a compliment, maybe the date felt it was a distraction or that he was trying too hard to impress her indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, the date might have been feeling insecure or had some other reason to take offense. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the author's action itself doesn't seem inherently wrong. However, the reaction from the date is also valid because relationships involve mutual comfort. If the author's action led to discomfort, even if it's not the author's intention, there's a social aspect to consider.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for complimenting the waitress. It's a positive action. The date's reaction is her own issue, maybe stemming from personal feelings or misinterpretation. The author didn't do anything that was against social norms. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
