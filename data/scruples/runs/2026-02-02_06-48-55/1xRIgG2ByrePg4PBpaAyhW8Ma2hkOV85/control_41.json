I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went on a date to a burger place, their waitress was good, even though she had a minor spill. The author then tells the manager the waitress did a great job. The date was upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. Let me break down the details. The waitress had good service overall. The spill wasn't her fault because she was bumped into, and she handled it well. The author wanted to compliment her, so they spoke to the manager to give positive feedback. The date took offense, thinking the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress instead of doing it directly.\n\nIs there anything wrong with complimenting someone through the manager? Usually, when people want to commend a service employee, they might give the compliment directly or through management. The author's action could be seen as a nice gesture. However, maybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off or wasn't acknowledging her in the moment. But the author's intention was to praise the waitress, not to impress the date. \n\nThe date's reaction might be about feeling ignored or not being the focus. The author might have missed a chance to directly tell the waitress the compliment, but going through the manager is still valid. The key here is the date's interpretation of the action. The author's action isn't inherently wrong, but perhaps the date felt it was a misstep in their interaction. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
