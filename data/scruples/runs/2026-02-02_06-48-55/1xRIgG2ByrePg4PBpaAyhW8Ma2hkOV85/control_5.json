I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which caused his date to be upset. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author and his date went to a burger place. The waitress provided good service, even handling a minor spill gracefully. The author then told the manager that the waitress did an excellent job. The date took offense, thinking it was a move to impress her, and called him an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the context. The author's intention was to commend the waitress for her good service, which is a common and positive action. However, the date perceived this as the author trying to show off or be self-centered. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Publicly praising someone, especially in a professional setting, isn't inherently wrong. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager thanked him. The problem seems to stem from the date's reaction. If the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by grandstanding, that might be a matter of their personal dynamics rather than the author's action itself. \n\nThe author's action was appropriate in the context of the service provided. There's no indication that he did anything inappropriate or out of bounds. The date's reaction might be more about their relationship or her personal preferences rather than the act of complimenting the waitress. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for giving a genuine compliment. The issue lies more with the date's interpretation and their communication with each other.\n"
