I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, leading to a conflict with his date. I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's action: complimenting the waitress by speaking to the manager. That's a positive action, right? People usually appreciate when someone takes the time to commend good service. The waitress was happy, and the manager thanked him. So on the surface, it seems like a good thing. But his date took offense and called him an asshole. Why?\n\nThe date's reaction is key here. The author met her online, had several dates, and was close to proposing a relationship. The date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her with the compliment, but she took it as insincere or self-serving. Maybe she thought he was trying to show off by praising the waitress, implying he's the type to do such things to gain favor. Alternatively, she might have felt it was unnecessary or even inappropriate to bring up the manager for a compliment, thinking it could be awkward for the waitress or that it was a grand gesture to impress her.\n\nBut why would that make her upset? Maybe the author's approach was awkward. Instead of directly complimenting the waitress himself, he went through the manager. Perhaps she felt he was trying to be overly formal or that the gesture was a bit forced. Or maybe she was in a bad mood for another reason and used this as an excuse to end the date.\n\nThe spilled water incident might have been a red herring. The waitress handled it well, and the author still gave a positive review. The date might have misinterpreted the author's intent. The author's apology text suggests he didn't realize what he did wrong. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, complimenting good service is generally a good thing. If the author's intention was genuine, then he's not at fault. However, if the way he did it made his date uncomfortable, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But the problem here is the date's reaction. The author's action isn't inherently wrong. The date's offense might be about her own feelings or misinterpretation. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
