I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The main conflict here is between the author and his date, who was upset by this action.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to commend the waitress for her good service. They had a spill incident that was handled well, and the waitress was friendly and efficient. The author approached the manager not to complain but to praise her. That seems like a positive action. Typically, giving feedback, whether praise or criticism, is a common way to acknowledge good service. However, the author's date took offense, feeling that this was an attempt to impress her or show off, which didn't work as intended.\n\nThe key points to consider: \n1. **Intent**: The author's intent was to praise the waitress, which is usually a good thing. However, in the context of a date, actions can be interpreted differently. The date might have felt that the author was trying to be a \"do-gooder\" or seeking validation, which could come off as self-centered.\n2. **Context of the Relationship**: Since they are on a date and the author is close to proposing a relationship, the date might have expected more focus on her rather than a third party. The action might have been seen as inconsiderate of her feelings. \n3. **Reaction of the Date**: The date's response was negative, suggesting she felt disrespected or that the action was unnecessary. The author's apology and desire to continue the relationship indicate he's trying to make amends, but her lack of response is a red flag for their relationship, not necessarily his action towards the waitress.\n\nPossible interpretations: \n- The author is **not** in the wrong for complimenting the waitress. It's a standard practice and a kind gesture. His date's reaction is more about their interpersonal dynamics than his action itself.\n- Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong if the date felt neglected or if the praise was insincere, aiming to impress her instead of showing genuine appreciation.\n\nHowever, the story states that the author was genuinely impressed with the service and wanted to share the compliment. The date's issue seems to stem from her perception of the action rather than the action itself. Therefore, the fault might lie with the date's interpretation rather than the author's intent. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service, but the relationship aspect might have a different story. However, the question specifically is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Since the action was appropriate and the date's reaction is subjective, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
