I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his date are at a restaurant. The waitress does a good job, even when spilling water accidentally. He wants to compliment her, so he asks for the manager. He tells the manager that the waitress did an excellent job. The date doesn't like this, thinks he's full of himself, and they end up not kissing at the door. She didn't respond to his texts.\n\nHmm. So the key points here. The waitress's service was good. The man wanted to give her a compliment. Normally, you'd think that's a good thing. But the date didn't appreciate it. Why? Maybe because she felt he was trying to impress her by doing something nice for the staff, which she found arrogant. Or maybe she felt it was unnecessary or awkward. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he was trying to do something positive for the waitress. But the problem here is how it affected his date. If the date felt that he was trying to show off, maybe he did overstep. But is that the case? Is giving a compliment to a staff member in front of their manager a bad thing? It's a common way to give positive feedback. However, sometimes in dates, people might feel that the person is trying to impress them by doing such things. It could come off as the man being self-centered, thinking that he needs to do grand gestures.\n\nBut then again, complimenting someone's work is usually a good thing. Maybe the date had her own insecurities or expected a different kind of gesture. The man's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is a valid reason. But the woman felt it was unnecessary or even condescending. \n\nSo, is the man wrong? If his intention was genuine and there's no rule against complimenting a server, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his action was perceived as trying to impress his date in a way that she found arrogant, then perhaps he did make a mistake. Sometimes in relationships, even good actions can be misinterpreted. The question is whether he had a right to give the compliment, regardless of her reaction.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the way he did it was awkward. Instead of giving the compliment directly to the waitress, he went through the manager. But wait, the manager thanked him for the feedback, and the waitress was happy. So maybe that part was fine. The issue is the date's reaction. If she felt it was a ploy to impress her, then maybe he didn't consider her perspective. But the user's question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn my mind, the author might not be in the wrong because he was doing something positive. However, if the intention was to impress his date and it backfired, that's where the mistake could be. But the story says he didn't intend to impress her; he just wanted to give a compliment. However, in a date setting, actions can carry different meanings. If the date felt it was a showy gesture, then maybe the author didn't consider that context. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a grey area. But the core question is if the action itself was wrong, not the outcome. The action was giving a compliment, which is positive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the date's reaction, not the action itself. Hence, the answer would be B (No).\n"
