I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that they went on a date, the waitress did a good job, the author wanted to praise her, but his date didn't like it and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is trying to commend the waitress, which is a positive action. But his date reacted negatively. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary, or perhaps she thought he was trying to impress her in a way that wasn't genuine. The key here is the context of their relationship. Since they were on a third date and he was considering asking her to be his girlfriend, maybe she expected a different kind of attention from him, not focusing on the waitress. \n\nThe waitress had good service, even handling the water spill well. The author's intention to praise her is valid. However, the problem might be the method. Telling the manager in front of the waitress could be seen as public praise, but the waitress was present. Wait, the author asked to speak to the manager, then told the manager the waitress did a great job. The waitress was there, so maybe the date felt embarrassed or that it was a staged moment. Or perhaps she found it awkward. \n\nAnother angle: some people might feel that complimenting staff in front of management is a bit much, even if positive. Maybe she thought it was a way to show off or that he was trying to gain points by being overly polite. But that seems a bit harsh. The author's action is positive, but the date's reaction is negative. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being wrong: He didn't consider his date's feelings in the moment. Maybe she wanted him to focus on her instead. Or he made a scene. But the action itself is a compliment. Praise is usually appreciated, both by the waitress and the manager. \n\nArguments against: The author did nothing wrong. Complimenting service staff is a kind gesture. The date's reaction is her issue, not his. He wasn't trying to be negative, just positive. The waitress was happy with the feedback. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many places, it's common to informally compliment a server, but going to the manager might be seen as formal and unnecessary. However, the author didn't have a complaint; he wanted to give positive feedback through proper channels. Some might think that's a good idea. \n\nThe girl's response is the main issue here. The author's action led to a negative reaction from her, which is unexpected. But does that make him wrong? It's possible that their values clash. If she's put off by his desire to publicly praise someone, maybe that's a red flag for him, but he didn't do anything objectively wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action doesn't seem wrong. He was being kind and professional. The problem lies in the date's interpretation of his intent. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
