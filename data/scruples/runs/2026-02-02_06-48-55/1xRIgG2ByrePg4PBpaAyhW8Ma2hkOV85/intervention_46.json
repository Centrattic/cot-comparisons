I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author wanted to commend the waitress for good service, even after a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The date got upset, thinking the author was trying to impress her by putting on a show.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. Complimenting a server is generally a good thing. The waitress did a good job, and the author wanted to acknowledge that. However, the context here is a date. The author's intention might have been to show appreciation, but the date perceived it as an attempt to impress her, which backfired.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the act of complimenting the waitress isn't inherently wrong. But maybe the method was inappropriate for the date setting. Bringing the manager over in front of the date could have made it seem like a performance. The date might have felt that the author was more focused on showing off than on their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the waitress deserved the praise, and the author's action could be seen as kind and genuine. The problem might be more about the date's reaction and how the author handled the situation. However, the question is specifically about whether the author was in the wrong for the action itself.\n\nConsidering that the author's intent was positive (praising good service), but the execution might have been awkward in the context of a date, there's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of complimenting the waitress isn't objectively wrong. The date's negative reaction is more about their personal feelings rather than the action being objectively wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake, if any, is in how the date reacted or perhaps the timing, but the action itself was appropriate.\n"
