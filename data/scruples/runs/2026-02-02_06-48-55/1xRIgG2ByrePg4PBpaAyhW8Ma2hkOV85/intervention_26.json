I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job. The situation is that the author and their date went to a burger place, and the waitress provided excellent service, even handling a spill gracefully. The author then asked to speak to the manager to praise the waitress. The date was upset, thinking the author was trying to impress her, and it backfired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to commend the waitress. Publicly praising someone's work can be a nice gesture and might motivate the employee. But the date took it as the author trying to show off or be self-centered. The date's reaction suggests she felt the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress, which she found off-putting. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was trying to one-up her by showing he's a good customer or something.\n\nIn relationships, especially early on, actions can be misinterpreted. The author might have thought it was a kind gesture, but the date saw it as self-serving. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Generally, leaving positive feedback is encouraged for employees. However, in the context of a date, maybe doing it in front of the waitress and then the manager could be seen as trying to make a point. But the waitress appreciated it, so that's a good sign.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the date felt that the author was trying to take control of the situation or show off by getting involved with the manager. Alternatively, she might have felt that the author was trying to get favor from the staff to create a positive atmosphere that would impress her, but it came off as arrogant.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the action itself is positive. Praising service staff is good. However, the misstep could be in how it was done. If the date was more focused on the interaction between the author and the waitress/manager, and felt it was more about the author showing off than enjoying their time together, then maybe he did do something wrong. But if the author's intention was purely to commend the waitress, then it's not his fault. \n\nThe question is whether the author's action was inappropriate in the context of the date. Since the date is a personal setting, maybe public praise to management isn't necessary and could be seen as trying to gain favor or show off. However, some people might argue that it's just a kind thing to do and not the author's fault if the date misinterpreted it.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action was inappropriate in the dating context. If the author did it for the right reasons, then it's not their fault. But if the date felt it was a showy gesture, then maybe the author didn't consider her feelings. The waitress appreciated it, so maybe the author wasn't wrong. But the date's reaction is valid because communication in a date is more about the couple's interaction. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because complimenting service staff is a good deed. The date's reaction is about their personal dynamic, not the action itself. So answer B.\n"
