I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went on a date with a girl, and their waitress provided great service even after a minor mishap. The author wanted to compliment the waitress but thought it would be a good idea to go through the manager. The date didn't like it, called them an asshole, and now they're seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author's action was to compliment the waitress via the manager. The date found this objectionable. Why would that be a problem? Maybe the date felt it was unnecessary or self-serving, perhaps thinking the author was trying to show off their own generosity or attention to detail, which could come off as arrogant. Alternatively, maybe the date was uncomfortable with the public recognition, even if it was a compliment.\n\nOn the other hand, the waitress did a good job, and the author wanted to give her proper feedback through the correct channel. It's a common practice to compliment staff through management in some places. However, the date might have felt that this was an odd thing to do in a casual setting, especially during a third date where the author might be trying to impress. The date might have interpreted it as the author being overly formal or trying to use the compliment as a way to gain favor with the waitress, perhaps for personal benefit, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut the author's intention was genuine. They wanted to acknowledge good service, which is a positive action. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager thanked them. The problem is that the date didn't appreciate the gesture. So, the core issue is whether the method of giving the compliment was inappropriate in the context of a date. \n\nIn some relationships, people might expect that compliments to others during the date could be seen as a distraction from the focus on the partner. The date might have felt that the author was trying to impress someone else, even if it was just giving a compliment. It's possible that the date was sensitive to the attention given to the waitress, even though it was a service worker. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, complimenting good service is generally a positive thing. However, in the context of a date, maybe the approach was not considerate of the partner's feelings. It might have been more appropriate to mention the compliment to the waitress directly and maybe later tell the manager, or perhaps the date wanted the focus to be solely on them. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's action was inconsiderate. The author's intention was good, but the effect on the date was negative. The date felt it was a negative move, which could indicate that the manner in which it was done was problematic. However, the author didn't have any ill intentions. \n\nIn such situations, it's often about perspective. The author might not be in the wrong because they were just being polite and acknowledging good service. The date's reaction is subjective. But if the date felt it was a problem, then the author could have been more considerate. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intention was good and complimenting service is a positive act. However, depending on cultural or personal expectations, the method could be seen as inconsiderate. But unless there's a clear rule in dating that compliments to service staff should be avoided, it's hard to say the author is wrong. The date's reaction is valid, but the author's action isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
