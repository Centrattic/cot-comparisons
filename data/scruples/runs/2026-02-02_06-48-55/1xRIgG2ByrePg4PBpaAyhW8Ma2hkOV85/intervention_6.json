I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about complimenting a waitress's manager on her service during a date, and the date was upset by it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author met a girl online, they had a few dates, and on the third date, they went to a burger place. The waitress provided good service, including handling a spill gracefully. The author wanted to commend her, so he spoke to the manager and gave positive feedback. However, his date was upset, called him an asshole, and didn't respond to his follow-up message.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress in front of his date. The date's reaction is negative, but is her reaction justified? The author's intention was to praise good service, which is a common and positive thing to do. However, in the context of a date, maybe the date expected the author to focus on her rather than the waitress. The girl might have felt that the compliment was unnecessary or even inappropriate, perhaps feeling that the author was showing off or seeking validation through the waitress's reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything wrong by giving a compliment. It's a standard practice to appreciate good service. The manager would appreciate the feedback, and the waitress would be happy. The author's actions weren't harmful, but the girl's reaction might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding. The author might not have considered the girl's perspective, thinking that his gesture was a nice thing, but it could have been perceived differently. However, there's no indication that the author had any ulterior motive. He just wanted to commend the waitress, which is a good deed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he had no bad intentions and just wanted to do a kind thing, then he's not in the wrong. The girl's reaction is her own issue, not his fault. So the answer might be B, No. However, maybe the timing or the way he did it was inappropriate. For example, if the date was supposed to be about them and he focused on the waitress, that could be seen as rude. But in the story, the waitress's service was excellent, so complimenting her is reasonable. The manager is there for feedback. The author didn't make a scene, he just took the appropriate step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl felt that he was trying to impress her by showing off his ability to pay or his good judgment. But the author said he was treating her to dinner, so that's part of the date. The compliment was about the service, not about himself. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is the girl's reaction. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
