I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, and the date was upset about it. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, the situation is that the author and his date went to a burger place. The waitress had good service, even after spilling a glass of water but handling it well. The author wanted to compliment her manager, so he asked for the manager, and when the waitress came back, he told the manager how great the waitress was. His date was upset, called him an asshole, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if complimenting the waitress was inappropriate. The waitress did a good job, so giving positive feedback is usually a good thing. The spill wasn't her fault, and she handled it well. The author's action was to recognize her excellent service, which is a common practice. People often leave feedback, positive or negative, to businesses. So why was the date upset?\n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to impress the waitress or show off in front of her. But the author's intention was to commend the waitress, not to show off. Maybe the date misinterpreted the action, thinking it was unnecessary or that the author was trying to take credit or something. But the author's actions were straightforward: giving a compliment to the waitress through her manager. \n\nIs there any cultural or social norm that making a public compliment through a manager is inappropriate? Generally, no. It's a standard way to provide feedback. Unless there's a specific context where this might be awkward, but the story doesn't mention that. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. The only person upset was the date. \n\nSo, the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress or the manager. The problem seems to be between the author and his date. The date's reaction might be due to personal reasons\u2014maybe she felt overlooked, or perhaps she was in a bad mood. The author's action was appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. Did the author have to do it in front of the waitress? Maybe the date felt embarrassed or thought it was unnecessary. But the author's method was correct\u2014telling the manager, which is the proper channel. If the date was upset because she thought the author was trying to gain favor with the waitress, that's a personal issue, not a wrongdoing by the author. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. His action was positive and appropriate. The date's reaction is a separate issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
