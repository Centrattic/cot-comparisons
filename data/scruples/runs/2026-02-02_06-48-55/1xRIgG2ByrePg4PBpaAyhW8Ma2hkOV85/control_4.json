I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he praised his date's waitress by telling the manager, but his date got upset and called him an asshole. The main question is about whether his action was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author went on a date, they had a good time, the waitress was great, even after spilling a glass of water. He wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress a positive review. The date didn't like that and ended up upset.\n\nSo, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that he was trying to show off or take credit for something, but the author's intention was just to give praise. Alternatively, maybe she felt uncomfortable with the attention or thought the situation was awkward. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author and the perspective of his date. The author's action was positive\u2014recognizing good service. Typically, giving positive feedback to employees is encouraged. However, the date might have felt that this action was unnecessary or even a bit presumptuous. Perhaps she thought he was trying to impress her by being nice to the waitress, but that could come off as trying to appear generous in front of her, which might be perceived as self-serving.\n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress. He was being polite and appreciative. The problem is the reaction of his date, which is subjective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing something that's generally acceptable. Since the act itself was positive, the author isn't objectively wrong. However, the date's reaction might indicate a mismatch in expectations or communication between them. The author might need to consider how his actions affected his date's feelings, but the action itself isn't inherently wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer hinges on whether the action itself was inappropriate. Since praising service is good, the author isn't in the wrong. The conflict here is more about the date's personal feelings rather than a clear ethical breach. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
