I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, which led to his date being upset. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The couple went out on a date, had good service, and the author wanted to compliment the waitress. Instead of directly complimenting her, he asked to speak to the manager and then gave the compliment there. The date didn't appreciate it and thought it was self-centered.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, giving feedback to a manager is a common way to commend good service. But maybe the issue was the method. Complimenting someone directly is usually more personal and immediate. By going through the manager, the author might have seemed like he was trying to show off or not being genuine. The date might have felt that he was more concerned with impressing her indirectly rather than just expressing his appreciation openly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to acknowledge good service. The manager is a proper channel for such feedback, so it's not inherently wrong. However, in a romantic setting, actions that seem self-serving or overly calculated can be off-putting. The date might have interpreted the gesture as the author trying to impress her by showing he can give praise, which could come off as insincere or trying too hard.\n\nAnother angle is that the waitress was already happy with the direct compliment; the manager's role is to handle such feedback. But the author's action could have been a way to show off his own character traits, like being generous or helpful, which might not be the right approach in a date where the focus should be on each other.\n\nIn relationships, actions that seem to prioritize external validation or indirect methods can sometimes be seen as less authentic. The date might have preferred a more personal approach, like the author just complimenting the waitress directly in front of her. This way, the act is genuine and not a performance for the date's approval.\n\nSo, considering the context and the date's reaction, the author might have acted in a way that was intended to be positive but came off as self-centered. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of giving the compliment might have been inappropriate in the context of a date, leading to the date's discomfort.\n"
