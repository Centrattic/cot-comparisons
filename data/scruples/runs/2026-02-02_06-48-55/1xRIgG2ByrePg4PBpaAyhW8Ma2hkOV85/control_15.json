I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl and really liked her. They had a good time, and the waitress was excellent. The author wanted to compliment the waitress, so they asked to speak to the manager and told them about the great service. The girl was upset about this, thought the author was trying to impress her with the compliment, which backfired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. Complimenting the waitress and bringing in the manager to do so seems like a positive action. The waitress was doing a good job, and the author wanted to acknowledge that. Maybe they thought it would make the date go better by showing appreciation. But the date didn't take it well. She felt it was an attempt to impress her, maybe came off as insincere or trying too hard.\n\nBut wait, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the compliment was forced or that the author was trying to manipulate the situation. Or perhaps she thought the author was trying to show off, like they were in a position to give compliments. The author might have thought it was a nice gesture, but the girl interpreted it differently. \n\nThe waitress was happy, though. The manager was appreciative. The author's intention was positive. However, in the context of a date, actions can be misinterpreted. If the girl felt that the compliment was meant to impress her, maybe she wanted the author to be more focused on her instead. The act of bringing in the manager might have disrupted the date's flow or made her feel like the author was more interested in other people's opinions than in her.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author did it because they genuinely liked the service. They didn't do anything wrong towards the waitress. The problem is the reaction from the date. The question is whether the author did something wrong by doing a kind thing. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was inappropriate in the context of the relationship dynamics. The author's intention was to be kind, but the effect was negative. In such cases, sometimes the responsibility isn't entirely on the person who acted, especially if their intention was good. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like just complimenting the waitress directly instead of involving the manager, which might have been seen as more genuine and less performative. \n\nBut the problem isn't about the waitress's reaction but the date's. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't do anything malicious. However, if the date felt that the action was an attempt to impress her, the author might need to consider if their actions were appropriate for the date's preferences. \n\nIn some relationships, people prefer the date to focus on them rather than other things. The author might have misread the girl's expectations. But since the girl didn't explain her feelings until after the fact, and the author apologized, it's hard to say they were in the wrong. The action itself was good, but the context and the girl's sensitivity to it caused the conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Their action was positive, even if it had unintended consequences. The girl's reaction is more about her feelings and expectations rather than a wrongdoing by the author. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
