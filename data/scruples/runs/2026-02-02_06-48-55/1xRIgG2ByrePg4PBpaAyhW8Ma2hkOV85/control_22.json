I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, and they had dinner. The waitress was good, even though she spilled a glass of water but handled it well. The author wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and told the manager that the waitress did a great job. His date was upset about this and called him an asshole. Now, he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about why the date would be upset. Maybe she felt that he was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress in front of the manager, or maybe she thought it was unnecessary. The author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. But the date interpreted it negatively. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? Sometimes, people might feel that complimenting a server in that way could be seen as trying to get special treatment or maybe the date felt embarrassed. But in this case, the author was just giving a compliment, not asking for anything in return. The waitress did a good job, so it's reasonable to acknowledge that. \n\nThe date's reaction seems to be the key here. She might have felt that the situation was awkward or that he was showing off. But is that a valid reason for her to be upset? The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress; he was being polite. However, relationships often involve considering the other person's feelings. Maybe he didn't consider that his date might have preferred to handle the compliment themselves or might have felt uncomfortable with the public praise.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of giving a compliment is usually positive. The waitress appreciated it, the manager thanked him. The issue is between the author and his date. If the date is upset for no real reason, maybe she's being unreasonable. But if she felt that the situation was mishandled, like he was trying to one-up her or something, then maybe the author could have approached it differently. \n\nIs there any social norm that says you shouldn't give compliments to servers in front of managers? I don't think so. Usually, leaving feedback is appreciated. Unless there's a specific context where it's not appropriate, but the story doesn't mention that. The spill wasn't the waitress's fault, so the compliment was justified.\n\nSo the author's action was appropriate and polite. The problem is that his date didn't like it for personal reasons. The question is whether he was wrong in the situation. Since he did the right thing by the waitress and the manager, and the issue is with his date's reaction, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. The date's upset was her own reaction, not his fault.\n"
