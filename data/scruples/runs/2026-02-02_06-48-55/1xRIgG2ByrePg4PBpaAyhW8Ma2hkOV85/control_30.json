I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager during a date. The situation is that the couple went to dinner, the waitress did a great job, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so he spoke to the manager. The date was upset and called him an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was on a date and wanted to praise the waitress. Complimenting service staff is generally a positive thing. The waitress handled the spill well, so the author's intention was good. However, the date was upset. Why? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was showing off by going to the manager instead of just thanking the waitress directly.\n\nBut is the author at fault here? The action itself\u2014praising good service\u2014doesn't seem wrong. The manager was thanked, the waitress appreciated it. The problem might be in the method. Maybe the date felt it was over the top. However, the author's intention was genuine, so unless there's a cultural or personal norm that the author breached, it's not his fault. The date's reaction could be due to personal preferences or misinterpretations. The author apologized, so he's trying to resolve it. The waitress was happy, so the action had a positive impact. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
