I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to the manager.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their date went to a burger place. The waitress provided good service despite spilling water earlier. The author told the manager she did a great job. The date was upset, thought the author was trying to impress her and failed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether complimenting the waitress was wrong. The author's actions: they wanted to acknowledge good service. The date took offense. \n\nPossible angles: The author might be in the wrong if the date felt it was unnecessary or if it made the date uncomfortable. But the author's intention was positive. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. The date's reaction seems personal. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the date felt the author was trying to be grandiose, or maybe she had an issue with the waitress. But the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job. The author's action was a compliment, which is usually a good thing. \n\nThe date's response was harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment. The problem might be with the date's reaction, not the author's action. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
