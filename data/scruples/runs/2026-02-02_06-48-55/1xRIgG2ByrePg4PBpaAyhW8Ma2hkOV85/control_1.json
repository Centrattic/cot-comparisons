I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went on a date with a girl and they were at a burger place. Their waitress was really good, except she spilled a glass of water, but she apologized and fixed it. Then when he was leaving, he told the manager that the waitress did a great job. The girl took offense and called him an asshole for that.\n\nHmm. The girl's reaction seems a bit odd. Why would complimenting the waitress be an issue? Maybe she felt that he was trying to impress her by taking credit for the compliment, or maybe she was uncomfortable with him praising someone else in front of her. But the author's intention was just to give the waitress a compliment, right? He even said it wasn't a problem because she was quick to apologize when she spilled the water.\n\nThe girl might have thought that he was trying to show off, maybe she thought he was trying to make her look bad by pointing out the waitress's service. Or maybe she felt that he was being too direct in pointing out the good service, making it a big deal. But the waitress's manager was there, so maybe the girl felt that the author was putting the waitress on the spot, or that it was an unnecessary gesture.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's just trying to acknowledge good service. It's a common practice to tell a manager when someone does a good job. The waitress even looked happy. So why did the girl take offense? Maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship. The author was close to asking her to be his girlfriend, and maybe she was feeling insecure or had some issues with him interacting with the waitress. Like, maybe she felt he was too focused on the waitress or that the compliment was in poor taste. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spill incident made her sensitive, and the author bringing up the service might have reminded her of that. But he was praising the waitress despite the spill, which could be seen as fair. \n\nIs there a social norm here that the author broke? Complimenting someone's work is usually a good thing. Unless the person being complimented is in a position where it's expected to be humble, but that's not the case here. The manager was happy to receive the feedback. So the author's action seems appropriate. \n\nThe girl's reaction might indicate that she had other issues, but the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment. Unless there's a context where the couple was supposed to be the focus, and bringing in the manager was overstepping. But even then, it's a common practice in restaurants to give feedback. \n\nSo probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The girl's reaction is more about her own feelings or other issues in the relationship rather than the author's action being inappropriate.\n"
