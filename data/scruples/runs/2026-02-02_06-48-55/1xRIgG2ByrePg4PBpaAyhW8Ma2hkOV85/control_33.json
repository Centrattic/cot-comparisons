I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for complimenting their waitress's manager. The situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, had good service, and wanted to commend the waitress. They called the manager over to give a positive review, but the date was unimpressed and called them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the main action here is the author giving a compliment to the manager about the waitress. Normally, praising good service is a positive thing. The waitress did an excellent job, even handling a minor spill with professionalism. The author's intention was to give her due recognition, which is a kind gesture. \n\nBut the date didn't like it. She might have felt embarrassed or that the author was prioritizing the waitress over her. Maybe she wanted more attention or didn't expect the author to go through the manager instead of directly thanking the waitress. However, the waitress was there, so the author could have just told her directly. But the story says they wanted to talk to the manager to give the feedback properly, which is also a valid approach. \n\nAnother angle: the date might have misinterpreted the action as the author being self-centered, thinking he was trying to show off by getting the manager. But the author's text apology suggests they didn't intend to offend. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author's action was positive, but the reaction from the date is a personal issue. The waitress probably appreciated it, and the manager might have as well. The problem is with the date's perception, not the author's action per se. Unless there's a cultural norm against giving such feedback in a dating context, but that's not mentioned. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They did a good thing, and the date's reaction is on her. Unless the method of complimenting was awkward, but the process seems appropriate.\n"
