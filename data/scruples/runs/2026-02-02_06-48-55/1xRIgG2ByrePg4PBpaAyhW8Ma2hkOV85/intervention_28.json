I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went out on a date with a girl, they had a good time, and the waitress provided excellent service. The author then went to the manager to compliment the waitress. The date didn't appreciate this and called the author an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager. The date was upset by this action. The question is whether the author did something wrong by doing that.\n\nOn one hand, complimenting the waitress is a positive action. The author took the initiative to acknowledge good service, which is commendable. The waitress was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So, in terms of the service aspect, the author was doing something right.\n\nOn the other hand, the date was not happy. The author might have thought that this gesture was a way to impress the date by showing appreciation, but it backfired. The date might have felt that the author was being self-centered or that the gesture was unnecessary. Maybe the date wanted the evening to focus on them or felt that the author was being overly formal or trying to show off.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, complimenting someone at a restaurant is a common practice. Many people do this to recognize good service. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job. The date's reaction seems personal. Unless the author was trying to upstage the date or do something that would make the date uncomfortable, but the story doesn't indicate that. The author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action.\n\nThe date's dissatisfaction might be about unmet expectations. Perhaps the date wanted the evening to be more about them, or maybe they felt that the author was being too focused on other things. However, the author's action was appropriate. There's no rule against complimenting a waitress in front of a date. In fact, it's a considerate thing to do.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the date's reaction, not the action itself. The author did something kind and correct, and the date's response was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
