I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager that she did a great job, and the situation is that his date was upset by it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author went out with a girl on a third date, and they were having a good time. The waitress provided excellent service, even when there was a minor spill. The author wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager to praise her. The date reacted negatively, feeling that this was unnecessary or maybe even condescending, thinking the author was trying to impress her by being overly nice to the staff. The author is confused because he thought he was doing something good.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, praising the waitress is a positive action. It's commendable that he wanted to acknowledge her good service. It's a common practice to compliment staff, either directly or through management. The manager and waitress were happy, so the action itself seems appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the date's reaction suggests that maybe the way it was done didn't sit well with her. Perhaps she felt that the author was overstepping by going to the manager instead of just thanking the waitress directly. Maybe she felt it was a form of trying to show off or that it was unnecessary. Alternatively, she might have had a different expectation of how to handle such a compliment. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Probably not. The action of complimenting the waitress via the manager isn't inherently wrong. It's possible that the author's intentions were good, and the date's reaction was based on her own perspective or misunderstanding. However, the author could have considered his date's feelings by maybe complimenting the waitress directly in front of her, which might have been more personal and perhaps less awkward for his date. But since the waitress was happy with the feedback, and the manager appreciated it, the action itself doesn't seem to be the issue. The problem seems to be more about the date's personal reaction rather than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
