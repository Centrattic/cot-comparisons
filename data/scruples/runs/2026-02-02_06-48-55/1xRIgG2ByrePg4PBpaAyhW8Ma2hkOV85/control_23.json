I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager about her good service, even though his date didn't appreciate it.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to commend the waitress for excellent service, which included handling a minor spill professionally. He went to the manager to give positive feedback, which is a common and polite practice. The waitress was happy with the compliment, and the manager appreciated the feedback. \n\nNow, the issue arises from the date's reaction. She felt that the action was unnecessary or maybe even pretentious, leading her to call him an \"asshole.\" The key here is understanding the perspective of both parties. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service. Praising good service is a positive action. However, the date's discomfort might stem from different priorities. Perhaps she felt the situation was more about him seeking validation or showing off, which could make her uncomfortable, especially on a date. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he had no obligation to consider her feelings in that moment. But since they were on a date, maybe he should have thought about how his actions might affect her. However, the action itself is not inherently wrong. He was being considerate to the waitress. The problem seems to be a miscommunication or differing expectations between him and his date. \n\nThe date's response was to criticize him for something that's generally a good deed. Unless there's a specific context where such actions are a bad idea (like wanting privacy), the author isn't in the wrong. The waitress appreciated the feedback, and it's a typical way to acknowledge good service. The main conflict here is personal, not about right or wrong actions in a social norm sense. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His action was appropriate and positive. The date's reaction is her issue, not his fault. He did the right thing by praising the service and the waitress. The problem lies in their personal dynamic, not the action itself.\n"
