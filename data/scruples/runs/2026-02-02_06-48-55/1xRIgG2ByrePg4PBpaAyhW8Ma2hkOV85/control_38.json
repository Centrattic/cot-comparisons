I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went on a date, had good service from a waitress, and decided to tell the manager that the waitress did a great job. The date was upset about this, called them an asshole, and now they're asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different perspectives. The author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which is a good thing. Praising service staff is generally appreciated and can be a nice gesture. But the date didn't take it well. Why?\n\nMaybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off or be self-congratulatory by giving the compliment in front of the manager. Perhaps she thought the author was trying to impress her by being a good customer, but it came off as arrogant or unnecessary. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job; they were just recognizing good service. However, the way it was done might have been awkward or misinterpreted in the context of a date.\n\nThe key points are the intention vs. the perception. The author meant well, but their date perceived the action negatively. In relationships or dating, how actions are perceived is important. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their actions being objectively bad, but the date's reaction could be due to personal feelings or insecurities. The author should consider whether there was an underlying issue in their relationship that made the date react that way. But the act of complimenting the waitress is not inherently wrong. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's possible that the situation is more about a misunderstanding rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
