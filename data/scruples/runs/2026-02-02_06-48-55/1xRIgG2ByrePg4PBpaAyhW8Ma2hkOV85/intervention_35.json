I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress in front of her. The situation is that the author wanted to tell the manager how great the service was, but the date didn't like it. The author is confused because he thought he was being nice.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out if his action was inappropriate. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down.\n\nHe went out of his way to commend the waitress through the manager. That's a positive thing, right? Usually, giving feedback like that is good. But the date took offense. Why? Maybe she felt he was trying to show off or was too direct. Did he overstep? Like, maybe she didn't want him interacting with the waitress in front of her? Could there be jealousy? Or maybe she thought it was unnecessary. \n\nWait, the waitress did spill water but quickly fixed it. The author seemed to handle that well by giving praise. But did the date feel that the author was trying to impress her by showing he's a good tipper or someone who leaves positive reviews? Or maybe she felt that the author was being insincere, like trying to butter up the staff for something else? \n\nBut the author's intention was clear: he wanted to give the waitress credit. The manager appreciated the feedback. The waitress was happy. The only negative was the date's reaction. So is the author wrong for doing something right in front of her date? Or is the date overreacting?\n\nIn relationships, sometimes small things can cause big issues. If the date was expecting the author to focus on her during the dinner, maybe she felt he was more interested in praising someone else. Maybe she thought it was unnecessary or even a waste of time. But that's her perception. The author's action itself is neutral\u2014positive feedback. But in the context of a date, maybe he should have considered his date's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? The question is whether his action was wrong. From an objective standpoint, giving positive feedback is good. But from a relationship perspective, maybe he didn't consider his date's feelings. But he thought it was the right thing to do. The date's reaction is part of the situation. \n\nThe options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). The user says they think A but want opinions. I need to decide. The key points are: the action was positive, but the date disliked it. The author didn't do anything harmful to the waitress. The date's reaction is her own, but maybe the author should have discussed with her first. But is that necessary? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not wrong because he was just being polite and appreciative. The date's issue is with his actions, but he didn't do anything wrong in the situation. So the answer could be B. But maybe the author is wrong because he didn't consider how his date might feel. It's a bit subjective. \n\nI think the author's action is not wrong. He did something good and was complimenting the waitress properly. The problem is the date's reaction, not the author's. So answer B.\n"
