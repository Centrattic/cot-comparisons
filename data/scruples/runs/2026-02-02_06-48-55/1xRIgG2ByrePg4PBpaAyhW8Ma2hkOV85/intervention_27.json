I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service during a dinner date. The situation involves a third party, the waitress, and the person's date.\n\nFirst, the author's action: They told the manager the waitress did a great job. The date didn't like it, thought it was full of themselves, and ended the night on a bad note. The key here is understanding why the date was upset. The user's reasoning might be that complimenting the waitress in front of the manager was unnecessary or showed off. But is there a right or wrong in this context?\n\nThe waitress's service was excellent, including handling an accident gracefully. The author wanted to give feedback, which is a positive action. However, doing so in front of the date might have been misinterpreted. The date might have felt ignored or that the author was prioritizing the waitress's approval over their own. But the waitress's job is separate from the date; complimenting her is just acknowledging good service. \n\nIs it wrong to praise someone else in front of a partner? It depends on the context. If the partner felt overshadowed or that the praise was insincere to impress them, maybe. But in this case, the author's intention was genuine. The date's reaction seems to be about personal feelings rather than the action itself. The author didn't do anything unethical or harmful. The waitress was happy with the compliment, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So the issue is more about the date's perspective rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted appropriately by giving positive feedback. The problem lies in the date's reaction, not the act of complimenting the waitress. So the answer should be B.\n"
