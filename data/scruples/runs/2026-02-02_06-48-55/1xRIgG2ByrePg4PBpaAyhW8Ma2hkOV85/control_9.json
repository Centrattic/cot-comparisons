I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he went out on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. Their waitress was doing a good job, even when she accidentally spilled a glass of water but handled it well. At the end of the meal, the author told the manager that their waitress did an excellent job. His date got upset, said he was full of himself, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, the question is: was the author wrong for complimenting the waitress to the manager? Let's break it down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the action itself: complimenting someone's work. That's generally a positive thing. It's good to acknowledge good service. The waitress probably appreciated it, and the manager did too. So, on the surface, it seems like a good thing to do. \n\nBut the problem here is that his date didn't like it. She thought he was trying to impress her by doing that, and it backfired. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was showing off. The author mentions he was close to asking her to be his girlfriend, so maybe she was expecting a different kind of gesture or didn't appreciate him taking the initiative to compliment a server in front of the manager. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the act of giving a compliment isn't inherently wrong. However, in the context of a date, maybe he didn't consider how his date would perceive it. If she felt it was a way to show off or that he was trying too hard to impress, then maybe he misread her preferences. But is that his fault? \n\nHe had a good experience with the waitress and wanted to give proper feedback. It's a common practice to commend good service. The issue is more about communication between him and his date rather than the act itself. If he had asked her first if that would be okay, maybe, but he didn't know how she'd react. \n\nSo, was he in the wrong? It depends on whether the intention to compliment the waitress was inherently wrong, or if it's the date's reaction that's the issue. Since the act itself is positive, but the date didn't like it, maybe it's a matter of differing expectations. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for doing something good, but maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the options are A or B, not a nuanced answer. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author's action was positive, and the problem lies more with the date's interpretation than his intention. Unless there's a social norm against giving compliments to staff in front of management during a date, which I don't think exists. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
