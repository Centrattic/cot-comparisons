I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting his waitress's manager about her excellent service, which upset his date. The author is confused because his date called him an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to compliment the waitress. He approached the manager to give positive feedback. That's generally a good thing, right? People usually appreciate being recognized for good work. The waitress even seemed happy, and the manager thanked him. So on the surface, the author did something positive.\n\nBut his date was upset. She felt that this action was in bad taste. Why? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was showing off? The author intended to compliment the waitress, but his date might have seen it as trying to impress her, especially if they were on a date. Maybe she thought it was awkward or that he was overstepping by involving the manager. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions versus the impact. The author's intention was positive, but the impact on his date was negative. However, the date's reaction seems disproportionate if the action itself was harmless. But in relationships, how someone perceives a situation can be just as important as the action itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving a compliment is not inherently wrong. However, if the way he did it made his date uncomfortable, maybe he should consider the context. But the act of praising someone for good service isn't something that's typically considered wrong. The date's reaction might be more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the action itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. The action was positive, and the date's reaction is her own response. The author didn't do anything inherently wrong by giving a compliment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
