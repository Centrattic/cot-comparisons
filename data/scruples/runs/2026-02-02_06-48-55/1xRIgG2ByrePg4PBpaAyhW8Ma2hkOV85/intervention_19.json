I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a date, had good service from a waitress, and at the end told the manager that the waitress did a great job. The date got upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the author's action was praising the waitress to her manager. On the surface, that seems like a positive thing. But the date was unhappy. Why would that be?\n\nFirst, maybe the date felt that the author was trying to use the compliment to impress her, but it didn't work. The author's intention was to commend the waitress, but the date might have perceived it as trying to show off or not paying enough attention to her. The date might have wanted the author to focus on her instead of giving a compliment to the waitress. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the date didn't appreciate the author's gesture because she felt it was unnecessary or inconsiderate. Or perhaps she thought the author was being too formal or overcompensating. \n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. The author's action was a kind gesture towards the waitress, which is objectively positive. But the date's reaction was negative. However, the author's action might not have been the direct cause. Maybe there were other underlying issues in their relationship. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author did something good (praising the waitress) but the date was upset, does that mean the author was wrong? Or maybe the date is overreacting. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes actions that are positive in isolation can be misinterpreted. If the author had no intention of disrespecting the date and was simply being kind to the waitress, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. On the other hand, if the date felt neglected or that the author was trying to show off, the author might have been inconsiderate in the context of the date. \n\nBut the act of complimenting the waitress itself isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the timing or the perception. However, the author did it at the end of the meal, and the waitress was happy. The manager was appreciative. So maybe the date's reaction is the issue here. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The action was a positive one. The date's reaction is a separate issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
