Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The girlfriend is bisexual, and the author is heterosexual. He mentions that he's been asked if he's gay before because of his vibe, but he's straight and doesn't mind explaining it. However, the girlfriend's repeated questioning, especially after he's already told her he's straight, is frustrating him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's girlfriend got the idea from a friend after noticing his initial nervousness during sex. The fact that she searched his porn history is a big red flag. That's an invasion of privacy and not okay, regardless of her intentions. The author's frustration is understandable because he's having to constantly defend his sexuality when he's already stated it clearly.\n\nThe author argues that in 2019, he should be comfortable with his sexuality and not have to explain it repeatedly. He also points out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi and should understand the importance of respecting one's identity. The key points here are trust issues and mutual respect. The girlfriend's actions (questioning, searching through his history) might indicate a lack of trust, which can be damaging in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's concerns stem from insecurity or past experiences. However, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality after they've affirmed it isn't healthy. The author is within his right to feel upset about being disrespected and not trusted. The girlfriend's friend's involvement complicates things further, but the main issue is between the couple.\n\nI should also consider if the author's reaction is justified. He's not denying his sexuality; he's clear he's straight. The problem is the ongoing doubt from his partner. While it's important to communicate openly, the method here (privacy invasion and constant questioning) is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not his frustration. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
