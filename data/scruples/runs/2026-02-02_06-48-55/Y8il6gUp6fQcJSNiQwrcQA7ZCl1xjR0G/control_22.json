Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She's asked him multiple times if he's gay, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he's confident he's straight and doesn't understand why she's not taking his word for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or curiosity, but repeatedly questioning his sexuality without taking his answer seriously could be hurtful. The author is justified in feeling frustrated because trust is important in a relationship. If someone is not respecting the other's self-identified orientation without evidence or valid reason, that's an issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend also plays a role by suggesting he's gay based on his performance during sex. That's problematic because sexual performance can vary and doesn't define someone's orientation. The friend's input might be influencing her doubts unnecessarily.\n\nThe author's anger comes from being made to defend his sexuality, which should be self-evident once stated. It's 2019, and the user mentions that LGBTQ+ people have faced challenges, but he's not LGBTQ+ and feels like he's being forced to justify his identity. There's a hypocrisy here since the girlfriend is bi and should understand the importance of respecting one's self-defined identity.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any underlying issue the girlfriend might be dealing with. Maybe she has trust issues or is insecure about their relationship. But even so, the way she's handling it by questioning and invading privacy (checking porn history) is not healthy. The author has the right to be upset about being treated this way. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author isn't wrong for feeling frustrated and getting angry in response to her not respecting his sexuality. He's not being dismissive of her feelings, but he's standing up for his own. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
