Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She started questioning his sexuality after some initial nervousness during sex, and even checked his porn history to confirm he's not gay. He feels frustrated because he's had to defend his straightness multiple times, even though he's stated he's not gay. He's upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it and is making assumptions, which he finds hypocritical given her own bisexuality.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are: the woman's repeated questioning despite his clear statements, the fact that she shared his personal information with a friend, and the author's frustration over being made to defend his sexuality. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly even after telling her he's straight. This could be seen as a lack of trust and respect. Also, checking his porn history is a privacy invasion. The author might feel that his identity is being questioned unnecessarily, which is hurtful and not taken seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be acting out of insecurity or curiosity, especially if she's bisexual. However, repeatedly asking and invading privacy crosses a boundary. It's important to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The author has the right to his sexuality and expects his partner to believe him without needing proof.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The user might be considering whether the author's anger is justified. The situation involves trust issues and communication. If the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries or his self-identification, that's a problem. The author's frustration is valid because he's being forced to defend something he's already stated.\n\nIn terms of societal context, the author mentions it's 2019 and that he should be comfortable with his sexuality, implying that if he were gay, he would have come out by now. However, his frustration could also stem from feeling that his sexuality is being doubted despite his clear communication. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and resentment.\n\nI should also consider the power dynamics here. The girlfriend's actions (checking his porn history) are intrusive and could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to being treated with suspicion and not being trusted. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction is understandable. The girlfriend's behavior is invasive and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being mad. His feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n"
