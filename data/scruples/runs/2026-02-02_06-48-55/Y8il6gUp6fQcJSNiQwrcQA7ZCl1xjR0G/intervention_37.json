Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past. He doesn't mind answering but finds it frustrating that his girlfriend keeps questioning him. She got the idea he's gay after some initial nervousness during sex and shared this with a friend, who suggested he might be gay. The girlfriend has asked several times, even checked his porn history, and the author is annoyed because he feels he should be taken at face value.\n\nHe argues that in 2019, being in a relationship where one's sexuality is constantly questioned is outdated, especially since she's bi. He feels it's hypocritical that she doesn't believe him when he states he's straight, and he's frustrated with having to defend his sexuality.\n\nNow, considering all this, the key points are: the girlfriend's repeated questioning despite his clear statements, her actions (telling a friend, checking his history), and the author's frustration. The author's anger comes from feeling disrespected and not trusted. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be due to insecurity or misunderstanding, but repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality after they've been clear can be hurtful. The author has a right to feel upset if his boundaries are being crossed. However, he might also need to consider her perspective\u2014maybe her actions stem from her own insecurities or cultural factors. But since he's in a healthy relationship, mutual trust is important. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing his frustration, especially if the questioning is excessive. However, his response (getting mad) should be balanced with communication. The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's anger. Therefore, the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
