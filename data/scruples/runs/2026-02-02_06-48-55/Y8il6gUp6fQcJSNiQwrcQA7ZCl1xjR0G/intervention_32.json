Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that his girlfriend keeps asking if he's gay. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He mentions that he's been asked this before and doesn't mind, but now his girlfriend is questioning him repeatedly, even checking his porn history. He's upset because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and that she isn't taking him seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is heterosexual and has been clear about it. The girlfriend's behavior stems from her own curiosity or maybe insecurity. The key points here are trust and mutual respect in a relationship. If someone is in a committed relationship, they should generally trust their partner's self-identification unless there's a valid reason for concern. The girlfriend's repeated questioning, especially invading privacy by checking porn history, seems intrusive and potentially harmful. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being made to defend one's identity repeatedly can be exhausting. The situation might also reflect deeper issues, like the girlfriend's own biases or lack of trust. The fact that she's bisexual shouldn't mean she's more skeptical of others' orientations. Respecting each other's identities is crucial. The author isn't doing anything wrong by asserting his identity. The girlfriend's actions are the ones that might be problematic here.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). He's justified in feeling frustrated with her lack of trust and repeated questioning. However, it's also worth noting that communication is important. The author might need to address why she's so concerned\u2014maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship that needs to be discussed beyond just his sexuality.\n"
