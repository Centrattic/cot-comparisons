Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset with their girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author identifies as straight, and his girlfriend, who is bisexual, has asked multiple times if he's gay. The girlfriend even checked his porn history, which the author found frustrating. The author feels it's 2019 and if he were gay, he'd be comfortable saying so by now. He's frustrated that his statement of being straight isn't taken seriously, especially since his girlfriend is bi and should understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and feels his sexuality is being doubted. The girlfriend's behavior of checking his porn history is a big red flag. Privacy invasion like that is generally not acceptable in a healthy relationship. The fact that she's done this more than once and continues to question him suggests a lack of trust or respect. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from having to constantly defend his sexuality. It's important to note that being straight is a valid identity, and if someone states their sexuality, especially in a trusting relationship, repeated questioning can be hurtful. The girlfriend might have her own insecurities or misunderstandings, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is struggling with her own issues, like jealousy or insecurity, especially since she's bi. However, the way she's approaching it is problematic. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, and if she can't trust his self-identification, that's a deeper issue. \n\nThe author isn't being disrespectful or dismissive of her sexuality; he's just stating his own. The girlfriend's actions seem to disregard his boundaries. The fact that she's involved a friend in this (sharing personal details about the author) adds another layer of concern. \n\nIn terms of hypocrisy, the author points out that if someone in the LGBTQ+ community came out, they'd be taken seriously. His girlfriend being bi should mean she has that understanding. Her not taking his sexuality seriously could be a form of the same judgment she might dislike. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in being upset about the lack of trust and repeated questioning. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's reaction to them. The answer would be B.\n"
