Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual female. She keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. He gets annoyed and is upset that he has to defend his sexuality, especially since his girlfriend is bi, so he thinks she should understand and accept his identity without question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay because of his initial nervousness during sex. The girlfriend took that idea and kept questioning him, even checking his porn history. That's pretty invasive. The author feels it's frustrating because he's stated his sexuality clearly, yet she doesn't take it seriously.\n\nNow, the key points are consent and mutual respect in the relationship. If someone is in a relationship, they should respect each other's boundaries and identities unless there's a reason to question them. The fact that the girlfriend is questioning his sexuality repeatedly could indicate a lack of trust. Also, checking his porn history without consent is a breach of privacy, which is definitely a red flag.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's a straight man who doesn't mind being asked once, but multiple times and invasive actions are crossing a line. The fact that his girlfriend is bi should make her more accepting of others' sexual orientations. The author isn't being disrespectful here; he's expressing his legitimate annoyance at being doubted and having his privacy invaded.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a deeper issue. Could there be underlying insecurities or issues in the relationship? The girlfriend might have her own reasons for doubting him, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author has every right to be upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy violated. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while the question of sexuality can be sensitive, the girlfriend's approach is not healthy. Trust and respect are foundational in relationships. If the girlfriend can't respect his stated identity, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for feeling angry about being made to defend his sexuality when he's already communicated it clearly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. He's standing up for his boundaries, which is necessary in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
