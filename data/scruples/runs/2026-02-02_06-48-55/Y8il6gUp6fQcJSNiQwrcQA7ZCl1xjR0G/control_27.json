Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She's questioned his sexuality multiple times, even checking his porn history. He gets annoyed because he feels he should be taken at face value when he says he's straight. He's frustrated that his girlfriend isn't respecting his self-identification.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and respect in the relationship. If someone directly states their sexuality, others should generally respect that unless there's a valid reason to question it. The girlfriend's repeated questioning might stem from her own insecurities or lack of trust. The author is upset because he feels disrespected and not believed, which is a valid feeling. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend told a friend about the author's nervousness during sex, leading to the belief he might be gay. The friend then suggested checking his porn history. This part raises red flags about privacy invasion. The girlfriend shouldn't be discussing her partner's private matters without consent, especially if it leads to suspicion without evidence.\n\nThe author's frustration is about being forced to defend his sexuality repeatedly. While it's important to be open in relationships, one's self-identification is key. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as a lack of trust, which is a significant issue in any relationship. \n\nConsidering that the author is not in the LGBTQ+ community and doesn't face the same societal pressures to come out, his frustration is understandable. However, the girlfriend might have her reasons, perhaps past experiences or insecurities. But even if that's the case, the way she's approaching it (repeated questioning, checking private data) is problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's actions of invading privacy and not respecting his stated sexuality are wrong. The author getting mad is a reasonable reaction to being treated with a lack of trust. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but the girlfriend is. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions are questionable, the author's frustration is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
