Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times in the past, which he's okay with explaining. Now, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, has started doubting his sexuality again. She even checked his porn history and asked multiple times. The author is upset because he feels he needs to defend his straightness, and he's frustrated that his girlfriend doesn't take his word for it.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and respect in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions\u2014searching through his history and repeatedly questioning him\u2014could be seen as a lack of trust. On the other hand, the author is getting angry because he's being made to feel like he's not credible when he states his sexuality. \n\nThe author mentions that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. He also points out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi, implying that he thought she'd be more understanding. The fact that she's coming from a friend's suggestion might indicate she's not fully trusting her own partner's honesty.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual respect and trust are important. If one partner feels they have to constantly prove their sexuality, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's actions might be rooted in insecurity or curiosity, but the way she's handling it is problematic. The author getting frustrated is a natural reaction to being questioned repeatedly without being trusted. \n\nHowever, the author's anger might be valid because he's being forced to defend something he's already stated. The girlfriend could work on accepting his assurance and building trust instead of doubting him. The friend's role in spreading this doubt also contributes to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The main issue lies with the girlfriend not respecting his stated sexuality and invading his privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
