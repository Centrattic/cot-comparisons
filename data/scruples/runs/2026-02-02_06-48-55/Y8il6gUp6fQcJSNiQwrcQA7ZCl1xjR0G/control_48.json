Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked if he's gay before and doesn't mind answering, but now his girlfriend keeps bringing it up, even searching his porn history. He feels it's frustrating and hypocritical, especially since she's bi.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's frustration is valid. Being constantly questioned about one's sexuality can be annoying, especially when it's clear that the person isn't in the LGBTQ+ community. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have concerns about the relationship, possibly due to her own insecurities or past experiences. Her actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and a breach of trust. That's a red flag in any relationship.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being doubted. Everyone deserves to be believed when they state their identity. The girlfriend's behavior suggests a lack of trust and respect. The fact that she's bi doesn't excuse her actions. The situation highlights a communication issue. The author's anger is a reaction to being disrespected, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, the author should consider why his girlfriend keeps asking. Maybe there's underlying insecurity or fear. Instead of just getting mad, addressing the root cause through communication might help. But the girlfriend's actions, like searching his phone, are definitely wrong. The author isn't at fault for being angry about that violation of privacy.\n\nSo, overall, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). His frustration is justified given the repeated questioning and invasion of privacy. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's reaction.\n"
