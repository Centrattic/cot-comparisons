Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, but he doesn't mind telling people he's straight. However, his girlfriend keeps bringing it up, even after he's confirmed he's not gay. She even told a friend who suggested he might be gay, leading to more questions. The author is frustrated because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality, which he finds unnecessary, especially since he's comfortable with it. He's upset because he thinks it's hypocritical of her to question him when she's bi.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust and respect are key in a relationship. If someone consistently questions their partner's identity after being told directly, that's a red flag. The author has the right to feel that his sexuality is being doubted without valid reason. However, maybe there's some underlying issue. The girlfriend might be insecure or have her own issues with bisexuality, leading her to question his orientation. But even so, repeatedly bringing it up and invading privacy (like checking his porn history) is not healthy. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. It's 2019 (though the question is a bit outdated now, but the context is from that time), and he feels like he should be accepted without having to prove himself. The girlfriend's actions could be signs of insecurity or lack of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset by the repeated questioning and lack of trust. The girlfriend might need to work on her own insecurities and trust issues. \n\nSo the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's frustration with being questioned without cause.\n"
