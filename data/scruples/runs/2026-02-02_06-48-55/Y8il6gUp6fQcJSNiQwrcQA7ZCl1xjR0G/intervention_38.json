Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a heterosexual man who's frustrated that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The girlfriend is bisexual, and she initially thought he might be gay because he had some nervousness during sex and shared that with her friend. She's since asked multiple times and even checked his porn history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is comfortable being straight and doesn't mind when others question it, but in this case, his girlfriend isn't taking his assertions seriously. He feels it's frustrating and hypocritical, especially since she's bi. The girlfriend's actions include repeated questioning and invading his privacy by checking his porn history. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and respect are important. If the girlfriend is not respecting his stated sexuality and invading his privacy, that's a problem. The author's frustration is understandable. However, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or reasons for her behavior. But the key issue here is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe author isn't the one questioning the relationship or being invasive. He's expressing his feelings of being unfairly judged. The girlfriend's actions suggest she might have trust issues or personal anxieties. The author isn't wrong for being upset when someone doesn't take his identity seriously, especially when it's affecting their relationship dynamics. \n\nI should also consider the broader context of LGBTQ+ experiences. The author mentions that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable now, but that's a generalization. People come out at different times. However, in this case, the author is asserting his straightness and feels the need to defend it. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and privacy invasion are problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for being frustrated. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
