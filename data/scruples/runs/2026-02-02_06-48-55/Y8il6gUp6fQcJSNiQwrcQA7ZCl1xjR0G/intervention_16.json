Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is straight and his girlfriend is bisexual. The girlfriend started questioning his sexuality after they began dating. The author mentions that he gave off a vibe of being gay, which others have asked before, but he's okay with explaining. The girlfriend told her friend about his nervousness during sex, leading her to think he might be gay. He told her he's straight, but she keeps asking again. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and is upset that his answer isn't taken seriously.\n\nThe author feels it's 2019, so if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. He thinks it's hypocritical because his girlfriend is bi, so she should understand. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at his girlfriend and her friend's skepticism.\n\nHmm. The girlfriend's behavior of asking repeatedly and checking his porn history could be an issue. Trust is important in a relationship. If the girlfriend isn't respecting his answer, that's a problem. The author's frustration seems valid. However, the author's assumption that if he were gay he'd be comfortable by 2019 might be a bit dismissive. People come out at different times and for different reasons, even in more accepting times. But in this case, the author has stated he's straight, so the repeated questioning could be seen as not respecting his autonomy.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being mad? The girlfriend's actions are likely the main issue here. The author is reacting to her not taking his word at face value. The author's anger might be justified because of her lack of trust. However, if the author's initial reaction was to get annoyed instead of addressing the underlying issues in communication, maybe there's a way to handle it better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Given that the girlfriend is not respecting his stated sexuality and is intruding on his privacy (checking porn history), the author's frustration is understandable. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
