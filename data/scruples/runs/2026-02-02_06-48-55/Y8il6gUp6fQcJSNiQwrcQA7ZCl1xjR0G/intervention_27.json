Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who's dating a bisexual girlfriend. She keeps asking him if he's gay, even after he's told her he's straight. The author is frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality and is upset that his girlfriend and her friend don't take his answer seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is heterosexual and feels his identity is being questioned repeatedly. He mentions that others have asked him before, but here it's his girlfriend, which is more personal. The girlfriend might be doubting his commitment or fidelity because of his nervousness during sex. But the author is upset because he feels he should be believed without question.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the girlfriend is questioning his sexuality multiple times and even checking his porn history, that's a breach of trust. It's invasive and shows a lack of faith in her partner. The author's frustration is valid because no one should have to constantly justify their orientation, especially in a trusting relationship. However, the girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or past experiences that make her question this.\n\nThe author's argument is that in 2019, being openly gay is more accepted, so he should be comfortable and trusted. However, the girlfriend's actions suggest she doesn't trust his self-identification. The key issue here is the lack of trust from her side. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about being doubted. The girlfriend's actions are more problematic because trust is a two-way street. The author is within his rights to feel frustrated and express that he's tired of defending his sexuality. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
