Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a heterosexual man dating a bisexual woman. His girlfriend has asked him multiple times if he's gay, including checking his porn history. The author feels it's frustrating and hypocritical, especially since he's with a bi partner. He's getting annoyed because he's not being taken seriously when he states he's straight.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's frustration is valid. People should be able to self-identify their sexuality without constant doubt. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, could be seen as invasive and not trusting. But maybe there's an underlying issue. Why is she so fixated on this? Could there be insecurity or past experiences making her question his commitment? However, regardless of her reasons, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality after they've stated it can be hurtful and unnecessary. Trust is a two-way street in a relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being mistrusted. It's one thing to have concerns, but it's another to not respect his self-identification. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
