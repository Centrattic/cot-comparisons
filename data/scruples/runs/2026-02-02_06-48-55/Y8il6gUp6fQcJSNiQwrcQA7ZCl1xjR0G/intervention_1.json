Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She's asked him several times if he's gay, and he's told her he's straight. She even checked his porn history to confirm. The author feels frustrated because he doesn't mind being asked once, but being questioned multiple times and not being taken seriously is making him upset. He's also annoyed that his girlfriend isn't respecting his self-identification.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's a heterosexual man who's being doubted about his sexuality. He's expressed his orientation clearly, yet she continues to question him. It's valid for him to feel defensive or frustrated if his identity is repeatedly challenged. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friend might have planted the idea based on his sexual performance, which is a different context. However, the girlfriend's actions of checking his history and repeated questioning could be seen as invasive and distrustful.\n\nThe key points here are trust and mutual respect in a relationship. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or lack of trust, but that doesn't justify the author having to defend his sexuality over and over. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he feels his declarations aren't respected. The girlfriend's actions could be harmful to the relationship's trust and emotional well-being.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns? If she's bisexual, perhaps she's insecure about his attraction to women, but that's speculative. The author's main issue is being made to feel like he's not taken seriously when he states his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions (checking his history) are a privacy violation, which is a problem regardless of the reason. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The answer would hinge on whether his reaction is justified. Since the girlfriend's behavior is problematic (repeated questioning, invasion of privacy), the author's frustration is a reasonable response. He's not the one who violated trust or disrespected his identity. So the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend's actions are the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
