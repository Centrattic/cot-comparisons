Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a heterosexual man who's upset because his bisexual girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. The author is frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, and he's annoyed that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being asked repeatedly if he's gay, which he finds annoying. He's straight, and he doesn't mind explaining it, but the constant questioning is bothering him. The girlfriend's side is that she initially had a reason (he was nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing) and a friend told her to consider that he might be gay. She then checked his porn history and keeps asking, maybe out of concern or not trusting him. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics of the relationship. Trust is a big factor here. If the girlfriend isn't respecting his sexuality after he's told her, that could be a problem. On the other hand, if he was actually straight, why was he nervous during sex? That might be something to explore, but it doesn't mean he's lying about his sexuality. Maybe it's anxiety or other factors. \n\nThe author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, which is valid. It's 2019, and while societal attitudes have improved, there's still misunderstanding. The girlfriend's actions\u2014asking repeatedly and checking his porn history\u2014could be seen as invasive and not trusting. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction is getting mad. While his frustration is understandable, the way he's responding might not be the healthiest. He's being defensive and possibly dismissive of her concerns. The girlfriend might have valid reasons for her questions, even if they're not well-founded. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of getting angry, the author might need to address why she's questioning his sexuality repeatedly. Maybe there's underlying insecurity or a lack of trust that needs to be resolved. However, the girlfriend shouldn't keep questioning his sexuality after he's provided answers. Trust should be foundational. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but the way he's reacting could be an issue. The girlfriend's actions are also problematic because of the lack of trust. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's justified in being frustrated, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, his reaction might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the answer options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering the situation, the girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasion of privacy (checking his porn history) are definitely wrong. The author's anger might be valid in response to that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
