Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset that their girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The situation involves the girlfriend suspecting he's gay due to initial sexual performance issues and a friend suggesting it. The author feels frustrated because he's repeatedly asked and even had his porn history checked. He argues that if he were gay, he'd have come out by now, and he's tired of justifying his straightness.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is a heterosexual man who doesn't mind being asked once or twice but finds it offensive that it's happening multiple times. His girlfriend, being bisexual, might have different experiences with trust issues, but her actions seem intrusive. The author's frustration is valid because being questioned repeatedly about one's sexuality can be hurtful, especially when it's not a concern for the person being asked.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her reasons. If her friend suggested it, maybe she's genuinely worried something's wrong. But her actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and disrespectful. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and her behavior could erode that. The author's reaction to being annoyed is understandable given the invasion of privacy and lack of trust.\n\nAlso, considering the context of 2019, societal attitudes are more accepting, so the author's frustration about needing to defend his sexuality is valid. The girlfriend's friend not accepting his answer isn't helping either. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being treated with distrust and having his privacy violated. The key points here are trust, respect, and communication. The author isn't the one at fault; the girlfriend's actions are the issue. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
