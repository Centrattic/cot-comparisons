Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, but now she's doing it again and even checked his porn history. The author feels frustrated because he's not being taken seriously when he says he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: the girlfriend is questioning the author's sexuality multiple times, even after he's stated he's straight. The author feels it's unnecessary and offensive, especially after she checked his porn history. He's upset because he believes if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. The girlfriend might be worried about something else, but the author feels this is leading to distrust.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of trust in a relationship. If someone is checking the other's phone or porn history without consent, that's a breach of trust. The girlfriend's actions here could be seen as invasive and not respecting his privacy. The author's frustration is valid because he's being asked to justify his sexuality repeatedly, which can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend's role in suggesting the author might be gay isn't mentioned as much, but the main issue is with the girlfriend's repeated questioning. The author's anger comes from feeling disrespected and not trusted. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the girlfriend's actions are the primary issue here. She's not respecting his boundaries by checking his history and persistently questioning his sexuality. The author's reaction is a response to her actions. So, the author isn't wrong for being upset. The problem lies with the girlfriend's behavior. \n\nHowever, relationships require open communication. If the author wants to address this, he should express his feelings calmly and ask why she's doubting him. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is the one initiating the mistrustful actions, the author isn't at fault for being angry. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
