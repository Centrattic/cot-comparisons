Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in his life, which he's okay with. Now, his girlfriend has started questioning his sexuality again, even going as far as checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he should be taken at face value when he says he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might be concerned because of the initial issues during sex. Maybe she's worried about his comfort level or if there's something else going on. However, repeatedly questioning his sexuality and invading his privacy by checking his porn history is definitely overstepping. That kind of behavior can be seen as distrustful and disrespectful, which is a problem in any relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. It's important to feel trusted and not have to defend one's identity repeatedly. The fact that his girlfriend is bi and should be more accepting adds another layer. The user is in a position where he's being asked to justify his sexuality, which is not something he should have to do. It's 2019, and the user is in a place where he's comfortable being straight, so the girlfriend's continued doubt is problematic.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. Maybe the girlfriend has her reasons for her concerns, but the way she's addressing them is harmful. The user's anger is a reaction to being disrespected and not being trusted. So, the question is, is the user in the wrong for being angry? Or is the girlfriend's behavior the main issue here?\n\nThe user isn't wrong for feeling upset. The girlfriend's actions are the root cause of the conflict. The user is justified in being frustrated with the lack of trust and privacy invasion. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
