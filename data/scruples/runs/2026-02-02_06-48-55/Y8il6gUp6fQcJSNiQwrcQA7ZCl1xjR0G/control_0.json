Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad that his girlfriend keeps asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times, which he doesn't mind, but now his girlfriend is repeatedly questioning him. She got the idea from a friend after noticing he was nervous during sex initially and even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he's told her he's straight, and he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, which he finds hypocritical given she's bi and it's 2019.\n\nHmm. So, the author's main issue is that he's being made to justify his identity repeatedly, which can be annoying and disrespectful. On the other hand, his girlfriend might have her reasons\u2014maybe her friend's comment planted a seed, or she's insecure. But the author is clear he's straight, so if she doesn't take that at face value, that's problematic. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's upset because he's not being believed when he states his sexuality. That's valid. Everyone should be able to state their identity without constant questioning. His frustration is understandable. However, maybe there's an element of trust here. If he's in a committed relationship, does his partner have a right to be curious about his past behaviors, like porn history? But invading privacy like checking his history without permission is definitely on her. \n\nThe author isn't being confrontational, just expressing annoyance at the repeated questioning. It's 2019, so societal norms have evolved, and assuming someone's sexuality despite their clear statement isn't ideal. The girlfriend's friend might also be contributing to the issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's within his rights to be upset about being doubted when he's stated his orientation. The onus is on the girlfriend to trust him, especially since he's not causing any harm by being straight. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
