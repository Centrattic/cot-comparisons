Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually doesn't mind. Now, after a few months of dating, she's brought it up multiple times, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he's stated he's straight, but she doesn't seem to take it seriously.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he feels his sexuality is being doubted, which is unfair. He mentions that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. He's also pointing out hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi and he feels like LGBTQ+ people have faced challenges coming out, but now he's the one being questioned without being taken seriously.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend also got involved, suggesting he might be gay, and the girlfriend checked his porn history. That's a privacy issue. The author is getting annoyed because he's been clear about his orientation, yet the questions persist. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, getting upset when someone repeatedly questions your identity, especially after you've already stated it, isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's actions (consulting a friend, searching through private info) might be the real issue here. The author isn't at fault for being frustrated. The problem lies with the girlfriend not respecting his stated identity and overstepping boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
