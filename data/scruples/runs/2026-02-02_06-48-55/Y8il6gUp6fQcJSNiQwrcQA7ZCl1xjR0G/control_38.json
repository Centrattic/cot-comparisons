Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and the girlfriend is bi. The girlfriend started questioning him after some initial sexual issues, and even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels like he's being made to defend his sexuality despite stating he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has the right to feel frustrated if his self-identification is being doubted. If someone is open about their orientation and still faces skepticism, that can be hurtful and unnecessary. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for questioning, maybe insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify repeatedly doubting his identity.\n\nThe key points are respect for self-identified sexuality and mutual trust in a relationship. If the girlfriend isn't respecting his statement, that's an issue. The fact that she shared personal details with a friend and then used that to question him might indicate a lack of trust. The author's reaction is about being taken at his word, which is valid. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as intrusive and disrespectful. Since the author is clear about his orientation and the girlfriend isn't accepting it, the problem lies with her, not him. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for being upset.\n"
