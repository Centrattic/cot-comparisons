Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The situation involves the author being a heterosexual male dating a bisexual woman. He's had this question come up before, but usually just tells people he's straight. However, his girlfriend is persistently doubting his sexuality, even checking his porn history, which he finds frustrating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and is being questioned about his sexuality, which he's already stated multiple times. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or curiosity, but it's important to look at how he's been treated. The fact that she told a friend, who then suggested he might be gay, and then continues to question despite his answers, shows a pattern of not respecting his self-identification.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because being asked repeatedly to prove his sexuality can be dehumanizing and disrespectful. It's similar to how LGBTQ+ individuals sometimes feel when their identity is doubted, so the author is drawing a parallel here. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they see the girlfriend's actions as a valid concern given her bisexuality. But bisexuality doesn't mean she can't be in a monogamous relationship with a man. Her questioning his orientation repeatedly might indicate a deeper issue, like lack of trust or her own biases.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend searching through his porn history is an invasion of privacy, which is a red flag. That action alone could be seen as disrespectful and overstepping boundaries. The author's anger in response to that and the repeated questions is a reaction to being disrespected. The argument that it's 2019 and he should be comfortable with his sexuality if he were gay might be his way of saying that it's not fair to keep doubting him when he's already given a straightforward answer.\n\nSo, the key points are: repeated questioning despite clear answers, invasion of privacy, and the author's right to his self-identified sexuality. The girlfriend's actions seem to be the issue here, not the author's being upset. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated with her not taking his word seriously. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
