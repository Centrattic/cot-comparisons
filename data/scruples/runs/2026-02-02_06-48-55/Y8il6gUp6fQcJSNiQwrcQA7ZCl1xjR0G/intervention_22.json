Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually accepts it when he says he's straight. Now, his girlfriend has been questioning his sexuality again, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he doesn't have to defend his sexuality, especially since he's in a committed relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's frustration is valid because no one should have to constantly prove their sexuality in a relationship. If he's in a committed relationship, trust is essential. However, the girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or past experiences. Maybe she's worried about his commitment or her own insecurities as a bisexual person. Her actions, like checking his porn history, are definitely a privacy violation and untrustworthy. But the author's anger at being questioned might come from feeling mistrusted or disrespected.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's allowed to be comfortable with his identity and that his girlfriend isn't taking him seriously. On the flip side, the girlfriend might feel the need to ask if she has reasons to doubt. But since there's no indication of him acting in ways that would cause those doubts (other than initial sex performance issues which he's resolved), her continued questioning seems unwarranted. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being mistrusted. However, the girlfriend's behavior is the root issue. The author's response\u2014getting mad\u2014is a reaction to her actions, which are problematic. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's reacting to his girlfriend's lack of trust, but maybe he could handle it with more communication. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for getting mad. Since his feelings are valid, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
