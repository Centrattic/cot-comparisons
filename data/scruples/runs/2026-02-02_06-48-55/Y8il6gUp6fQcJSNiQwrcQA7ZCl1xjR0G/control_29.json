Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times in the past, but generally doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend started doubting his sexuality after a nervous experience during their first sexual encounter. She discussed this with a friend who suggested he might be gay, leading to her repeated questioning, including checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word, especially given that his girlfriend is bi and should understand the importance of trusting each other's identities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend's behavior seems to stem from insecurity or curiosity, but repeatedly questioning someone's stated sexuality can be hurtful. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels his identity is being doubted without cause. However, the girlfriend might have her reasons, like past experiences or her own insecurities. The fact that she checked his porn history raises red flags about privacy invasion. \n\nIn 2019, the author argues that being comfortable with one's sexuality is expected, and he feels he should be trusted when he says he's straight. His girlfriend's continued doubt could be seen as undermining his autonomy and trust. The friend's involvement adds another layer, suggesting that the girlfriend might be seeking validation from others rather than trusting her partner. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns about the initial sexual performance issue. However, she should address that directly with him instead of jumping to conclusions about his sexuality. The author's right to feel upset about being questioned repeatedly is valid, especially if it's causing him stress. Trust is a cornerstone of relationships, and constant questioning without evidence could erode that trust.\n\nIt's important to note that while the author is heterosexual, the principle of respecting someone's self-identified sexuality applies regardless of orientation. The girlfriend isn't in a position to question his identity based on external factors. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being doubted and having his privacy invaded (checking porn history). The situation points to communication issues that need addressing, but the core issue here is the girlfriend overstepping by not trusting his self-identification.\n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because his frustration is justified given the repeated questioning and invasion of privacy, and the girlfriend is the one who's overstepping by not taking his identity at face value.\n"
