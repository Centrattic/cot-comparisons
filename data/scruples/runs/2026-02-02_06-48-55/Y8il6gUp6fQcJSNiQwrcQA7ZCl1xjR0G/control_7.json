Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend keeps asking if he's gay, even after he's told her he's straight. The girlfriend is bisexual, and she got the idea from a friend after he had some initial nervousness during sex. He feels it's frustrating and hypocritical, especially since his girlfriend is bi and he's in a committed relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality before but usually doesn't mind. His girlfriend, though, keeps questioning him, even checking his porn history. He's annoyed because he feels he should be taken at his word, given the time they've been together. He also mentions feeling it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Let's consider both perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side: Trust in a relationship is important. If he's communicated his sexuality clearly, it's reasonable for him to expect his partner to respect that. Constant questioning and invading privacy (like checking porn history) can be seen as distrustful. His frustration is valid because he's being asked repeatedly, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: Sometimes, when people are in a relationship, especially with someone who has different orientations, there might be insecurities. The girlfriend's friend suggested the idea, and maybe she's struggling with her own doubts or trust issues. However, repeatedly questioning and checking up on him might not be healthy. \n\nThe author's argument is that if he were gay, he would know by now. That's a personal belief, but it's his right to state his sexuality. However, the girlfriend's actions (checking his history) are invasive and could indicate a lack of trust. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to express his feelings about the repeated questioning and the privacy invasion. However, being annoyed is understandable. The girlfriend's actions could be a sign of insecurity or not trusting his honesty. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's been honest and the girlfriend isn't respecting that, then maybe not. But if he's dismissing her feelings or not addressing her concerns constructively, that could be an issue. However, the main problem seems to be the girlfriend's lack of trust and the author's frustration with being questioned repeatedly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. His frustration is valid given the context. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
