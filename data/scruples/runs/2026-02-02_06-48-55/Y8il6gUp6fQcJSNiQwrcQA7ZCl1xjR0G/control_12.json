Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The situation involves the girlfriend suspecting he's gay, checking his porn history, and continuing to ask even after he's affirmed he's straight. The author feels it's 2019 and that he shouldn't have to defend his sexuality, especially since his girlfriend is bisexual, so he thinks she should be more accepting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend's actions: she's concerned, maybe because of his initial nervousness during sex and the fact that the author might be giving off a vibe. She told her friend, who suggested he might be gay. Then she started questioning him, even checking his history. Repeated questioning despite his answers could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. The author is getting annoyed because he feels he's being accused without trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or curiosity. Since she's bisexual, maybe she's trying to figure out the dynamics of the relationship. But checking his porn history without consent is a big issue. That's a privacy violation. Also, if it's happening multiple times, it's not just a one-off concern but a recurring problem, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author's perspective is that in 2019, being straight shouldn't require constant affirmation. He's heterosexual and feels his identity is being doubted. The girlfriend's actions are making him question why his statement isn't enough, which is valid. The hypocrisy comes into play because she's part of the LGBTQ+ community and should understand the importance of self-identification.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's justified in feeling upset if his boundaries are being crossed. The girlfriend shouldn't be questioning him repeatedly without cause, especially after he's already addressed the concern. Checking his history is a breach of trust. The author's anger stems from being disbelieved and not having his autonomy respected. The girlfriend's friend also plays a role here, suggesting the question in the first place.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend needs to respect his answers and not invade his privacy. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being disbelieved and having his privacy violated. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
