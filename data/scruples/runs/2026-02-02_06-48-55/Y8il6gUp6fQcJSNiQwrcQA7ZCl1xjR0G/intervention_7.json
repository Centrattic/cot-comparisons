Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He says he's been asked if he's gay before but usually doesn't mind. Now, his girlfriend has gotten the idea that he might be gay. She's asked him several times, even checked his porn history. He's upset because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality even though he's stated he's straight. He's frustrated that his girlfriend isn't taking him seriously, especially since she's bi and should be accepting. He's in 2019, so he feels this kind of questioning is outdated.\n\nSo, why is the girlfriend doing this? She got the idea from her friend after he had trouble climaxing during their first sex. Maybe she's insecure or trying to understand his orientation? But repeatedly questioning and invading his privacy by checking his porn history is problematic. The author might feel disrespected here. \n\nThe key points are: the author has clearly stated his sexuality, the girlfriend isn't respecting that, and the author is frustrated. The user initially thought the author is wrong but now wants my opinion. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a committed relationship and expected his partner to trust him. The girlfriend's actions (searching through his history) are a violation of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to being disbelieved and disrespected despite his clear communication. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or needs reassurance. But even so, her methods are intrusive and not healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
