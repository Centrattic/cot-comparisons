Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, but he's used to it. Now, his girlfriend has started questioning his sexuality again, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he's stated he's straight, and he feels she's not taking him seriously. He's upset that he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he thinks if he were gay, he'd know by now. The girlfriend's friend is also involved in prompting these questions.\n\nThe key points here are trust, respect, and communication. The author is upset because he feels his words aren't being respected. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, might be a breach of privacy. Also, the fact that he's heterosexual and the girlfriend is bisexual adds another layer. The author might feel that the situation is hypocritical because the girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community, which should understand the importance of respecting someone's self-identification.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reasons for asking are important. She might be dealing with her own insecurities or trying to understand his behavior. The initial issue during sex might have caused her to doubt his sexuality. However, repeatedly questioning him after he's already stated he's straight could be seen as not respecting his boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to trust each other. If the girlfriend doesn't trust his self-identification, that's a problem. The author is within his right to feel frustrated if he's been clear and she's still doubting him. The girlfriend's friend being involved might indicate that the girlfriend isn't addressing the issue directly with him, which could lead to unnecessary conflicts.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be struggling with her own uncertainties. She's bi, so maybe she's used to questioning her own sexuality and is projecting that onto him. But that doesn't justify not taking his words as valid. The author isn't in the position to be criticized for being upset about being asked repeatedly.\n\nAlso, considering societal progress, the author's frustration is valid. If someone's identity is clearly stated, others should respect that. The fact that the girlfriend isn't respecting his stated sexuality, even after multiple confirmations, seems to be the issue here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend and her friend are overstepping by not taking his sexuality at face value and prying into his privacy. The author has a right to be frustrated when his self-identification is repeatedly questioned. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
