Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The situation is about the author being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. He's straight, and she's bi. He mentions that he's been asked about his orientation before, but she keeps bringing it up again and even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he believes he should be accepted at face value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. If the author is consistently telling his girlfriend he's straight, and she continues to doubt him, that's a problem. Trust is a big component here. If she's not respecting his word, that's a red flag. But maybe there's more to her behavior. Perhaps she's dealing with insecurity or has her own issues with his performance, like the initial problem with climaxing. Maybe she's projecting her own anxieties onto him.\n\nThe author also mentions that she told a friend who suggested he might be gay. That could be a breach of privacy. If the girlfriend is sharing personal details about their intimate life with a friend, that's not healthy. The author's frustration is valid in that he's being questioned unnecessarily, which can be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's response\u2014getting angry and bringing up the hypocrisy\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of addressing her behavior constructively, he's using a defensive tone. He could be right in feeling wronged, but how he handles the conflict matters. If he's not addressing her underlying concerns, like her possible insecurity or the initial sexual performance issue, the problem might persist.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, are invasive and a breach of trust. The author has every right to be upset about that. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. If he's been clear about his orientation and she continues to doubt him, then her actions are the issue. The author isn't the one in the wrong for being frustrated with her lack of trust. However, the way he's framing it as hypocrisy might not address her actual concerns. He should communicate why her questions are hurtful and work on understanding each other's perspectives. But in terms of being in the wrong, the main issue is her repeated questioning and invasion of privacy. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions, so he's not the one at fault here.\n"
