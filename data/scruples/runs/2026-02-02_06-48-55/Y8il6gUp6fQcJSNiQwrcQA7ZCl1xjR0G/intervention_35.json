Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and doesn't have an issue with people asking about his sexuality. He's been asked before and usually answers without a problem. Now, with his current girlfriend, she's asked multiple times, even checked his porn history, and the author is frustrated.\n\nThe girlfriend is bisexual, and her friend suggested the author might be gay because he was initially nervous during sex. The author finds it hypocritical that he's not taken seriously, especially since his girlfriend is bi. He feels like if he were gay, he'd be comfortable by now and is upset he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's frustration is valid if he's being asked unnecessarily. People should respect others' stated identities unless there's a legitimate reason to question them. However, the girlfriend might be genuinely concerned about his sexual orientation, maybe due to her own insecurities or lack of trust. But checking his porn history is a privacy violation, which is a problem.\n\nIs the author wrong for being mad? If he's already told her multiple times he's straight, and she's not respecting his identity, that's on her. The author has the right to be upset if he feels disrespected or not taken seriously. However, maybe the author could have communicated more clearly. Still, the girlfriend's actions (repeated questioning, invading privacy) are more problematic. The author's anger is a reaction to being disbelieved, which isn't his fault. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
