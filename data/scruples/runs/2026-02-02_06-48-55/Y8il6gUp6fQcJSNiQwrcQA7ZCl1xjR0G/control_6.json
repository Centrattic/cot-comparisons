Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past but doesn't mind confirming he's straight. Now, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, keeps questioning his sexuality, even checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he needs to defend his identity, which he finds exhausting, especially given that he's not part of the LGBTQ+ community and expects acceptance.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's frustration is valid because being repeatedly questioned about one's sexuality can be annoying and undermine trust. However, the girlfriend might have her reasons, like insecurity or curiosity. But since the author has clearly stated he's straight each time, her continued questioning could be seen as not respecting his word. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend searching through his phone is a privacy issue. Trust in a relationship should be built on mutual respect, and invading privacy can cause more harm than good. The author's anger is understandable here. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend feels the need to confirm due to her own experiences or past relationships. But even so, if someone has already communicated their stance clearly, it's important to take them at their word. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being doubted, especially when it's affecting their relationship dynamics. \n\nSo the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because he's justified in feeling frustrated with his girlfriend's persistent doubts and privacy invasion.\n"
