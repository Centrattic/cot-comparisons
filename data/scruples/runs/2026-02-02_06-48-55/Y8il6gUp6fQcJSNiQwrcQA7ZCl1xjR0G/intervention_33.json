Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The main issue is that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. The author got annoyed when she asked again and is now wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend initially thought he might be gay because of some nervousness during sex, and then a friend suggested it. She then asked him, and he clarified he's straight. But she keeps bringing it up, even checking his porn history. Now he's upset because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and is frustrated that she doesn't take him seriously.\n\nThe author argues that in 2019, he should be comfortable with his sexuality, and it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi. He feels it's not accepting of his identity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my take.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are: repeated questioning despite clear answers, invasion of privacy (checking porn history), and the author's frustration. The girlfriend's behavior could stem from insecurity or lack of trust. If she's bi, maybe she's projecting her own sexuality onto him? Or maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is valid. Being asked repeatedly can be hurtful and dismissive. Trust is a two-way street. If one partner doesn't trust the other's sexuality after being told, that's a problem. The author's anger might be a reaction to feeling disrespected. But is he wrong for being angry? If the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries by checking his history and keeps questioning, maybe she's the one in the wrong. But the author's response\u2014getting mad\u2014might not address the underlying issues. He could have communicated his feelings better. However, the fact that she's persistently not taking his word at face value is problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. He has the right to feel disrespected and frustrated. But he could have handled it more constructively. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions are the root cause, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But if he overreacted, maybe there's some fault. It's tricky. The girlfriend's behavior is definitely contributing, but the author's reaction is a response to that. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the situation, I might lean towards B. The author isn't wrong for being frustrated with her lack of trust and repeated questioning. The onus is on the girlfriend to respect his answers and not invade his privacy. So the author isn't at fault for getting mad in this context.\n"
