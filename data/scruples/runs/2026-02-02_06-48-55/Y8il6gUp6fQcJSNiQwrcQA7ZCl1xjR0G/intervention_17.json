Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality before, which he's okay with. His girlfriend started thinking he might be gay, possibly due to his nervousness during their first sexual encounters. She shared this with a friend, who then suggested he's gay. The girlfriend keeps asking, even checked his porn history, and the author is getting frustrated because he's straight and feels he's not being believed.\n\nSo the main issue here is the repeated questioning and the girlfriend's actions. The author feels he's in the right to be upset because he's affirmed his straightness, and the girlfriend isn't accepting that. The girlfriend's friend is also part of this, as she's the one who initially suggested he's gay.\n\nFrom a perspective of respect in a relationship, trust is important. If someone has stated their sexuality clearly, and the other person continues to doubt or question it without valid reasons, that's an issue. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and not respectful of his privacy. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable with that.\n\nThe girlfriend might have her own reasons for doubting, maybe insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author isn't obligated to defend his sexuality repeatedly. It's valid for him to be upset about being treated as if he's hiding something when he's not.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if there's communication issues. The author might need to address why the girlfriend is so insistent. Maybe there's underlying trust issues or misunderstandings. But in terms of right and wrong, the repeated questioning and invasive actions from the girlfriend are problematic.\n\nThe author's frustration is justified because he's been clear about his orientation and is being challenged unnecessarily. The girlfriend isn't respecting his self-identification. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad about that. The responsibility lies more on the girlfriend for not accepting his statement and for her actions.\n"
