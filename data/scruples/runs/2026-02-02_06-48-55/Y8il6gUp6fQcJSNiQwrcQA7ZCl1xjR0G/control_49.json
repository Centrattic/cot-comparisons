Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read the details again.\n\nThe author is a straight man in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She keeps questioning his sexuality, asking if he's gay again and even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels like he's had to defend his sexuality and that she doesn't take him seriously. The girlfriend's friend might have influenced her to think he's gay. The author is upset because he feels like it's 2019 and if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. He's annoyed that he has to explain himself repeatedly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is questioning his sexuality multiple times after he's already stated he's straight. That seems like an issue of trust or insecurity. The author isn't the one in the LGBTQ+ community here; he's heterosexual, and the girlfriend is bisexual. The girlfriend's actions\u2014checking his porn history\u2014could be a breach of privacy and trust. The author is justified in feeling upset about that invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her reasons. Maybe she's insecure because of her bisexuality or past experiences. But it's not the author's job to constantly reassure her. Healthy relationships require mutual trust. If she can't trust her partner's self-identified sexuality, that's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated when his boundaries are crossed (like the porn history check) and when he's asked repeatedly, showing a lack of respect for his stated identity.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend is just trying to be open and honest, but her approach is off. However, the repeated questioning and invasive actions are not healthy. The author isn't the one who needs to come out; he's already clear. The girlfriend's actions are undermining his autonomy. Also, the author is correct in pointing out hypocrisy, as LGBTQ+ people often face similar issues, but the expectation here is that once stated, it's accepted.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
