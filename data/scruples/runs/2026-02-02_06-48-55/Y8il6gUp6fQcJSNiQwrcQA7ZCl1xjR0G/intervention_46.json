Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author getting angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The girlfriend is bisexual, and he's heterosexual. He mentions that he's been asked before but usually just says he's straight. Now, the girlfriend questioned him again, even searched his porn history, and he's frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that he's clearly stated he's straight, so the repeated questioning is annoying and disrespectful. The girlfriend might be concerned about his nervousness during sex, which could be due to anxiety or other issues, but she's jumping to conclusions about his sexuality. \n\nBut maybe there's an underlying issue here. The girlfriend might be feeling insecure or not fully trusting him, especially if she brought it up after her friend suggested it. The fact that she looked through his porn history is a red flag. Trust is important in a relationship, and invading privacy like that without consent is inappropriate. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's a heterosexual man, and if he's communicated that clearly, repeated questioning could be seen as not respecting his autonomy. However, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities. But that doesn't justify prying into his private data. \n\nThe author's reasoning that if he were gay he'd have figured it out by now might be a bit dismissive. Not everyone comes to terms with their sexuality in the same timeline. However, given that he's been open about being straight, maybe the girlfriend's persistence is unwarranted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think the main issue here is the girlfriend's behavior\u2014questioning repeatedly and invading privacy. The author's anger seems justified in that context. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
