Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, which he's okay with. Now, his girlfriend is questioning him, which is making him frustrated. She even checked his porn history. He feels like he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since she's bi. He's upset because it's 2019 and he thinks it's past time to accept people's self-identified sexuality.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, it's valid for someone to question their partner's sexuality if there are concerns, but repeatedly doubting and checking on them could be controlling. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through his history, might be an invasion of privacy. The author is frustrated that he's not being taken at face value when he states his sexuality.\n\nBut the girlfriend might have her reasons. Maybe she's insecure, or there's some past experience making her question. However, if the author has consistently stated he's straight, then repeated questioning without valid reasons could be problematic. The author's frustration is understandable because he's being asked to prove his sexuality, which isn't fair. Also, the girlfriend's friend influencing her thoughts might not be healthy.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the main issue is the girlfriend's persistent doubt and the intrusive behavior. The author being upset about that seems justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry. Since he's the one being questioned without trust, I think he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
