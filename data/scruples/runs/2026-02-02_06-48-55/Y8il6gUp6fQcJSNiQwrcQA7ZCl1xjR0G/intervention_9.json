Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend has repeatedly questioned his sexuality, which has made him frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels it's frustrating to have to defend his straightness, especially since he's been clear. The girlfriend might be concerned because of his initial nervousness during sex and the suggestion from her friend. But the key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author is getting annoyed because the questions are recurring. He's not the one questioning his sexuality; he's stating it clearly. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be seeking reassurance or dealing with her own insecurities. However, searching through his porn history is a privacy invasion and not a respectful way to address her concerns.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should assess if his frustration is justified. Being in a relationship requires trust. If the author has communicated his straightness clearly and the girlfriend continues to doubt it without valid reason, that's a problem. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected and not taken seriously, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions (searching through private data) are problematic. The author isn't at fault for being upset about that. The fact that it's 2019 and he's still having to defend his sexuality might indicate a lack of trust from the girlfriend, which shouldn't be necessary if the relationship is healthy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong for being frustrated. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasive actions are the main issues here. The author's reaction is a response to her not respecting his stated sexuality and privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
