Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author says he's straight and that he's been asked before but usually doesn't mind. Now, with his girlfriend, she's been questioning him several times, even checked his porn history. He's annoyed because he feels he has to defend himself and it's hypocritical given she's bi and the current year, implying it should be more accepted.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. She might be concerned because of his initial nervousness during sex. Maybe she's worried about his feelings towards her or the relationship. But repeatedly questioning and checking his history could be a sign of insecurity or lack of trust. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he's being asked the same question multiple times without reason. It's about trust and respect in the relationship. However, his initial nervousness might have given her a reason to be uncertain. But if he has consistently stated he's straight and the behavior continues, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend influenced her to question him. The friend's role here is questionable too, but the main issue is between the couple. The author might be justified in feeling disrespected, especially if his identity is being doubted despite clear communication. \n\nBut the author also mentions it's 2019 and he's comfortable with his sexuality. If that's the case, why is there a need for constant questioning? The girlfriend's actions might stem from her own issues rather than the author's behavior. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to feel disrespected when his sexuality is doubted, and the girlfriend's behavior that's causing the issue. The author might not be in the wrong if his feelings are reasonable. However, maybe he should consider why she's so insecure. But given the context, he's already communicated his stance clearly. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasion of privacy (checking porn history) could be the main problems. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. His frustration is justified, especially if the girlfriend isn't respecting his stated identity after multiple confirmations. The answer should be B.\n"
