Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is a self-identified heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. The main issue is that the girlfriend, influenced by a friend, keeps doubting his sexuality, leading to frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect in relationships. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and if someone states their sexuality, others should respect that unless there's a compelling reason to doubt it. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and even checking his porn history seems invasive and disrespectful. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, so her actions might be undermining that trust.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. It's 2019, and he feels he should be comfortable with his identity. Being forced to defend one's sexuality repeatedly can be exhausting and hurtful. The girlfriend's friend also plays a role here by spreading the idea that he might be gay, which isn't helpful.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for doubting. Maybe she's experienced similar situations before or has personal insecurities. But even so, her approach\u2014questioning and invading privacy\u2014crosses a boundary. The author isn't the one violating trust here; the girlfriend is by not respecting his stated identity and privacy.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to counter that. The key points are the repeated questioning without cause, the invasion of privacy, and the lack of trust. These actions from the girlfriend are problematic. The author isn't wrong for being upset about being disrespected and having his sexuality doubted without reason. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
