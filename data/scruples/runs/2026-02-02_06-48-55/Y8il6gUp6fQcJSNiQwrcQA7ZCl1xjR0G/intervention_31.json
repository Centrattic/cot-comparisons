Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, which he's okay with. Now, his girlfriend started doubting he's straight because he had some initial issues during sex. She even checked his porn history and asked again. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he's not part of the LGBTQ+ community and expects to be believed when he says he's straight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and respect. If the author has already told his girlfriend he's straight, but she continues to question him, that's a problem. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. It's reasonable for the author to feel hurt or annoyed if a partner doesn't take his word at face value. The girlfriend's actions, like searching his phone, breach privacy. \n\nAlso, the author isn't in the position of someone coming out or dealing with stigma; he's comfortable with his sexuality. His frustration stems from being doubted without evidence. The girlfriend's friend contributing to this doubt isn't helpful either. \n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend's concerns are about the initial performance issues. Maybe she's worried about his comfort or health. However, the way she's handling it\u2014repeated questioning and invading privacy\u2014crosses a line. \n\nThe author isn't being judgmental about her bisexuality, but he's the one being questioned persistently. He's right to feel that he should be trusted and that his sexuality isn't under scrutiny in the same way he respects hers. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. His frustration is justified because trust and privacy are being violated here. The girlfriend needs to respect his self-identification without constant doubt. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
