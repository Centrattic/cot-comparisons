Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given Reddit-style post is in the wrong for getting angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nSo the situation is: the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend has asked him multiple times if he's gay, even checking his porn history. The author is upset because he feels he should be taken at face value when he says he's straight, especially since the girlfriend is bi and in 2019, he thinks it's outdated to question someone's sexuality like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the author's side, he's frustrated because he's being forced to defend his sexuality repeatedly, which he finds unnecessary and disrespectful. He might feel that trust is being violated, especially with the porn history search. On the girlfriend's side, she might have reasons for her suspicions\u2014maybe his initial performance anxiety during sex or some other behavior made her doubt. However, repeatedly questioning and invading privacy (checking porn history) is problematic.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's actions of questioning and invading privacy could be seen as a lack of trust. Even if she's coming from a place of insecurity, it's not healthy to repeatedly challenge someone's identity and check their devices without permission. The author has the right to be upset about that invasion of privacy and the lack of trust.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for being mad. However, the post also suggests that he's dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings and the context. Maybe she's struggling with her own insecurities because she's bisexual, and the author could be more empathetic. But the act of checking his porn history without consent is a clear boundary violation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend told her friend about his performance anxiety, leading the friend to speculate about his sexuality. That could indicate that the girlfriend is sharing personal information, which isn't healthy. So, her actions might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he's being asked to justify his identity, which can be hurtful. However, the way he's phrased his response might come off as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being angry, not about how he expressed it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's behavior is more in the wrong here because of the lack of trust and privacy invasion. The author's anger is a reasonable reaction to that. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
