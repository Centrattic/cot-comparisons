Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being repeatedly questioned about his sexuality by his girlfriend, who suspects he's gay, despite him stating he's straight. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, and he thinks his girlfriend, who is bisexual, isn't taking his identity seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is heterosexual and has been open about it, but his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. This could stem from her own insecurities, curiosity, or maybe past experiences. The fact that she even went through his porn history might indicate a lack of trust, which is problematic in a relationship. Trust is crucial, and invading privacy like that can lead to resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his identity is being doubted, which is hurtful. He's upset because he feels he has to \"prove\" his sexuality, which is a valid frustration. However, it's important to examine why the girlfriend is doing this. Is it because of her bisexuality making her unsure, or is there something else? If the girlfriend is not respecting his identity after he's clearly stated it, that's a red flag. \n\nBut then, the author is getting mad at her for questioning him repeatedly. While it's understandable to be frustrated, maybe there's a communication issue here. He might need to address why she's doubting him instead of just getting angry. However, if she's not respecting his boundaries (like checking his phone), that's a bigger issue. \n\nAlso, the timeline is important. They've been dating five months, and the questioning has been ongoing. The girlfriend's actions might be causing unnecessary stress. The author's reaction is justified if the questioning is persistent and invasive. However, if he's not communicating his feelings to her, that could be part of the problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, the user mentions it's 2019 and he should be comfortable with his sexuality, implying that his frustration is due to her not accepting his identity. But the girlfriend's actions might stem from her own issues rather than his actual sexuality. \n\nI think the key points are the invasion of privacy (checking his porn history) and the lack of trust from the girlfriend. The author has the right to be upset about that. However, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for feeling insecure. But overall, the author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated with her repeated questioning and lack of trust. The girlfriend's actions are more to blame here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
