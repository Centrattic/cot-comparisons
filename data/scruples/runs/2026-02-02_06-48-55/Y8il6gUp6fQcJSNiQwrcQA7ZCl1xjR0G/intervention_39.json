Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, but usually, people just accept his answer. However, his girlfriend, influenced by her friend, keeps questioning him even after he's told her he's straight. The user thinks the author might be at fault but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's repeated questioning despite the answer could be a trust issue or insecurity. Maybe she's worried about his orientation affecting the relationship. The fact that she checked his porn history is a red flag. Privacy invasion is a big deal regardless of the reason. The author's frustration is understandable because he's being forced to defend his sexuality, which can be stressful. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, everyone has the right to feel respected and not be doubted. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through his history, are not healthy. However, if the author reacts with anger without understanding her concerns, that could also harm the relationship. He might need to communicate why her actions hurt him. \n\nThe key points: The girlfriend's lack of trust is problematic, but the author's response should be constructive. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated, but maybe the way he expressed it. The girlfriend's friend is also part of the issue by spreading doubts. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), but the situation needs better communication from both sides. The main fault lies with the girlfriend and her friend for not respecting his answer, not the author for feeling upset.\n"
