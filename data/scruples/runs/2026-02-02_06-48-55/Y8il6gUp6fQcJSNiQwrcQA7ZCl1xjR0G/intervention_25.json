Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual female. His girlfriend has been questioning his sexuality multiple times, even going so far as to check his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels like he's had to defend his straightness, even though he gave her a direct answer. He's upset that she doesn't take him seriously and even compares it to the challenges LGBTQ+ people face, suggesting that it's 2019 and he should be comfortable with his identity by now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly states he's straight and feels it's frustrating to be questioned repeatedly. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for doubting. Maybe she's noticed something during their intimacy, like his initial nervousness and trouble climaxing, which she might interpret as possible signs of being gay. She told her friend, who then suggested he might be gay, leading her to ask again.\n\nBut the key issue here is trust. If the author has told his girlfriend he's straight, and she's still questioning him, that can be seen as a breach of trust. In a healthy relationship, once someone states their sexuality, unless there's a valid reason to doubt (like contradictory behavior), the other person should respect their partner's self-identification. The fact that the girlfriend checked his porn history is a privacy violation and not okay. That's a red flag.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being repeatedly questioned about one's sexuality after a direct answer can be hurtful and invalidating. He's in a position where he has to \"defend\" his straightness, which shouldn't be necessary in a trusting relationship. The girlfriend's actions, especially involving her friend and invading his privacy, are problematic.\n\nThe author comparing his situation to the challenges LGBTQ+ people face is a bit tricky. He's not saying he's in the same situation, but he's pointing out that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable now, so why isn't his statement enough? However, his frustration is about being asked again and again, which is different from the experience of someone in the LGBTQ+ community who might be struggling with their identity. His frustration is valid, but the context is different.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he got angry because his girlfriend doesn't take him at his word and invades his privacy, then no, he's not wrong to be upset. The girlfriend's behavior is inappropriate. The author isn't being judgmental about her bisexuality; he's just frustrated with her not respecting his statement. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
