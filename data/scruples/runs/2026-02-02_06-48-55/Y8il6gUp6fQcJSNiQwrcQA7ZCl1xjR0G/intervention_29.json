Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality because he gives off a vibe that makes people think he's gay. He doesn't mind usually, but his girlfriend keeps questioning him. \n\nHe mentions that during their early sexual encounters, he was nervous and had trouble climaxing, which his girlfriend discussed with her friend. The friend suggested maybe he's gay, leading the girlfriend to keep asking. The author is frustrated because he's been clear about being straight, and now he feels he has to defend his sexuality.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are key. The girlfriend is repeatedly doubting the author's sexuality after he's already confirmed he's straight. That's not healthy. The fact that she even checked his porn history is invasive and shows a lack of trust. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because being questioned constantly about one's sexuality, especially when it's already been stated, can be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions, influenced by her friend's assumption, are not justified unless there's a legitimate reason. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being treated as if he's hiding something. \n\nHowever, the author's initial nervousness during sex might have given the girlfriend a reason to question it, but once he explained it was just nerves, she should respect that. The girlfriend's continued questioning and the invasive action of checking his porn history are the main issues here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
