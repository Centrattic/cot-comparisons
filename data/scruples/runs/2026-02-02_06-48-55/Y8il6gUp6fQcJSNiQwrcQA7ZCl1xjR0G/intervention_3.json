Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. The author is getting frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and is annoyed that she doesn't take his word for it. He also mentions that she mentioned a friend's opinion and even checked his porn history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that it's frustrating to be constantly questioned about his sexuality, especially in a time where he believes people should be more accepting. He feels that if he were gay, he'd have come out by now, and he's tired of defending his heterosexuality. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for doubting. Maybe she's had past experiences where people weren't truthful, or she's genuinely concerned because of the initial hesitation during sex. Her bisexuality might also make her more open to considering different possibilities, but that doesn't necessarily justify her actions.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Is the author justified in his frustration? If someone in a relationship is being questioned repeatedly about their sexuality despite clearly stating their orientation, that can be disrespectful. However, the girlfriend might feel that her concerns are valid based on her observations. The author's annoyance is understandable, but he shouldn't react by being angry without understanding her perspective. Conversely, the girlfriend shouldn't persist in questioning if he's already explained himself. There's a communication issue here. The key point is whether the author's anger is justified. If he's been clear and she's still not respecting his boundaries, then maybe he's right to be upset. But if her questioning is due to genuine concerns she hasn't addressed, then she might be in the wrong. However, given that he's already stated his sexuality multiple times, her continued questioning without taking his word could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. So, the author's frustration is valid, but he might need to address it calmly rather than just being angry. Alternatively, the girlfriend might need to reassess why she's not trusting his word. The correct answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is proportional. If he's getting mad without trying to understand her motivations, he might be in the wrong. But if he's exhausted by her lack of trust despite his honesty, then maybe not. I think the author is not in the wrong because he's been clear, and repeated questioning without trust is an issue. So answer B.\n"
