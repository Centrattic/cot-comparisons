Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. She started questioning him after their first time having sex, where he was nervous and didn't climax. Then she told a friend, who suggested maybe he's gay. The girlfriend asked him, he said he's straight, but she keeps asking again and even checked his porn history. Now he's frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, and he's annoyed that she doesn't take him seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are that the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality despite his clear answers. The author feels this is unnecessary and he's tired of it. He's also pointing out the hypocrisy because his girlfriend is bi but he's the one being doubted.\n\nIn terms of relationships, trust and respect are important. If someone is being questioned repeatedly about their sexuality after they've expressed it, that can be seen as a lack of trust. The girlfriend might be struggling with her own insecurities or have some misconceptions. Maybe she's projecting her own experiences or has trust issues. However, the author has a right to feel frustrated if his identity is being doubted. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, are invasive and cross a privacy boundary. That's a problem regardless of her reasons. The author's anger at being questioned repeatedly, especially when he's already given a clear answer, is understandable. He's not the one who should be in the wrong here because he's asserting his identity and is tired of being doubted. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable by now. While this might not be true for everyone, it's his personal belief. However, it's important to note that people come out at different times and in different ways. But in this context, the issue is about his girlfriend not respecting his stated identity. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. His girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's being clear and direct, and the repeated questioning without trust is on her. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
