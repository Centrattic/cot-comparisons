Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, which he doesn't mind. But now, his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even checking his porn history. He gets annoyed because he told her he's straight, and he feels like he has to defend it repeatedly. He's upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it, especially since he doesn't understand why she's doubting him given that he's confident in his sexuality.\n\nThe key points here: The girlfriend's repeated questioning despite being told he's straight, the invasion of privacy by checking his porn history, and the author's frustration. The author is upset because he feels his identity is being questioned without reason, and he's not being taken at face value. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side, maybe she's concerned because of the initial sexual performance issues. But if she's bisexual, she might have her own experiences with being questioned or not taken seriously. However, that doesn't justify her actions. Repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality can be hurtful and dismissive, especially after the person has already stated their orientation. The fact that she checked his porn history is a privacy violation, which is a red flag regardless of the reason.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. People should respect each other's self-identified labels without constant questioning. If someone says they're straight, cisgender male, it's generally accepted unless there's a specific reason to doubt it (which there isn't here). The girlfriend's actions come off as distrustful and disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. He has the right to feel frustrated when his identity is repeatedly challenged, and the privacy violation is a serious issue.\n\nSo, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, not the author's reaction to it.\n"
