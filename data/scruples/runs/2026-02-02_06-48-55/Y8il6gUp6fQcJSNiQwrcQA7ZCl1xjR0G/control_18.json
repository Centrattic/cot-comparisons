Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She asked him if he's gay multiple times, even checked his porn history, which is kind of invasive. He's heterosexual and feels frustrated that he has to keep defending his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might be concerned because maybe she's insecure, or she's heard something from her friend. Maybe she's worried about their relationship dynamics. But the author is upset because he feels his identity is being questioned repeatedly, and he's tired of having to explain himself, especially since his girlfriend is bisexual and he thinks she should be more accepting.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and respect. The girlfriend searching through his porn history is a big red flag. That's a violation of privacy, which can really hurt a relationship. Also, if someone is in a relationship, they should trust each other's declarations of their sexuality unless there's actual evidence of infidelity or something else. Questioning someone's sexuality repeatedly without a valid reason can be harmful and dismissive.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. It's 2019, as he mentions, and he feels that if he were gay, he would have come to terms with it by now. He's also pointing out the hypocrisy because he's in a relationship with a bisexual partner, so he expects mutual respect and acceptance of each other's identities. \n\nHowever, maybe there's underlying insecurity in the girlfriend. Perhaps she's not comfortable with bisexuality or has trust issues. But regardless of her reasons, repeatedly questioning his sexuality and invading his privacy isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's main issue is being made to feel like he's wrong for being upset. He's not the one violating trust here. The girlfriend's actions are the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad because he has the right to privacy and trust in the relationship. The responsibility lies with the girlfriend for not respecting those boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions are invasive and disrespectful, and the author is justified in feeling frustrated and annoyed.\n"
