Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She asked him if he's gay multiple times, even checked his porn history. He got annoyed because he feels like he should be taken at his word when he says he's straight. He's frustrated that his girlfriend isn't accepting his statement, especially in 2019. He thinks it's hypocritical since she's bi and he doesn't see why he should have to \"defend\" his sexuality. The girlfriend's friend also seems to be involved in suggesting he might be gay, which adds to his frustration.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author is upset about being questioned repeatedly. Is that valid? Well, trust is a key component in any relationship. If someone says they're straight and the partner keeps doubting them, that can be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might be a privacy violation. That's a red flag. However, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities or reasons for doubting him, maybe due to his nervousness during sex. \n\nBut even so, if he's been clear in his communication, the girlfriend should respect that. The author's frustration makes sense. Being made to \"defend\" one's identity repeatedly can be exhausting. The girlfriend's friend's involvement might indicate she's being influenced by others, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's response is anger, which is a reaction to being disbelieved. However, responding with anger might not be the healthiest way to address the issue. The author could have communicated his feelings calmly and discussed boundaries. The girlfriend might need to work on trust. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issues here are the girlfriend's lack of trust and invasion of privacy. The author's anger is a reaction to those actions. So, while the author might not be entirely in the right for reacting angrily, the primary issue lies with the girlfriend's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed or mad, given the circumstances.\n"
