Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a heterosexual man who's angry at his bisexual girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay, even after he's told her he's straight. The girlfriend's friend might have suggested the idea to her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author feels annoyed because his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even though he's been clear. He mentions that he's been asked before but usually doesn't have issues. The initial problem was his nervousness during sex, which he says hasn't been an issue since. The girlfriend told her friend about this nervousness, leading to more questioning. The author is upset that he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he's in a relationship with a bisexual woman and feels it's 2019, so people should be more accepting.\n\nNow, considering the user's own thought, they think the author is in the wrong but want a different perspective. My job is to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's side: He's stated his sexuality clearly and is frustrated by the repeated questioning. Feeling defensive and needing validation from his partner when he's already been upfront is understandable. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might indicate a lack of trust. The author's anger comes from being made to justify something he's already explained, which can be hurtful in a relationship.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might be struggling with trust issues or perhaps has her own insecurities. Since she's bisexual, maybe there's some internal conflict or she's projecting her own experiences. The friend's influence could be adding to her doubts. Her actions, though, seem intrusive and potentially disrespectful. If the author has been open and honest, her continued questioning without evidence is problematic.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but that seems to overlook the girlfriend's behavior. The main issue is the girlfriend not respecting his answer and continuing to doubt him, which is the opposite of what the author is accusing. The author's right to be upset if his partner isn't taking his words at face value. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are a privacy invasion. That's a significant breach of trust. Even if she's worried, it's not a healthy way to address it. The author's frustration is valid here. The girlfriend might need to examine why she's so insistent on his sexuality, maybe due to personal insecurities, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nThe user might be thinking the author is wrong because they see the girlfriend as part of the LGBTQ+ community and assume she should be more accepting. But the problem isn't about the girlfriend's identity; it's about her not trusting her partner and repeatedly questioning him. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend is the one overstepping by not respecting his declaration and invading his privacy. The author's anger is a reasonable response to her lack of trust and the repeated questioning despite his clear answers.\n"
