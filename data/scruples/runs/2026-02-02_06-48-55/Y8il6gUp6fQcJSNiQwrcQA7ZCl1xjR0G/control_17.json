Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is straight and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times before. He's comfortable stating he's straight but feels his girlfriend doesn't take his answer seriously. The girlfriend is bisexual and seems concerned about the author's sexual orientation, even checking his porn history. \n\nThe author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, and he's upset that his girlfriend and her friend don't accept his answer. He's comparing it to LGBTQ+ people's experiences, implying that if he were gay, he would be okay with it by now. \n\nNow, thinking about social norms and relationships. Trust and respect are key. If a partner is constantly questioning their partner's sexuality despite clear answers, that could be a red flag. The girlfriend's actions of searching through his phone add another layer of invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or past experiences that lead her to question this. But the author has a right to feel disrespected if his honesty isn't being accepted. The author's anger might be justified because he's being made to defend his identity repeatedly, which could be undermining his self-esteem and the trust between them.\n\nThe comparison to LGBTQ+ issues is a bit tricky. The author is correct that many LGBTQ+ individuals face challenges in coming out, but his situation is different. He's not facing rejection for his identity but rather having his identity doubted. His frustration is valid because he's in a position where his self-identification isn't respected.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's behavior is inappropriate, and the author has a right to feel frustrated. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
