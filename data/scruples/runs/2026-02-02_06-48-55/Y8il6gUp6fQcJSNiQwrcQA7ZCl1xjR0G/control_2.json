Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The author identifies as heterosexual, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but doesn't mind answering. However, his girlfriend started questioning it after some initial issues during sex, and even looked at his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since his girlfriend is bi, and he's upset that she and her friend don't take him seriously. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship where his girlfriend is questioning his sexuality despite him stating he's straight. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014asking repeatedly and even checking his porn history\u2014could be seen as a lack of trust. The author is upset because he feels his honesty isn't respected. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for doubting. Maybe the initial sexual hesitation made her question, and her friend's suggestion led her to be suspicious. However, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If someone is questioning their partner's sexuality without solid evidence, that could be problematic. The author's frustration seems valid because he's being asked to prove his sexuality repeatedly, which can be hurtful and unnecessary.\n\nThe author mentions feeling defensive, which is a normal reaction when someone's identity is questioned. It's important to respect each other's identities and verbal affirmations. The girlfriend, as a bi woman, should ideally understand the importance of respecting one's self-identification. However, maybe there's a communication issue here. The author might need to talk to her about how the repeated questioning makes him feel, and she might need to address why she's so skeptical.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being mad? I don't think so. He's expressing frustration at being doubted, which isn't his fault. The wrong here might lie more with the girlfriend for not trusting him. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being upset about being disbelieved. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
