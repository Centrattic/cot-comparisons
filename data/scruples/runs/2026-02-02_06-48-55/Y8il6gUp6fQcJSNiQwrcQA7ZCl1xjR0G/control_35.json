Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual female. She keeps questioning his sexuality, asking if he's gay, even after he's told her he's straight. He's getting annoyed because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and she's not taking him seriously. He's also upset that she searched through his porn history. The question is whether he's at fault for getting mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is heterosexual, which he's stated, and he's not in the closet. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be based on her perception, maybe from his nervousness during sex. But the author isn't in the LGBTQ+ community, so he's not facing the same kind of coming-out challenges. He's frustrated because he feels he can't just be taken at face value when he says he's straight.\n\nNow, looking at the girlfriend's perspective: she might be insecure or has her own issues with his sexuality. Since she's bisexual, maybe she's trying to understand his orientation better. But repeatedly questioning him and invading his privacy by checking his porn history is a boundary issue. That part is definitely problematic. No one should have to tolerate someone searching through their private data without consent.\n\nThe author's reaction is getting mad because he feels disrespected and the questions are unnecessary. Since he's already stated his sexuality, the onus isn't on him to prove it. Her friend's involvement might be adding pressure. The author is justified in feeling frustrated if the questioning is persistent and invasive.\n\nBut maybe there's communication that's missing here. If the author hasn't had a serious conversation with her about his feelings, he might need to address that. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his history\u2014are definitely crossing a line. The author's anger is a response to being disrespected and having his privacy invaded, which is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's angry because she's not respecting his boundaries and invading his privacy, then no. He's not at fault. The problem lies with the girlfriend's behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
